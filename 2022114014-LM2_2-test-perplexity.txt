i began to fear that he would not come	37.5581

he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind	282.8469
de villefort passed on to his own room	57.6897
chapter	nan
the marquis de saintméran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii	1202.0331
noirtiers eye was fixed on the dictionary	51.9022
chapter lxxix	233.8965
dartagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it	139.1683
what do i see cried the lieutenant	43.6336
he called porthos to look at it	122.3651
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh	213.3874
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp true my lord exclaimed la ramee	118.3941
if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments i could even thank you for <UNK> me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your thoughts	216.9629
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south	616.8929
the thin spare man yes the executioner in short asked aramis	796.2434
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	100.2768
i insult you said lord de winter with contempt	86.6169
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart	117.1246
the <UNK> illumined the sea for a hundred paces around	1138.5463
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness	101.2154

what more <UNK> not rich	55784.4141
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	55.5642
dartagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before	133.9227
what do you wish sir asked morrel that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtiers eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hands	144.4357
now if you will come on board m	71.2950
i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me	633.3475
what are your excellencys orders inquired gaetano	251.6113
<UNK> said porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur dartagnan is waiting for you in the stables porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well	105.9873
dartagnan knew what she wanted	120.8619
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger	110.4737
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from <UNK> or <UNK> yes said morrel smiling it was the th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some m heroic action interrupted châteaurenaud	305.8381
count count added she you know that i wait for you at this appeal dartagnan drew kitty quietly away and slipped into the chamber	137.2502

we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross	179.4534
it is the truth however	92.2712
athos and dartagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	243.1300
as for m	85.3113
here am i milady here am i cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress	253.6193
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthoss opinion is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	117.8318
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on	1015.7521
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise	82.2092
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	271.7517
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him	26.6732
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his illhumor	359.1158
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	169.2559
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé	88.2299
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of <UNK> pincers the soldiers throat	3707.0647
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy	1015.0152
a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation to whom does this island belong to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile	303.9156
what says augustine on this subject <UNK> sit <UNK> <UNK> yes let the sermon be clear said the curate	17981.3867
those gilded <UNK> drawers locked like gates of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> come from i know not where and the <UNK> of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	3756.5869
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly	80.5371
well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	162.3710
i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own alas said monte cristo your words <UNK> and <UNK> my heart the more so as you have every reason to hate me	280.9014
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea	118.2956
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered <UNK> sobs	290.5311
monsieur de beaufort or another	96.2192
noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed sum	1007.3925
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop	31.2092
dartagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance	157.9027
<UNK> said albert it is monte cristo and his greek the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée	135.3772
it is for a <UNK> which will last three hours at least	465.7976
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his <UNK> powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	679.8619
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses	406.0005
the room of the retired baker chapter	154.5107
no he knows how to <UNK> fowls to <UNK> the <UNK> and to find his way home by day or by night thats all	1760.6523
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence	136.8720
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret	234.7283
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m	375.4429
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion <UNK> you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject	627.7465

cardinal mazarin as king	1342.0638
how many guns gentlemen twelve replied aramis	1780.0352
she knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold <UNK> an intrepid <UNK> <UNK> with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues	1877.5428
i believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the matter then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her you aramis cried the three friends	94.9854
look after the house wife and i shall be back in two hours and caderousse left the house in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken	101.6492

do not open the pie till you are alone	94.2513
whilst porthos still in bed was <UNK> on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard	289.8619
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude	219.6635
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the cardinal	120.1450
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the <UNK> my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	403.9792
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m	305.1750
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the <UNK>	819.7322
bonacieux yes there are traitors here but by the holy name of the virgin i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am	124.8569
you talk like a <UNK> my friend said caderousse and here is danglars who is a <UNK> clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong	275.9820
she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes	90.5950
morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless	3548.4153
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow	151.0210
morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns	272.9636
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen	295.6069
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	185.0516
gloves of gray kid <UNK> the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old	823.8074
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only <UNK> by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his buttonhole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush	487.1367
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you thats well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he <UNK> me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him	91.3228
maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to <UNK> in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	317.7415
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly	1309.2715
this was m	62.2548
m	nan
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to <UNK> him	397.1619
adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him adieu and think of me oh for ever and ever cried the youth oh i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses	236.2924
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	334.9688
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and <UNK> me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not <UNK> unhappy child the crime is that of your father not <UNK> your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to <UNK> but i cursed my father	682.2563
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard	96.1720
m	nan
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease	78.2895
she loves him devilishly he murmured	512.4443
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that <UNK> a flourishing and prosperous business <UNK> of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long <UNK> of the court filled with <UNK> of goods <UNK> with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom	2315.2234
the young king approached his mother and said why do as these people ask it must be so my son said anne of austria	87.0793
the riot	1989.0762
it is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious work and i shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages	292.1591
one doesnt hit the <UNK> every time it is something to hit inside the ring	1911.6869
there seated before a <UNK> table he had brought with him from <UNK> and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fiftytwo years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of <UNK> rather inaccurate but much <UNK> edition of <UNK> work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch	1343.2188
the people who wrote are <UNK> you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the <UNK> of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	377.8626
dartagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind	136.8925
far from wishing my lord to quit paris i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman	171.3122
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless <UNK> her from one prison to another	628.4688
yes you see i am as exact as you are	50.4282
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary at this strange and unexpected demand m	179.0067
they have some capital wine <UNK> to observe that in passing	1391.9388
i can pass as one of the sailors <UNK> last night	922.6311
then m	218.5588
it is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me <UNK> is it madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted	215.1173
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery	152.5831
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep	61.2724
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep	311.7797
through the gate was seen <UNK> carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country	1155.1542
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place	152.6045
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk	1886.3677
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable <UNK> men combined to murder one woman	1725.2518
you who never interest yourself in politics ah without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them	817.6956
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her halffainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream	234.5269
de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted	52.2060
all eyes were turned towards this <UNK> to all except athos he was unknown	872.6870
halloo gentlemen he called out in his gascon accent what do you want	173.2870
well what have you to say	44.2880
i was wrong then no i said what you <UNK> is a crisis at hand	662.3290
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats	494.2091
what six of his eminences guards arrest six of his majestys musketeers _morbleu_ my part is taken i will go straight to the louvre i will give in my resignation as captain of the kings musketeers to take a <UNK> in the cardinals guards and if he refuses me _morbleu_ i will turn abbé at these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and <UNK>	339.6519
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy	261.1352
are we going to continue this pace all night asked planchet	230.7915
danglars in the commissariat department	1130.2006
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself	75.1859
it was nearly ten oclock	49.6468
coquenard saw him swallowing this wine <UNK> and sighed deeply	2795.6213
it led through a grove of <UNK> to a conservatory	4111.8198
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said dartagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make <UNK> and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans	151.1536
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition your arms my <UNK> arms zounds my weapons what weapons my military weapons yes my lord at any rate i think so make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	987.8814
de villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the <UNK>	889.6989
but his majestys decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours dartagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the <UNK> of it	846.8256
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person	246.1243
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur demery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity	216.8825
well i at least resemble the disciples of <UNK> in one thing people spoke in this style in that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saintméran with an air of deep interest	290.8752
look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to dartagnan the scratch he had remembered	122.1515
monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	67.1741
i shall use it again upon occasion and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the <UNK> of the day dartagnan directed his course toward m	296.0485
cannot i serve you as a waiting maid	450.7302
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons	100.7466
you have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight	141.5283
yes replied albert raising his voice	49.2377
oh pray be assured of that franz took his hat and went away in haste	109.7762
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to <UNK> to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day	210.7788
he is dead and no mistake about it oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please so be it said the englishman	340.0306
you look like four conspirators oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning	189.9024
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man	104.9031
i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey <UNK> have taken an oath to obey and i do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent that most sacred in the world said athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty	231.4602
another queen in want of help	320.1893
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to <UNK> halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	156.9864
come gentlemen have you decided cried jussac for the third time	142.0203
bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between leu and dompierre the duc dangoulême on the east from dompierre to perigny and m	785.6685
i thought you were <UNK> a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as <UNK> or _cicerone_ and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own	1226.9919
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerfs brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same <UNK> all our lives but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call	283.5841
as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention	308.1232
this point settled the duke turned to dartagnan	242.2514
am i deceived	290.1207
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not	58.3017
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents life is a <UNK> of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile	1257.1283
i will tell you all replied anne	47.4048
hardly had dartagnan seen through a <UNK> in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication	201.2854
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	45.4089
the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number	653.1125
a duel was the pretext for my wound	340.1349
shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future	216.9827
yes but in order to avenge herself she must be free	100.8433
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell	96.6125
beauty has always been and always will be allpowerful	430.5332
mercédès has no fortune i have none to settle on her	128.2368
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp is it not it is absurd said debray	97.1935

i have not yet had time to see him again	45.3655
and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him	75.4376
at this word athos and aramis jumped up	82.7758
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its <UNK> lamp burning sadly on the table	783.8502
sir said he here is monsieur dartagnans answer but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos	77.5876
noirtier said madame de villefort besides they are to come to paris in about a month and valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m	163.1638
dartagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	376.4810
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude	1685.1169

danglars recollects having seen him	17506.2832
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate	292.0120
you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his <UNK> they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die	271.7903
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure	157.0615

he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants	256.6226
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the <UNK> of the kitchengarden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some <UNK> at a yearly <UNK> of francs	877.5266

ah my dear friend said madame danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact	74.6493
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to obey	88.0217
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed <UNK> on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	455.0883

it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing	205.0363

the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it	164.3357
forsooth if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos	140.0051
certainly not certainly not exclaimed mazarin	295.9505
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugénie became uneasy	141.4972
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening	144.3946

but as regards the letter of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself	206.6842
fortunately i dont know where he is how cried dartagnan you dont know where aramis is formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition	155.9457
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and <UNK> me to address myself to you for information respecting him really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you the count from the moment of first entering the drawingroom had not once lost sight of the expression of the young mans countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these words so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and	122.6460

when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that dartagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind	123.8408
this last apartment was a sort of dark room <UNK> with papers	764.4688
they both stood in amazement at the door	101.0037
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of <UNK> and vexation on his bed	210.0443
come the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristos door	169.1067
franz dépinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart	152.6883
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically and why her rather than another because a mistress is one of the cardinals favorite means he has not one that is more expeditious	342.3872
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet	875.3095
he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour <UNK> is to say fiveandforty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls	471.3179

at length the boat touched the shore but without effort without shock as lips touch lips and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody	1828.7621
without your aid continued he repeating the counts words i should have been a dead <UNK> dead my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	338.1265
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his horses	122.9862

monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france in some parts of <UNK> excellency you know the environs of paris then no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude	273.7246
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye	739.5743

the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past	249.6069
you look careworn really you alarm me	5752.2192
as dartagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends he held out his hand to the wounded man and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches	61.5963
where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i dont know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby	165.1094

monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed	276.8070

the abbés chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbés cell opened from that point the passage became much <UNK> and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees	458.9394

did you ever suffer from a strain athos never though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos said aramis	185.1197
of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a woman	98.1737

dartagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task	721.0955
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor it is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down	143.3418

broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the <UNK> accident from which he had quite <UNK> the bottom of the table	275.4101
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the <UNK> in his hand he pulled it toward him so that dartagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of <UNK> explained by the <UNK> of porthos	391.1630

in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in the massacre of st bartholomew in and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging <UNK> rochelle is impregnable except to famine	429.7394

athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and <UNK> freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	630.8834
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	441.5634
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	208.7582

villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès <UNK> services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleons return	1243.0974
you see its evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a <UNK> take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not	191.8471

adieu my lord adieu my dear rochefort ah monsieur mazarin monsieur mazarin said rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action it was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of st jacques de la boucherie	116.2933
then in addition to these concealed or public secret or open wars there were robbers mendicants huguenots wolves and scoundrels who made war upon everybody	1584.8826
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	93.0730
your friend albert de morcerf	143.3195
go the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory	223.3776
that gentleman is the abbé dherblay replied he	85.1981
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening	203.8407
nevertheless dartagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage	63.8940
baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him	120.7281
creek to the east in a right line	189.8842
it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit	135.0835
this is the second time that monsieur dartagnan has been in england	41.4419
morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the <UNK> effect of all that he saw	794.5234
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips	187.3838
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis thats all i can say how monsieur cried bazin a poem sell so dear as that it is incredible oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade	187.0490
their number was great	311.5245
m i am sorry to see observed monte cristo to morrel that i cause no small disturbance in your house look there said maximilian laughing there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat	149.5183
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours	154.5808
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit	90.0988
the carmelite convent at béthune great criminals bear about them a kind of <UNK> which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes	1548.5675
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	93.2968
for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two <UNK> chambermaid named <UNK> and a hostler called <UNK>	1058.8353
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twentyfour hours what had taken place during this long sleep	201.3837
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest <UNK> of which it is capable	351.7842
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the kings attorney and this kings attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly	116.9505
i should find myself therefore more at my ease <UNK> <UNK> in a subject of my own choice which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to <UNK> in philosophy dartagnan began to be tired and so did the curate	855.6086
to be sure for monsieur de wardes now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur dartagnan go to bed mademoiselle said milady i dont like comments dartagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in	178.5292
molière had not written his scene in <UNK> then	1953.7223
i begin and without any <UNK> allow me porthos said aramis	950.3344
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	35.8396
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention	676.3978
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort	84.0453
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos	148.4905
then said the coadjutor this evening at ten oclock and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion	109.6202
ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize halloo halloo friends to horse to horse several horsemen ran quickly to him	1084.6227
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house	294.3476
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber	86.6719
morrel yes but we will talk of it well then three months said penelon	125.2071
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger	138.4120
this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels	3012.8425
i am from gascony it is true and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel	87.9979
now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls patrick again obeyed	1120.7114
pray observe that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title	330.5475
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	164.3350
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw dear child said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye	142.3127
a little <UNK> little farther said the other	2587.3599
it was the last <UNK> for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate	2336.3201
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty	70.0024
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened	211.1293
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that châteaurenaud did not seek to <UNK> him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion	436.4440
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained	177.6476
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his business here then _pardieu_ he has come to draw but i dont know how much you will know presently my friend very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day what do you <UNK> whom do you speak	148.8084
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance	232.2138
foreigner he ejaculated italian that is their mean yet mighty <UNK> of <UNK> watchword with which they assassinated hanged and made away with concini and if i gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then	1117.8075
i am just setting out for blois	247.1903
everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend	104.0989
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	499.6016
she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed help help m what is the matter asked m	229.6543
andrea made no resistance although he protested against it	1185.8268
i opened the door of the anteroom myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing	132.0472
m yes i think i saw him pass but pray call emmanuel excuse me madame but i must go up to maximilians room this instant replied monte cristo i have something of the greatest importance to tell him go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared	79.6327
he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought	122.0409
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman	107.6277
go morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire	288.9327
i dragged myself as far as the yard	232.5365
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes	78.3390
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air	260.2044
she is allpowerful yonder she will help me	420.4975
him i can place at your disposal it is count de rochefort i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette and wherefore has he not been to see me he was <UNK> lord will pardon me certainly speak that your lordship was about to treat with the court gondy bit his lips	149.8309
dartagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of evil	7123.7876
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other	218.5536
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick exclaimed fool then <UNK> monte cristos receipt in a little pocketbook he <UNK> come at twelve oclock i shall then be far away then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne danglars i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured	895.2628
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	264.7871
what you would now do amounts to treason dartagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent	484.8404
come we shall be alone and can make up our accounts in good time	128.9472
if he lays his hand on the boats edge i will cut it off regicide that he is and i said porthos	1001.5157
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champsélysées on the th of may at seven oclock in the evening and demand of him your father	70.9870
chapter xxix	130291.1562
i love you you permit me to tell you that i dothat is already more happiness than i dared to hope silence said mme	126.1093
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contrary what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed	39.1716
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	184.5256
such as were only beautiful gave their beauty whence without doubt comes the proverb the most beautiful girl in the world can only give what she has such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be <UNK> who would neither have won their spurs in the first place nor their battles afterward without the purse more or less furnished which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow	417.6878
m volume five m m m chapter	1241.1873
i hate him i confess it openly	340.7217
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	105.4069
under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without assistance really captain said dartagnan determined to continue on the <UNK> tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french	555.2619
monte cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint	149.0439
goodevening m	138.9012
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	126.9389
m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that <UNK> will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of <UNK> sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	613.5074
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait	335.5073
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	182.2824
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	110.2866
noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m	74.6439
see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray	218.9155
eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st germain	127.7889
there remained athos and dartagnan	271.7510
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris	171.0962
the counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune	168.8131
be easy monsieur said planchet you do not know me yet	45.1567
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic	227.1228
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	347.4187
come let us talk a little about my father who then am i you <UNK> are my adopted father	650.3499
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied on but morrel albert is your friend simply an acquaintance sir you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me thank you morrel then ringing the bell once look said he to ali who came immediately take that to my <UNK>	182.1381
the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head	177.5606
for in truth i think i have hitherto been deceived in you	71.3639
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say	96.4918
what was all that to scarron	162.1627
he then began to visit his friends of both <UNK> in that strange costume	465.3387
what said kitty blushing	346.4995
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve	349.2779
but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude	1690.2302
edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to <UNK> him they <UNK> nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held <UNK> to his first story	881.7314
yes i and why _you_ because i alone know what that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears indeed said milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for i really cannot tell what you mean and she looked at dartagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away	157.2130
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one	1006.5767
why you must have lost your senses whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us	118.9752
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the <UNK> of the <UNK> in the blood and which might besides be accidental dartagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance	952.3076
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out monsieur de gondy the cardinals enemy no the kings friend said aramis the kings friend you understand	310.6444
is it to make me a captain	47.9031
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table	209.6498
we are rich	51.5998
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of <UNK>	468.0436
he was very taciturn this worthy signor	1205.0645
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of <UNK> <UNK> in a tragedy of that name a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young kings valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in	504.4279
that manner	16846.8555
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so <UNK> an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable <UNK>	1632.1759
athos turned pale	131.1301
you know it is not my fault said morrel	21.9727
the house of thomson french had or francs to pay this month in france and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration	239.9311
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin	568.5817
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow be it so said beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately	198.6956
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him	223.5481
meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the <UNK> of the louvre	238.1342
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent	50.9160
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room	43.9052
oh water is even more scarce than wine your <UNK> has been such a drought come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration	481.6575
coquenard wished him all sorts of <UNK>	4040.3582
chapter xxxvi	250.1718
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i cannot walk courage courage remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for _his_ sake yes yes everything for him	201.7333
goodevening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars	100.9998
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts	71.9920
let out your prisoner	1257.1012
i will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a <UNK> on each word as he proceeded	254.2052
you dont love me	80.7427
bonacieux who was ignorant that dartagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m	139.3602
dartagnan it is for you to accuse her first dartagnan advanced	191.1091
but how do you procure a light oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little <UNK> which was readily supplied dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind	352.3954
we shall descend by the first window in the gallery what next sign your name my lord the duke signed	146.7708
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos <UNK> dartagnans sigh	271.9331
come courage take something mme	4157.5674
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept <UNK>	3462.8296
<UNK> while reading this letter dartagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers	706.2845
now there remains the chevalier or the abbé dherblay as your majesty pleases does he wish to be a bishop no madame something easier to grant what it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville the queen smiled	149.2707
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in <UNK> his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	314.3321
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear <UNK> one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money	568.3799
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single <UNK> oh with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright	480.5469
i am sure i am the first cried morrel i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself before everyone came	146.4553
at length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed horrible said the monk	109.5827
well have you any news athos asked	181.1295
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room	280.3210
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families	1134.9249
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp châteaurenaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist observed debray	201.2992
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot <UNK> have been guided by an invisible <UNK> hand as powerful as that of an enchanter oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched	643.5738
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian oh i shall always love you	126.4059
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe upon my honor said the prince	100.0956
i dont want any supper said caderousse	150.9022
that however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as i am to that of your majesty i ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you the cardinal smiled	77.1699
in fact m	62.8065
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform i declare i expect to look magnificent in it and chose that regiment only from vanity mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son	300.8736
come lets be merciful to every sinner besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present how can you know that	121.8267
in that case let there be no more question of whats past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine <UNK>	324.5428
now said felton we are safe milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted	149.0412
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage	234.9217
he pretends the air of the faubourg sainthonoré is not good for me indeed said morrel in that m	121.8226
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	168.2931
my god my lord i have long despised thee pardon me my god receive me oh my lord caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan	168.3872
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father	172.5598
here excellency said peppino offering him a little <UNK> knife and a <UNK> fork	4970.0903
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could	244.8883
i depend upon you to escort me home	315.4399
in a moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her sons arm	51.3293
without <UNK> his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	1423.9968
i comprehend	3291.4421
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper	1533.8424
dartagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him	53.6003
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father i will live morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment	104.7130
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	184.6561
m	nan
oh my god i have suffered enough surely have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château dif uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with <UNK> sail <UNK> the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailors eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan	277.8524
grief has consumed her said <UNK> grief doctor after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	364.9980

why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed <UNK> as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	431.8301
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence	171.7608
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some <UNK> scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then	248.5589
poor dear girl but what can i do with you	45.5011

valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction	224.6414
you are a man of taste	47.2576
dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the <UNK> of the old <UNK>	265.8574
a terrible fear transfixed him	143184.4688

monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around	160.0643
she read it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	197.1418
but said the count so great was ali pashas confidence that on his deathbed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave	109.4713
in three seconds dartagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos and one for aramis at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log	297.4196
he is pursued but where is he	91.2005
these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he took no notice of them	203.4591
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell you have some plan then asked athos	306.3683

the rue richelieu and the rue <UNK> were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was <UNK> inhabited <UNK>	2456.7610
with discretion dartagnan remained behind but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold he turned round and seeing the hesitation of the young man come in cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majestys presence tell her what you have seen encouraged by this invitation dartagnan followed the duke who closed the door after them	117.5677

at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers	183.1418

oh no no do not go away exclaimed dartagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you <UNK> such a man as you aramis and he threw himself into the arms of athos	164.3035

smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	409.0318
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained	165.2458
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments	75.5648

but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois	1165.8763

in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your <UNK> an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled several persons hurried up to m	331.5407
he laughs best who laughs last	152120.9531
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular <UNK> of soldiers	1890.0449
thanks said the latter closing the register with a <UNK> i have all i want now it is for me to perform my promise	194.2174
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast	70.6839
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to <UNK> disappeared	1706.0654
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet	118.4685
the young man was opening the door of the stable	45.9688

half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken <UNK> which was fastened to alis finger	229.7951
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust	266.8228
there is the little door opening into the garden	94.5077
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé	3496.6685
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you yes fair lady replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is i myself but this castle then is mine this chamber is yours i am then your prisoner nearly so but this is a frightful abuse of power no <UNK> words let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said	280.6438
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have <UNK> valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a <UNK> draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to <UNK> in your veins <UNK> exclaimed valentine	730.3693
half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death	251.2712

excuse me said dartagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him	120.4538

bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	55.6389
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	111.7916
is this the decanter you spoke of asked davrigny	719.9304
go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do	144.8253
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud	377.2608
athos as a diplomatist	190.0049
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak	72.7920
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	140.1647
the point of the sword had touched a <UNK> and glanced along the bone	561.2920
stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising you still owe me something i said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me a louis on account a louis on account for a fowl certainly and your excellency now owes me louis danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke	307.9364
it had not been used	45.7276
my name <UNK> but surely you are monsieur dartagnan and <UNK> cried the lieutenant	2101.9243
that of a lieutenant of musketeers dartagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to dartagnan to the great astonishment of the young man	86.2790
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him	59.4937
go upstairs she said to the doctor	108.6871
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets	220.7733
when i first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances	133.2609
why buy what one can take take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor	1502.5767
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as alberts prison and franz and the count followed him	91.4107

then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twentyfive years of age and whom he was leaving in his <UNK> deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	218.2793

the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and <UNK> in his valise and opening and <UNK> his purse but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near <UNK> him a fresh <UNK> of wine oil and <UNK> upon seeing this hotheaded youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before	561.5939
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk	161.2510
monsieur baptistin especially i could never get such a man as that	175.6983
an officer approached	209.1060
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant	185.5482
he did not take in the paper containing the <UNK> article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse	493.7410

why should i but still there are some signals only addressed to you certainly and do you understand them they are always the same and they mean _nothing new you have an <UNK> or <UNK> this is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ah yes thank you sir and what is it <UNK> you understand yes it asks if i am ready and you reply by the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my lefthand correspondent to prepare in his turn it is very ingenious said the count	233.1819
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you	41.3073
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police	87.1074
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	109.9047
oh sir planchet only touched the tips of the counts fingers	249.3603
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	118.0285
you refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	91.9573
you had begun to <UNK> my poor felton	2272.3462
m	nan
she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and <UNK> of morcerf	252.9122
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to <UNK> them in her memory when they should be spoken	125.6850
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an <UNK> of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools	325.6685
de tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair	111.7731
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a <UNK> smile	811.0432
porthos had been trying a new horse dartagnan was on guard at the louvre aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood and athos whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud found himself close at hand	221.6953
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone athos smiled	630.4372
impossible the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently	569.7503
noirtier fixed his eyes on her	30.3989
has the law any eyes to witness your grief	527.6019
i love you so tenderly that i cannot help being jealous even of the past a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	235.7235
i possess nearly livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saintméran will leave me as much and m	156.4630
i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said châteaurenaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels i had three similar ones returned monte cristo	416.5906
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is a forgery how can that be yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you but it is dartagnan that will come do not deceive yourself	118.3908
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone	67.7134
everyone looked at carlini the sheath at his belt was empty	163.2731
porthos seeing this <UNK> his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great <UNK> she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the <UNK> bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	528.2678
i hear she said that paris is not quiet	116.5155
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars	175.1631
let him follow me i will take him to his cell go said the gendarmes thrusting dantès forward	108.2157
hold continued dartagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and <UNK> by dust in exchange i have torn many skins	282.6228
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards	266.3341
no no cried the countess you must not leave me	36.7780
this reasoning seemed to dartagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight oclock in the evening the time when the <UNK> of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate	226.9796
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special <UNK> to make of them instruments of his vengeance so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again	219.2933
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box	268.8008
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville i had but one <UNK> and he died day before yesterday indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment	542.0546
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty	814.3569
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature <UNK> after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the <UNK> of his vision and once more awakened memory	570.9246
ha ha ha and a frightful <UNK> laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle	879.6930
bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master	144.6252
to paris first i have affairs to settle and they both set out for paris	228.1753
do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like glass that will not prevent me replied dartagnan if ever i find him in the meantime said tréville seek him <UNK> i have a right to advise you all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion	212.4088
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	399.1655
i did not even touch your hand and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord	252.7690
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon	206.1165
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand	64.6898
is it as hopeless as he thinks alas madame more hopeless than he thinks	475.9745
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos <UNK> idea cried porthos indeed my dear dartagnan i dont know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace raoul woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself i wouldnt give a farthing for his life they set out	181.5763
diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration i should have cried i should at this moment the tumult was heard nearer	130.8602
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing	99.4382
now said the steward what have you to tell me and you said andrea	43.1613
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you	87.2907
three days <UNK> long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones	256.8384
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain <UNK> hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france m valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	195.4081
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that <UNK> the famous sculptor had commenced	507.9563
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion	174.1263
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage	181.3225
never did funeral knell never did <UNK> produce a greater effect on the <UNK>	29116.5293
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	45.2091
in a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor it is he said villefort turning pale	322.3544
why is that gendarme there asked andrea of himself	323.6386
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	263.8083
but now answer me	368.0106
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	224.9489
he knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	267.0309
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal	318.0641
here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment	242.7819
a learned italian chapter	1381.2629
free to leave me leave you	78.6516
of course	816.6236
on the <UNK> the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on <UNK> was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice	1165.3394
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears	484.3217
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of <UNK> the count monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	315.2006
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	105.7156
a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared	114.8265
my dear franz m	86.5064
no by your eminence by me	171.0413
i have something to say to you certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck	326.0055
oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in love you know what it is to be in love said dartagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention	43.1940
while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via <UNK> which led directly between the <UNK> and rospoli palaces franzs attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant	319.2977
but what <UNK> her	196299.7188
of the important cities given up by henry iv	773.8848
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	61.5057
we shall see better what is going on and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you	57.4885
fire fire cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends	156.7672
i have been taught these two <UNK> in latin and in greek one is i believe from <UNK> and the other from bias	1805.0291
cavalcantis asked beauchamp	760.0909
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction an admirable subject cried the jesuit	495.9673
your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand go on then replied the count	78.6453
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps <UNK> frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which <UNK> of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orangetree one after another	1398.7328
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	198.8687
yes yes continued m	82.1851
he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust	3561.6816
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him	86.2902
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper	148.1095
davrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m	201.7120

bonacieux entered	170.5630

she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money	305.5167
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my <UNK> i am never paid by the <UNK> make the king five years older really and pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv	361.9930
but to you dartagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend	182.0687
at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the <UNK> tavern where all the languages of the known world were <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK>	887.3395
she turned toward the wall to <UNK> there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her	182.9207
he saw that it was a <UNK> war between <UNK> war to the death	3809.1599
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand <UNK> that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform you have evidently seen and observed everything let us proceed oh yes yes now as regards the second question i am listening was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès yes a young man who loved her and his name was fernand that is a spanish name i think he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the letter oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by	263.3979
sticking a knife into me that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no one not even to your mistress no not even to my betrothed then it is danglars i feel quite sure of it now wait a little	232.0546

same effect on men of the north as on men of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south and that is the case observed monte cristo	276.2025

on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement	538.7401
it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the <UNK> satisfaction of his own curiosity	466.0368

as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fête she was received by the city <UNK> and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy	161.1607
but no on reflection the procureur was not a <UNK> man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the <UNK> it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from <UNK> association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their soninlaw	647.0836
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory	101.6716

he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock struck	50.4747

so much the better come tell me his name remember that his name is all my secret yet i must know his name yes you must see what confidence i have in you you overwhelm me with joy	136.3089
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning	266.7061
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	132.7517
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from <UNK> over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	138.1798

de tréville had intimated to them his majestys fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may and they must immediately prepare their outfits	489.3960
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a <UNK> light without warmth	508.0570
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydée your <UNK> her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the counts voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo turned around haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement	260.7242
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but selflove but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs	262.1361
she is a <UNK> stranger	16377.1738
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo	277.7567
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian <UNK> is the worst in the world	151.1394
what could that mean	329.1112
de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king	61.9353
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven oclock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who <UNK> your torch from you	640.1737
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared	157.2561
then are your names gentlemen the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay said aramis	54.6406
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	128.2310
or rather at what he said and what was he saying he said this madame mazarin is a <UNK>	277.2173
on the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_ who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly	199.8595
it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination	171.5477
ah heavens if it were that but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort why not <UNK> scarcely know <UNK> it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it is it so	592.3979
as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor and i replied franz will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin	259.7922

madame said villefort i ask where is m	118.1946
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said dartagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what must see him whereon the balcony not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur dartagnan is right the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger	471.7136
we must never look for discretion in first love	366.0179
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter	118.2343
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a <UNK> in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of <UNK> compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven oclock talking of affairs of state	475.6638
he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m	257.3030
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy	155.3411
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your <UNK> who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he <UNK> defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied and now we understand each other when do you wish the carriage to be here in an hour in an hour it will be at the door	179.7707
an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival	137.0295
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you	100.5861
he would have <UNK> at this instant someone knocked at the door	343.6575
mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees	461.2067
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord dartagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside	93.3117
midnight struck	1257.7607
one of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a club	134.8066
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	232.5142

mother and son chapter	222.0869
noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron dépinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	197.2287

everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood	142.0210
instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any resistance	375.2521

and you did cry he asked	322.4933
but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true <UNK> is to say with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and <UNK> royalty of paris the <UNK> of <UNK> in other words of all normandy when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font madame de longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last	411.7680
two or three masks strove to knock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand but albert a firstrate <UNK> sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo	345.4479
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty	238.5829
ah i understand athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to <UNK> his <UNK> place by the name of chateau	478.8038
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle	546.0834
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	212.6967
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you	79.5288
he still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest	335.7159
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for <UNK> of that city known as the capital of the world	298.0267
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of <UNK> himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the <UNK> rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish <UNK>	773.1249
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father	255.1755
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly	252.5916
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers well no <UNK> is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow <UNK> nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child <UNK>	904.0557

one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly <UNK> lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m	321.3988
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the <UNK> danglars danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness	504.6863
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that dartagnan had not come to béthune	156.3109
what is he contriving asked aramis	1979.0291
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced <UNK> and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops	496.5331
pardon me my friend we will see about that presently said dartagnan with a slight smile	44.1793

it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed <UNK> and the bands of mendicants reappeared	561.4205

the count soon mastered the <UNK> the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious <UNK> we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with <UNK> and studded with <UNK>	575.7035
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and <UNK> his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent	529.3513
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price his excellency is not perhaps aware that m	118.7419

come said he to himself be a man	35.8499
really villefort you surprise me	801.8389
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m	246.7629
perhaps to madame de longueville	45.4541
but dartagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it	91.5882
stand on one side dartagnan stand on one side cried athos	154.5758
dantès was alone in darkness and in <UNK> as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead	585.2713
porthos was <UNK> over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	2840.3472
chapter	nan
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering m i said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	66.3047
andrea felt his heart leap with joy	303.8705
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted	234.1604
and you i shared the same fate at aquapendente do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention	246.7849
ah you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible	208.9896
that was all	23.0180
and i was ready to strangle you cried the duke	33.4051
m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred <UNK> his own yacht	674.6812
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may	144.3944
be true	566.9583
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without <UNK> the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely	95.6860
ah ah is that you dear friend exclaimed porthos	107.8360
the _pharaon_ the _pharaon_ said every voice	463.9568
the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt	191.1781
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none	100.9071
must we then asked anne of austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times mazarin smiled <UNK> at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal seriously	874.4389
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this since dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison	132.1885
dartagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face	40.0648
to the swords be it so replied dartagnan that is exactly what i want dartagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked <UNK> but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause	297.2855
<UNK> <UNK> according to your idea then my brain is turned	1131.4214
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces	966.5210
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace	963.8939
the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board _la jeune amélie_ having expired dantès took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to <UNK> him further	379.6425
come louise let us talk of our affairs	117.9899
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest <UNK> but what have i done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you	404.7140
there is still something else said he	73.5776
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly my faith monsieur that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days and me too said dartagnan	120.0536
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	544.2154
no one answered	133.1282
villefort approached noirtier	569.0680
the diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique <UNK> of <UNK> value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	919.0692
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their <UNK>	267.8600
flying through an army sire said athos in all countries in the world is called charging then i shall die sword in hand said charles	279.2854
what on earth can you have been saying to that <UNK> exclaimed porthos	660.0281
m who could know that i was here already said the young man	40.9152
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an <UNK> and <UNK> knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him	557.2906
ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor	345.8683
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal	349.8806
i thought you would never come in whats the matter now planchet demanded dartagnan	209.3116
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts	223.6249
she is gone said he she must have returned to the louvre you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out no replied bonacieux with a selfsufficient air she is too superficial a woman is the young guardsman at home i do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters all the same it is well to be certain how so by knocking at his door	113.5707
de villefort you have promised <UNK> you <UNK> to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our <UNK> my love said the marquise attend to your <UNK> your <UNK> and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand	625.5669
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks	199.2383
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	233.0561
he esteems me highly	23734.6855
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far	278.6649
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between us ingrate that you are ah i advise you to complain said porthos	493.5972
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a <UNK> ambition which might be easily aroused	560.6382
this will teach you said dartagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion god	943.7183
why watch me asked the duke uneasily	195.2835
i shall hear this morning that m	96.0950

the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through <UNK> of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the <UNK> monte cristo recognized him whom he sought	684.8364
diplomat or not i dont know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly	230.2161
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the <UNK> sounded the retreat	577.1647
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> music had been succeeded by painting foils <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a <UNK> education fencing <UNK> and <UNK> and it was here that he received <UNK> cooks and charles <UNK>	15455.5488
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand	161.3619

rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet	354.7935
nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind	131.1439
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun	198.4146
eh it was that that did the business after <UNK> heavily for twelve hours we sprung a <UNK>	2112.1846
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely <UNK>	1116.6899
pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true	84.3983
and now to table said athos	154.0831
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the <UNK> sheet of paper flung into the corner	217.6720
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of <UNK> doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	1438.5245
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive	112.3632
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous teresa gave him <UNK> instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his <UNK> from him was a lad of fifteen replied peppino	435.3677
de trévilles where he had dined	253.7637

my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are <UNK> in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with	219.5802
the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	759.1079
on approaching an <UNK> near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out whos there and dartagnan <UNK> first asked the word of the <UNK> and rocroy after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the <UNK>	3172.6504
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately	433.2225
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twentythree years of age said athos in a low tone	140.6463
the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind	352.5969
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others	157.3634
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the <UNK> did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success	3420.5481
the trial	1060.7960
come gentlemen cried harrison <UNK> of his illustrious captive let us be off where do we sleep colonel at thirsk replied harrison	1124.5126

endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the <UNK> intriguers he remained an honest man	2298.4038
i followed her i caught her i bound her and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother	746.9446
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_ who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly <UNK> with their own	397.2738
besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of m	202.9604
i am glad to see said dartagnan that you have still that honest lad with you he is my steward replied porthos he will never leave me	76.5831

porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos	172.4056
thank you she said	19.8943
the <UNK> of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	1032.6586

you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money	1401.8289
monte cristo smiled	20.4960
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	1067.3617
i tell you so by the faith of de tréville how so you will be assassinated and i shall die in the performance of my duty but your mission will not be accomplished that is true replied dartagnan	53.3455

mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him	190.5032

now suppose that next day one of these <UNK> or <UNK> or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table	2813.0691
well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count	100.3741
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	626.6166
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majestys principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of <UNK> political <UNK> was based upon sound and excellent principles	268.5806
what are you doing reverend sir	55.1630
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès	592.4681
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever	319.4361
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	265.0540
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the <UNK> behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	230.2668

dartagnan although he was not a musketeer performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality	212.3132
and i of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the barons card	209.7865
the two notaries were holding a <UNK> as to the best means of proceeding with the affair	351.0473
now as at the moment in which dartagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance	259.9980
with your lasso you could stop an ox again ali repeated his affirmative gesture	1111.8300
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet we went out	134.1216

at least dartagnan said to himself as he took the road to villarscotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking	73.7654
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	65.1524
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence	282.4456
thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame	596.4848
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead go sir count replied dartagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england	96.2337

the gardener nodded and began to <UNK> up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard	448.5099
he then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness	85.6951
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthoss nor aramiss and as to athos he had none	312.3551
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and <UNK> as a model of perfection	218.6869

maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and davrigny for a moment diverted from the <UNK> topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayhe is mad but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	407.6649
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm remain said caderousse	235.6844
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind	1052.9983

all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull <UNK> between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the <UNK> sublime spot a restingplace full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking	319.9059
<UNK> <UNK> said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up dartagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little and why dartagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis	122.7498
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy and died that must have cut short the projects of escape for the dead man yes replied m	282.7174

here monsieur mazarin is everything does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england oh no he is a subtle <UNK> italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament the queen shook her head despairingly	478.4300
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king	198.0899

planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used up	110.2160
dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone	535.1846
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and <UNK> without mercy or delay	1035.9061
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo _pardieu_ everyone exists doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely <UNK> an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses have you seen the greek mistress i have both seen and heard her	446.2612

then there is his son andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his fathers millions	190.4083
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready <UNK> as if waiting to start	302.5764
dartagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet <UNK> a meeting a gold chain or a diamond	521.0304
youll excuse me i know they exchanged bows and dartagnan returned to his companions	164.5482
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as confessor	2453.7791
but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire	72.2615

is it my fortune which you find insufficient	327.0066
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	432.6977
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	170.8495
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	127.8835
a loud cry could be heard by her	108.0217
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had <UNK> bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of <UNK> <UNK> they were those of science contained in the library and <UNK>	1579.0138

toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion	90.2500
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner	178.2250
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	150.1817
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church my dear bazin you ought to perceive said dartagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly changed in everything	185.6934
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking nevertheless or find some one else continued dartagnan turning his back	127.3466
let us be on our guard oh my dear dherblay who can say whether dartagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal	102.3732

she descended and went through the passage	68.4590
felton was sent away	138.9780
alas i have them no longer how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son well let us see said mazarin isnt there still time to repair the evil	258.3067

hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob	2220.5447

since my convalescence i have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that i am forced to regulate them a little	124.6280
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness	62.0449
a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible	101.5342
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward <UNK>	1570.9010
the curate related the incident to the count of sanfelice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month	224.7161
unfortunately he is more <UNK> than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and <UNK> i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone	167.3781
dartagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty <UNK> which offer consolation while they are hoped for	1175.2295

milady seized the occasion	360.5142
dartagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed quietly	173.0943
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten oclock	187.4545
it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first	32.0685
and to sign the contract in three days yes then in my turn i also say very well danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	88.2417
the drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the <UNK> hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture	4478.5381

well then <UNK> for me there and i will soon join you you leave me then yes i also have a pious visit to pay morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an <UNK> sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city	223.0103

sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m	842.0765
i will say do you think you are engaged with a <UNK> like yourself said bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that andrea was moved to the very soul	287.4216

you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview say no more of that madame said felton	106.8973
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health	122.5261
chapter xlvii	88.7212
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than dartagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a mans head inside the carriage	177.6669
one opposite to me the other with his back to me good	131.3256
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france	51.3661
to command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her	856.4073
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio	165.3742
should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it at once into money i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my fathers chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents and i should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me	404.6669
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirtyfive francs albert then took a pen and wrote <UNK>	1860.3416
your pardon my officer said athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good guard your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak	68.4750
the letters being finished each put his own into two <UNK> so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters	713.5057
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	4381.0977
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night	207.2962

faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it	226.0347
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the <UNK> of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of <UNK> when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	920.0794
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawingroom	39.7297

for the moment she wished nothing better	152.6761
dartagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished	290.8619
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable	509.8449
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected	55.8672
the riot	1989.0762
crushed and impoverished by <UNK> by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very <UNK> people as the <UNK> <UNK> described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by <UNK> they began to murmur	3515.4331

bonacieux with a halfsmile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience	245.4230
morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality	258.9280
is it from thee	266.4416
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box which box do you mean asked the countess	234.7029

felton cried she	99.5785
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	111.0188
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos	1683.2208
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace	723.5143
but i repeat to you i am charged with <UNK> it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen	92.8567
it was alas the ghost of former greatness	360.0397
you were saying my dear friend no i said nothing yes you were saying you wished to leave this place ah indeed the will was never wanting to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall tis <UNK> said so and i say it again and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldnt go a hundred steps without being <UNK> because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves that is true we should need clothes and arms well said dartagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better bah said porthos looking around	212.1010

one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory	396.5439
in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was marie michon said madame de chevreuse hastily	177.6895
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	214.0683
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	477.6114
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess <UNK>	8384.3447
what said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after another dartagnan felt the truth of this reproach	267.8284
read then for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to <UNK> those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause	177.9176
dartagnan said nothing but <UNK> his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake	800.7527
and you did not tell him that you came from me no sir at ten oclock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter	98.4878
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman	93.5380
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined	715.5807
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor	222.9792
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment	218.1280
the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation	149.8545
porthos had discovered the means _the <UNK>	5454.1636
now although la ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv	184.5044
what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	77.2793
how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation	103.3146
the monks had no longer an instant of repose	434.7570
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose <UNK> garments scarcely covered him	382.8990
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on <UNK>	676.6539
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and <UNK> organization and he had brought him away without any other recommendation	469.9407
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on	58.7837
guillotine	nan
there were nobles who made war against each other there was the king who made war against the cardinal there was spain which made war against the king	222.1378
what are these things he asked	44.4748
i have not forgotten all i owe thee	78.8427
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst yes added planchet like the famous ass of <UNK>	658.6520
i cannot answer for the queen	50.8188
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful	148.4374
father and son m	205.7675
it is true i fought with tolerable success i dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others dartagnan pretended astonishment	454.2151
well just as you like my prince theres liberty for all the world	174.2539
we have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him porthos is wounded then i cannot tell you monsieur what you cannot tell me	91.5102
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more and i tell you sir that you are mistaken	227.6360
is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied dartagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into <UNK> houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven then monsieur is satisfied asked planchet	141.6295
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness	207.9645
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features	169.8712
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage i do not think that is the case however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed	58.2649
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the <UNK> madame de villefort sighed her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet	569.5693
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night	175.8400
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner	142.3116
at two oclock the tennis balls began according to grimauds directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over	228.2604
for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian	216.8440
the valet ran directly	990.0625
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room	202.1249
oh i confess it is all the same to me oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your <UNK> and crimes would <UNK> for it what you talk of <UNK> madame messalina lady <UNK> either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your <UNK> against me my jailers and my <UNK> heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening	1204.4584
no one has seen dartagnan and porthos has not appeared	76.9181

but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son may i ask how much he allows the young man five thousand francs per month sixty thousand francs per year	106.2828
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old	464.0767
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twentyfour hours dartagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility	182.2083
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship	413.9578
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur dherblay	184.3566
dartagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose <UNK> mouth emitted sounds of distress	1794.5574
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all	122.5281
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood	410.7812
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced	192.5205
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandits dinner through the crevices of the <UNK> i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such <UNK> and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goatskin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy	327.2267
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased	144.6234
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling	807.9348
at ten oclock anne of austria had entered the kings room	32.2610
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven	1308.1980
and you asked porthos havent you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that <UNK> then is his name <UNK> i have found him again but he is lackey no longer what is he then with his sixteen hundred <UNK> remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de <UNK> has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards how does it happen then that he is in your service he has been guilty of certain <UNK> and fears he may be disturbed and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchets adventure	321.8681
he is a fine young man of fair <UNK> little too fair <UNK> in manners but you will see and judge for yourself by the way said the major you know i have only the francs which the abbé busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m	213.2710
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed	287.7639
he was eighteen only three years older than you are raoul when i saw him set to work <UNK> against tried men and did monsieur dartagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening eye	509.9835
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	226.3592
if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison	246.0925
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion	71.4358
both entered and found themselves in darkness but mme	315.0973
ah if i knew sblood messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this <UNK> at the <UNK> and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you i am sure of <UNK> would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step	547.4521
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow so tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back again	184.5641
dartagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with <UNK>	645.7949
and this is the reason monsieur continued maximilian of my sister and brotherinlaw having only francs a year maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the counts heart had swelled within him when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat	267.5399
when they entered the port it was already night	103.9484
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when dartagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing dartagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness	112.2084
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson	55.3806
then all was dark again	398.4121
if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me no signature	192.0551
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling	325.4869
during the first act the countess g entered	73.6663
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his eye was calm and even brilliant	169.3767
he wished to see everything	52.4074
for my part i declare dartagnan i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom dartagnan blushed	451.3770

however he remained standing clinging to a window	70.0467
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll	632.1216
dartagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as dartagnan	315.4810

grimaud is it thou grimaud signified that he was not mistaken	118.9164
yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one i will undertake to divert him replied the count	131.2679
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	427.8044
here i am at your eminences service as well as monsieur du vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of porthos porthos bowed to the cardinal	63.3251

those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache	62.1909
what do you mean beauchamp oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the ministers said beauchamp placing his eyeglass in his eye where he tried to make it remain	142.4349
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well theres nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos	100.6134
unlimited credit about two oclock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty <UNK> assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his <UNK> person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were <UNK> the armorial bearings of a baron and	512.6161
directed his groom to inquire at the porters lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within	122.4687

let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit monsieur dartagnan will enjoy our conversation better yes replied dartagnan i am fatigued with reading and all this latin <UNK> me certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon dartagnan a look full of gratitude	278.5006
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	75.3030
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold	15.7458
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner	131.9761
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results alas dear friend said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life	391.1054
he took to his heels and was soon at m	80.0911
and why did you refuse my son inquired the old man	43.5962
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it tomorrow raoul didnt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a <UNK> andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	517.6249
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed	218.8009
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted	115.4584
but my lieutenant said a soldier less <UNK> than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep what not asleep said felton what is she doing then she has fainted	300.7837
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness	450.1366
still in spite of this <UNK> politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself	394.6920
you recollect perfectly all i have told you do you not your eminence will judge the ball of madame the constable the night at the louvre the evening at amiens the arrest of montague the letter of madame de chevreuse thats it said the cardinal thats it	105.3562

this evening said the governor when the task was ended	75.1240
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name so he has but i like mine as well certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be <UNK> a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make <UNK> i prefer m	293.0476
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness	203.2079
half a million said he magnificent half a million is it said the major	100.2392
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	885.4337
it will be even more difficult to descend dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	172.1236
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to dartagnan and a wellknown voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening planchet cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	152.4193
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	166.8383

besides it doesnt concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon ah that is true said athos	230.0018

a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	83.6959
may i be permitted to inform my wife said he	60.4243

the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least	67.4780

porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger	326.5063
morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass	308.1589
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia	233.2450
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh	207.1562
let us separate and let us seek the mercers <UNK> is the key of the intrigue a woman of such inferior condition can you believe so said porthos protruding his lips with contempt	220.7305
the daughter of ali pasha of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki and your slave _ma foi_ yes but how did she become so why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople wonderful really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream	248.8916
the place royale	1136.3989

every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations	725.0560
the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the <UNK>	459.8417

morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of <UNK> to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	205.2159
as for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him	83.7573
you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand <UNK> matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter	312.1727
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared	348.8955

what monseigneur said dartagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself	87.9726
he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally <UNK> but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment	1368.3999

de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables comminges glanced at dartagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up	174.1175

the latter seemed to be <UNK> in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria	214.5330
one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying	94.3676
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	102.0381
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness	240.2534
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered dartagnan	47.3937
noirtier gave his assent	301.2295

cardinal mazarin said he	72.8989
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him	159.6555
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report	532.7971

athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room	40.7225
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before <UNK> letters of unlimited credit i can be no longer <UNK> but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded	398.0792
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos	79.2632
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	155.0360

eleven oclock sounded	203.6484
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m	76.5849
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	191.0123
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do	289.7563

now pass your arm through this opening why you will know <UNK> it porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	367.2601
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressinggown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames	79.5049
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but i know he must be so at present we thought so too monsieur	132.6762
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m	33.7297
you know there are different sorts that tall <UNK> man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a <UNK> more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the <UNK>	1264.7601
but continued m	250.6117
oh pray do for heavens sake tell us all <UNK> he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly <UNK> person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving	432.3221
by whom did the queen send you this jewel she gave it to me herself where in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet how giving me her hand to kiss you have kissed the queens hand said m	170.5184
the contract shall not be signed cried morrel	120.7556
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried	1988.3943
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	137.8641
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the <UNK> with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance	301.6767
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground pistache my friend jump for the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina the dog turned his back to the cane	198.0283
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous <UNK> which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose	1201.1833
the devil exclaimed porthos theres vulcan foundered zounds cried dartagnan then we must stop give me your horse porthos	682.9376
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	713.6282
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh	1203.4291
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson <UNK>	1301.2780
it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head	256.6491
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy	262.8180
the shade of richelieu was mazarin	225.9836
goodmorning my dear host cried dartagnan	26.1770

yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	113.3034
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated	105.9727

this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in	108.2412
what is to be said	32.9974
dartagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself	214.1858

franz <UNK> she shall marry him valentine sank weeping into a chair	1209.4915
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the <UNK> land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor	241.9775
bertuccio said he	21.4564
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back	163.9622
go sir go but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it	118.0924
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaunt yes they would have all been blown up just so	199.0776
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love	508.7006
dartagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down	198.6640
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha	85.6639
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	963.5938

bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	63.6831
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me	243.5646
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep	81.5942
the duke counted two stories	1059.3357
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two is monsieur aramis with dartagnan asked lord de winter	283.0064
overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even <UNK> live count i have your word said morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added it is halfpast eleven morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours and he arose	196.1719
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer	89.8723
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low <UNK> trees which looked like <UNK> <UNK> crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	2374.0049
chapter xlvi	342512.1562
farewell he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	45.0942
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him come now aramis said dartagnan you must be taking me for some one else nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence havent i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman	114.2333
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	132.1749
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand <UNK> who will make you pay dearly for my death grimaud hesitated	192.0492
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me i pardon you monseigneur said bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry	284.8936

with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud	242.3342
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of <UNK> and the <UNK> king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air _à <UNK> and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their <UNK> treasures	7054.5112
alas murmured edmond can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open	203.9367
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont	827.6961
to the sheets said he	246.6866
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible	284.7323
ah the young <UNK> in a <UNK> does not know where that may lead him to certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and <UNK> of the delinquent of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant	319.5392
have you proof of this i had it and you have lost it how stupid yes but by careful search it might be recovered really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me and the count humming an air from <UNK> went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts	325.5980

the queen was in the midst of her <UNK>	212.7648
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink	102.8471
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him	205.9310
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had <UNK> the abbé adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guineapigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit	901.7467
at the extremity of the wood dartagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle	59.4658
mazarin bowed	303.5825
athos lend me grimaud who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked up a little english and can act as my interpreter go grimaud said athos	237.8569
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women	1420.2448
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound	93.5807

after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room	70.6092
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous <UNK> of the guides	494.8221

passing alongside one of them dartagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of <UNK> same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom dartagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her	224.4882

the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	210.3483
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to pistache let us go on to another of his exercises <UNK> was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed <UNK> you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the <UNK> of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs	269.7747

there only remained three things to <UNK> they should write to miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	249.2960
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that dartagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	142.9384
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear	55.4340

the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming <UNK> bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly <UNK> in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind	1047.8438

the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them	142.6395
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting	288.6163

kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh	46.1573

the young counts conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	482.2111
the young girl smiled	34.6019

wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was dartagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	181.8970
presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault	249.0688
they had only halberds before now they have muskets	1073.2451
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos	180.8309
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent	213.8966
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness	1134.2416

the king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain he read it rapidly	110.6787
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act	1076.4022
it was ten oclock when they arrived	40.8496
and why if you knew me do you let me die because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal	116.8921
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	186.4290
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish	796.2032
since my brothers assassination in the streets of nîmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard	120.8813
wait a week and i myself will give you some a week is too long	129.6817

it is impossible that your majesty can make all this <UNK> about a letter written to my brother the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête	111.7977
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing	711.5667
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it	69.7014

as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master	158.1332
franz fell powerless on a chair villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man	99.3166
besides we will have no words about it	63.1836
i tied my lantern to a <UNK> branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole	505.5951
the noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern	316.8635

dartagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friends house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni	121.4038
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem	217.5069
my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something <UNK> gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like a <UNK> <UNK> a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	243.0461

dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in <UNK> <UNK> pictures	822.9472

the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water	216.4568
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer	255.8732
ah sir he exclaimed it was you without you i was a dead <UNK> dead but one recovers sir as you perceive replied raoul and we have but had a little bath oh sir what gratitude i feel exclaimed the man with gray hair	348.5904
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but <UNK> he was deeply wounded and his selflove immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	460.6328
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce <UNK> your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received	181.9777

the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together	214.8357
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note <UNK> can be done he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the <UNK> is to say was in villeforts handwriting	753.6147
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it	146.5831
oh sir exclaimed m	64.9630
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa that was an <UNK> certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera	406.9663

these men are going to behead your father	179.4602
edmond had one friend only and thus it cannot be divided	390.9349
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened	368.6562

i have seen <UNK> devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm <UNK> to this <UNK> <UNK> of poison certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it oh very easily	550.4122
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state dartagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos	261.7237
the two friends repaired to athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them	240.7979
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve i understand said athos smiling midnight about that time but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return if you do not return how does it concern you	197.2022
dartagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him	452.0291
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend	384.4085
tell me then speak you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness who are you then	249.9733
i have a letter to give you from the count from the count murmured the two young people	42.0294
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip	151.8295
this must be then an affair of importance and what is the most important affair to a woman of twentyfive love	134.0419
villefort became pale he understood the old mans meaning	94.3098
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the <UNK> of the dunes repeated	1277.4745
italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head	302.2129
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully equipped	516.3793
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	193.3457
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you ah said buckingham god be praised my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger laporte burst into tears	191.6041
behind this wall	276.1052
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been <UNK>	327.4179
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey	411.6334
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him then continued châteaurenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champsélysées you only want a mistress albert smiled	242.1611
i have the price and dartagnan threw the bag upon the table	58.7830
you who have chateau meadows mountains <UNK> who have forty thousand francs a <UNK> my dear friend all those things i have but i am a <UNK> in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by <UNK> with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	1114.7910
what do i see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans	52.5268
you do not believe me m	26.2716
we shall require it yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for <UNK> badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	301.9551
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least <UNK> of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken	211.2674
at seven oclock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night	102.8193
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost to die whilst doing a good deed it is impossible	137.3666
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands	264.0772
i have heard that name in greece in <UNK> with the affairs of ali pasha exactly so this is the mystery said danglars	278.2524
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully <UNK> that he had	266.4879
the two friends mounted as did their servants	191.0183
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful	352.7513
i have arrived from <UNK> this morning	833.6395
then dartagnan became almost wild	573.8149
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune	55.1912
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere very good thought dartagnan tis our road likewise we will go together all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones	228.0709
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison	546.1367
mousqueton trembled in all his members	207.4934
remember if you talk if you <UNK> if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you	350.2936
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur <UNK> another time at my own house in the country in my château <UNK> i had a château a third time at monsieur de trévilles where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman	265.0786
but one of these balls launched by porthos <UNK> hand passed so close to dartagnans face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king	196.5510
it is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with dartagnan who most probably will be <UNK> man will you have done said the king	218.3696
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a <UNK> a foot and a half in <UNK>	358.5565
then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	231.9852
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me	246.7595
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me m right dantès quite right	138.6110
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered posthorses at noon	684.0320
this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them	85.2276
<UNK> least not as concerns m	1357.9181
i am choking oh my heart ah my <UNK> what <UNK> i suffer like this long no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy man	461.6789
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos	124.1426
<UNK> something but example more	1109.6838
de morcerf as the officer fernand <UNK> i do cried haydée	1807.5131
edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it <UNK> him with their spray	1099.0087
cavalcanti give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your <UNK> course i immediately counted him over the forty banknotes monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent	298.6858
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end	143.2263
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	944.1657
they were said however to be of good extraction	294.8555
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf	387.8377
since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles that is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste	932.9474
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m	80.7434
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours my lord said dartagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i cannot miss do not be uneasy said mazarin it is the same good thought dartagnan i fancied it was so return then at five oclock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you	78.3612
joannes _ma foi_ said the jeweller <UNK> with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight	385.5079
he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless	2127.8179
m	nan
mazarin replied dartagnan bursting into a laugh	157.5061
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a cry	70.7931
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious	162.1746
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul morrel smiled sadly	201.6167
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbés dead body	579.2095
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of <UNK>	89.0778
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	95.3654
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper	89.4771
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily	387.3744
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation <UNK> toward the cardinal	677.6349
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the crossroads	192.6685
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but <UNK> was hermetically sealed	1018.7834
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise	76.6437
<UNK> of course the son of an illfated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the <UNK> of that time pretended to distinguish those who were <UNK> to a violent and unhappy deaththe <UNK> <UNK>	2062.6538
yes cut the cable then athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord	139.0775
gracious heaven we are hesitating cried dartagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do i do not hesitate you know said grimaud	144.4308
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property no unfortunately but when i do obtain it well i shall remember old friends i can tell you that yes since you have such a good memory what do you want	113.5089
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	192.1045
blacas remain ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by <UNK> <UNK> fortune is made will it be long first muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackneycoach	701.3457
it was porthos	156.1442
chapter	nan
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow	476.8027
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	519.3063
yes her hand exclaimed everyone	1287.0336
they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little <UNK> containing his letter of credit for francs	670.2162
there are hours which last a year	847.5349
it must have been for his hide for _certes_ the carcass is not worth eighteen livres	726.9968
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos	160.4264
de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man	87.8648
when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid	148.0466
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now athos come athos was about to retire	198.7773
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten	192.7590
how can i understand	48.9803
why should my father <UNK> the <UNK> before whom others were accustomed to <UNK> who had taken for his device they hate me then they fear me it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect	600.4185
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman however that may be dartagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his <UNK> love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	224.4878
is this carriage for me said dantès	82.8078
i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths	225.0813
who are you madame said the count to the veiled woman	66.4674
the count advanced to meet him	27.9258
on this paved yard are to be <UNK> to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many <UNK> men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is <UNK>	4190.6875
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron <UNK>	359.6423
sinbad the sailor he said	48.8143
eh	nan
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can <UNK> such testimony sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved methat i have given nothing to that gallant officer dartagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	176.1573
dartagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands	328.1652
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here ah this is too much cried buckingham making a step toward the door	98.0745
the count again refused	557.2581
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons welfare	158.3200
de morcerf said baptistin as if that name sufficed for his excuse	200.5970
yes a base coward murmured dartagnan but <UNK> was very beautiful what _she_ demanded the host	1637.0951
are you making a sketch after <UNK> oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort	638.4026
and they went out together	113.1937
in the course of his mornings walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him	190.8475
yes these three <UNK> had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation	2008.8335
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m	652.5205
dantès read it	159.9278
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly	66.3727
and as to this book added she pointing to the <UNK> with her finger but without touching it as if she must be <UNK> by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de <UNK> accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his <UNK> felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively	403.4119
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m	237.4753
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence the jury took their seats m	172.0892
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence	215.5707
better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we cannot retreat without shame	623.4680
ho friend cried planchet	205.5134
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an <UNK> on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self this is no <UNK> it is all reality in order to believe it	315.7439
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy	312.2793
let us be open with each other and sincere what cried the gascon do you think athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis no answered athos embrace me my son zounds said porthos sobbing i believe im crying but how foolish all this is then they embraced	234.9534
he put out his hand to remove the object it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning	174.9395
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way thats true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man	118.3437
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror	737.9180
beyond portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars <UNK> by the winter bent with each breath of the wind	643.9606
<UNK> on one side of her head she had a small cap of <UNK> silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue	300.7501
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead	103.0889
do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed	174.3429
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a <UNK> of <UNK> rose and advanced a few steps toward him	365.8761
in <UNK> me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	1714.5167
and could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it	287.2478
he seems <UNK> said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee	1760.3778
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and reentered the house	109.8829
how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars	172.5943
felton barred his passage	1682.1593
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events	650.0760
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	178.0933
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break <UNK> and bear him off into the centre of the storm	269.8700
and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you nay perhaps you will even have a double reward i madame i cried felton	289.8745
it is only five minutes past eight said he to morrel there is not much time lost yet oh i made no allusion of that kind replied morrel	203.9811
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his <UNK> atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	785.4280
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon	333.5552
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the <UNK> weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell	358.8521
this last reason appeared convincing	2899.9475
let us go on	10.6699
deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week sir said franz i have one request to make what is it i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de châteaurenaud to be present at this signature you know they are my witnesses half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall you send i prefer going sir i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready franz bowed and left the room	140.3312
yes it was a prison for i tried in vain to get out of it	59.4447
dartagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend i dont like people to <UNK> me sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please dartagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	187.8253
beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m	120.2405
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one	129.3203
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window	219.8101
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been <UNK> by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul	195.3795
her <UNK> is to say madame de <UNK> mademoiselle de <UNK> madame de motteville and <UNK> her sister so called on account of her <UNK> just brought into her dressingroom the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	1107.7150
chapter lxv	85.1752
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous	513.5666
i can assure you the <UNK> made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	176.0088
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness	98.1471
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be <UNK> i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the <UNK> of the testament	678.9431
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge	231.4807
i feel myself drawn toward youi who have never loved anyone but my <UNK> who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men	863.0365
when i am convinced that the statement is false what the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamps last remark	490.6725
morrel and strong in the <UNK> which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him	952.9477
oh no athos	180.0811
yes just so	604.5231
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn	522.4126
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	74.9185
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors	178.7559
benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands they are ready to open for <UNK> use of them	638.5479
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion	265.6328
my dear count cried morcerf you are at <UNK> one of the most formidable <UNK> i <UNK> you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an <UNK> you are a philanthropist	893.6173
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a <UNK> daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m	923.4802
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt	160.4924
bonacieux hesitated to continue	219.6516
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he <UNK> then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said milady perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future well here for example said richelieu when in for a cause similar to that which moves the duke king henry iv of glorious memory was about at the same time to <UNK> flanders and italy in order to attack austria on both sides	366.7445
do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing	142.4878
yes and now i shall be more calm you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling	50.5787
dartagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword	259.2702

the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women	84.1583
thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice	133.5632
there was a great deal going on that morning and many <UNK> persons at the palais <UNK> persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	695.9515
he watched the effect of this question on the old man	101.7822
what are my commands said the queen	30.9008
in fact at one of the doors which opened into the queens apartment appeared the pretty mme	110.9659
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces	132.7536
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based	14701.7275
then steer for monte cristo the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island	153.8002
you know what athos told you the other day you eat at everybodys <UNK>	701.6758
really that <UNK> daubigne is very charming so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleepingroom and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished	747.1498
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants we have forgotten to mention that the counts coachman was attired in a <UNK> exactly resembling <UNK> in _the bear and the <UNK> and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green <UNK> with spring masks with which they made <UNK> at everyone who passed	1876.0599

chapter lxxvii	241.2313
will that do yes what are you looking at i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that one would say you were carrying me off and they would be right _pardieu_ oh i think you swore eugénie and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	218.8272
these are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has <UNK> a silver tower which are my mothers	419.1203
i am <UNK> a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when she <UNK> hold your tongue woman it is the will of god and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance	379.7817
are we not their majesties servants at that moment porthos entered	310.3807
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	481.4839
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied	324.7230
oh cried aramis do you see count yes said athos	37.8367
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhapsperhaps for even more than those but having sinned myselfit may be more deeply than <UNK> never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellowcreatures and found out their weaknesses	870.7325
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the <UNK> which his guest made was perfectly just	481.6428
indeed i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of paris	394.7138
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition what that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me dont dream it athos	151.5735
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening	369.1901
de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance	96.7719
m it was the end of september the wind blew violently	149.6501
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	475.8086
and you my friend there is a <UNK> for your trouble you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him	136.0267
speak on they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent which of the two denounced him	826.8792
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing what is that madame money mme	224.4172
alas said athos we depart alone yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation we are not yet at our destination observed the prudent dartagnan beware of misadventure ah my friend cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad <UNK>	487.2505
he therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke himself	153.4810
say no more about it _peste_ you come to your <UNK> quickly	877.3542
we know him said athos he never left the king yes that is he	50.3947
do you think you have to do with galleyslaves or novices in the world	347.8062
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal	164.8761
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	124.0478
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people cannot put up with	681.9337
i now believe in italian <UNK> below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> della <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> piastre non <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> il <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> di <UNK>	1859742.1250
the little boat bounded over the waves like a <UNK>	864.6653
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of spahis cannot risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world you see my position madame said morrel bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo	165.9578
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town	139.8227
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience anne colored slightly	616.2893
spanish policy and austrian policy would have their <UNK> in the cabinet of the louvre where they had as yet but partisans and he richelieuthe french minister the national <UNK> be ruined	5388.6318
is supper ready signor pastrini yes your excellency well then let us sup but the carriage and horses said franz	223.4697
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars	169.1322
to nobody in the world not even to athos or porthos i have not breathed a syllable to them good enough tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with dartagnan and both soon arrived at athoss dwelling	276.3441
well i selected the <UNK> of the heads of these <UNK> and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday friday and saturday as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief	1240.9333
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that dartagnan heard her in the antechamber	116.5962
however he like cæsar borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard	294.8379
fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around him	2338.4087
i should <UNK> the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was <UNK> yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang youat which i should be most unhappy certainly and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny	560.0314
i held the horses my hands were full your honor a shot was fired that moment mousqueton shrieked with pain	809.1536
i had been <UNK> by a <UNK> who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile	305.6334
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	220.4890
the castle of bragelonne	192.5520
noirtier made a sign that it did	28.6579
i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but <UNK> a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do but who then was this man asked felton	136.4484
i cannot explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them	113.7400
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief	141.6967
after a moments interval cocles appeared	443.3772
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you	46.6181
have you a heart	92.6227
cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said morrel	190.3155
raoul has no fortune other than i possess poor child and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my name and <UNK> shall you do with him i leave him with you my friend	136.8824
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep	481.8176
baptistin	nan
but presently the <UNK> face suddenly brightened	38901.2930
twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch	1431.4910
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak	165.1782
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	365.6110
yes keep <UNK> it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures	418.5730
are you going really that is a good <UNK> hours have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going	263.0655
well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	191.8413
locusta and <UNK> living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of the roman empire sullied by so many crimes	508.6225
de saintmérans house did it belong to m	145.9852
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony	425.3790
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss	107.7869
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four <UNK> was prepared for m	687.6722
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table	71.4554
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that <UNK> the devil are their <UNK> and porthos dartagnan and porthos ah yes	266.4232
go away he said	46.6008
for pitys sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was <UNK> pitys sake do not call assistance save mei will not harm you andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies	1189.0288
davrigny smiled sadly	497.9641
he has he is an abbé ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan	401.8631
porthos maintained a majestic silence	1530.4729
a few minutes after twelve oclock bernouin knocked at the queens bedroom door having come by the cardinals secret corridor	241.9254
this mystery required an explanation at least so dartagnan declared to himself	321.1859
dartagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying no sir i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look <UNK> then look replied dartagnan	144.0981
dartagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened	92.0113
this time we were the <UNK> so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms	1024.3453
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly	63.4858
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem	803.2936
andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari	189.2354
during this passage felton related everything to <UNK> instead of going to london he had <UNK> the little vessel how he had returned how he had <UNK> the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him <UNK> and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder	640.4415
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to <UNK> the scene	507.8395
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river	247.2296
yes to a convent and to which i dont know the secret has been well kept but _i_ will know and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	154.0402
de tréville crying to the rescue musketeers to the rescue as usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their comrades	218.6429
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but <UNK> the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially	418.0783
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim oh no monsieur dartagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you eh egad love me too i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and a hearty frondist too but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse i should say you could and the coadjutor and madame de longueville and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks well sir i will obey you although i do	155.3995
not understand you it is unnecessary for you to understand	101.0772
and now when are we to go asked athos	132.9144
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear	209.5755
ah said dartagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	280.9468
the several members of that group were much excited	592.3364
gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and <UNK> the jests of <UNK> the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie	502.2529
take courage vasiliki said he today arrives the <UNK> of the master and my fate will be decided	586.0770
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night there	403.0287
m rise said he	294.3047
poor fellow poor young man and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and <UNK> for you he did and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter yes and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier yes why you poor <UNK> simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed	451.9529
but now we are <UNK> it is immaterial to <UNK> are we going into normandy if you like delightful shall we be quite retired	1192.4020
the cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in italy	186.3817
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box	75.5380
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite corrupt	671.8871
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_ but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous <UNK> is not even addressed to you but to the kings attorney m true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise	271.5049
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it but dartagnan was still in a desponding mood	122.2872
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand	495.8900
a short time before they reached the baths of <UNK> the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz alighted	261.9101
ah im ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by <UNK>	531.9279
i like to hear you speak thus and i <UNK> well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl	277.1647
dartagnan and athos refused them	351.4385
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger	92.6305
but dartagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	231.6720
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a <UNK> sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	270.7369
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad	863.5383
de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	77.5341
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us	179.1280
the guards were under arms and dartagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades	50.1306
well said the president your name i cannot tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my fathers and can tell it to you a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand	141.9883
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon	271.9393
ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me i wish my lord would make me one promise what speak tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught theres every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to <UNK> true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest now resumed grimaud ive only one thing more to <UNK> your highness will continue to detest me ill try said the duke	296.9122
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villeforts bedroom	260.2283
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her the young and <UNK> officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath	299.1526
eh	nan
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m	220.8258
they ask my age i tell it	181.9866
m i awoke as the clock was striking six	200.2337
at them echoed de guiche	2254.0906
dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it	138.6354
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie	193.6099
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine yes and for a considerable sum what is the amount asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm	165.4725
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there	66.8651
oh my god cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell	89.2676
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy cold	314.4760
noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	382.1505
madame he said i am an abbé it is true but i am so against my will	53.7177
this <UNK> <UNK> the accuracy of the aim	31280.5527
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not <UNK> the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	113.9772
how many shots a hundred thats quite as many as we shall want	395.9880
through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all but true parisian as he was bonacieux could recognize every street by the <UNK> the signs and the lamps	657.7838
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st cloud opposite destréess pavilion	600.5966
well as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn or at least a cardinal	135.6763
listen my dear girl said dartagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or other	130.1807
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	129.7823
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself	370.2809
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting	1052.5059
i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the <UNK> said he well done said the englishman	267.5918
no said villefort fetch the nearest the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbé who lives next door to you	690.8060
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone	197.3676
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill	212.9079
i shall not go why asked porthos	86.3315
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me no not if thou dost not oppose my flight but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place you are determined to leave the chateau by heaven and earth this night i am determined to be free and if i defend myself or call or cry out i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman at this moment the clock struck	93.5141
i accept	1485.7057
good he said nothing almost <UNK> nothing more two in the arm and one in the breast	364.6323
may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you no no said noirtiers look	83.4595
this is the point of departure it is a <UNK>	263.5154
he became curious to solve the problem	1247.7045
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit <UNK> him as breath <UNK> the body and m	600.3776
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling	228.6744
had morrel been a more quicksighted man or better <UNK> in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department	339.2093
oh this is torture to me cried athos	68.7968
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed	138.3263
de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	221.9698
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness	601.7751
he stepped forward	587.6119
do you know monsieur dartagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen	64.3669
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort	449.1396
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy	1832.6205
chapter <UNK>	2393341.2500
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the <UNK> he trod so softly that no sound was <UNK> poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it	691.2228
villefort	nan
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles and from fromelles she had set out for armentières	635.7025
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish satan bowed his head and groaned	235.1313
that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil and came to my estate bracieux	564.1104
two shots were fired at once one by dartagnan the other by the adversary of porthos	138.0550
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	286.8527
the duke was at windsor hunting with the king	212.3736
that is lucky said blaisois	127.0618
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed	170.6129
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	121.8588
alls well he cried as he entered i have hired a <UNK> <UNK> as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow	1563.9493
baron send for the minister of war	92.9457
approach sir said the cardinal	19.6582
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has said	182.4111
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his fathers right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either	149.1593
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	109.8036
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it it is much more convenient at <UNK> anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or <UNK> like us ever do travel	403.1723
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	229.3300
de villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the <UNK> man	250.9390
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii	66.3249
who is that man he asked	67.8060
bonacieux the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him	180.7691
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most <UNK> cabbage for instance	40398.6680
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door	154.5327
i cannot stay here any longer with all my heart replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable	313.3692
dartagnan looked much disconcerted	3621.3357
we must proceed in an <UNK> manner hush said grimaud he is coming out	553.2567
m	nan
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckinghams assassination	179.6658
one day when the king had halted to fly the <UNK> and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting	110.3772
i am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queens	255.3567
toward midday lord de winter entered	188.3336
athos said a word to one of the <UNK> who bowed and proceeded toward the <UNK>	600.3658
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly	199.9689
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected <UNK>	330.5527
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her _lorgnette_ at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron drew a smile to franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him	239.5131
you know noirmont do you not	127.8798
the nobles and ladies of their majesties <UNK> were to dress two by two in chambers prepared for the purpose	1928.5812
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper	553.0784

many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations	370.3720
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart	161.0430

ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say dartagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question	84.0272

the rencontre	4076.4297
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another	291.3097
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but dartagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kittys apartment	193.8142
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed	141.0784
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion <UNK> his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the <UNK> by an outward flight of steps	523.4080
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of <UNK>	806.9772
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back	166.7113

it was that of a man from five to <UNK> in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy <UNK> that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries	371.5270
de villefort all i seek is happiness valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks	561.6649
fernands paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars	353.7446
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos	45.0351
he struck thrice	8174.6792

chapter xxxix	235.4798
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie	372.7452
he has followed us several times as i think when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness	126.7462
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy	182.8985
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne cried the former musketeer	570.2343
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a <UNK> <UNK> dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in <UNK>	705.4130
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to <UNK> by his splendid dress	407.8296
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in himhe is <UNK> and stupid porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew dartagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose	335.7367
one evening he cast off the <UNK> of a <UNK> from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the <UNK> the island of elba the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at portoferrajo	446.3815
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent <UNK> as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants	200.3256
men were giants in those times said athos now we are <UNK> in comparison	546.3227
no be assured i am not mad	87.9419

his companions followed his example	195.2129
marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to vendin leaving the duc de chatillon to await and bring on the rest	204.8981
they could willingly have strangled m	782.6479
with a word dartagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palaiscardinal	178.9345
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads rochefort and dartagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye	275.7982
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before	104.4101

albert de morcerf still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti the <UNK> my dear count said danglars you are a man of the world are you not i think so and you understand heraldry a little well look at my coatofarms it is worth more than morcerfs why so because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars well what then while his name is not morcerf <UNK> morcerf not the least in the world go on i have been made a baron so that i actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all impossible listen my dear count m	183.6679
you are right duchess	280.2165
i do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind the man looked at the banknotes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the <UNK> and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs	181.0733
all day he toiled on <UNK> and by the evening he had succeeded in <UNK> ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone	953.6909
all this she owes to dartagnan without doubt	265.5576
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them	77.1035
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the <UNK> point	795.0582
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	156.1571
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters	405.0663
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if athos <UNK> us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck at villarscotterets he wrote to the cardinal my lordi have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men	359.0034
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them	7113.6855
let us consider first the ancient rights	770.9677
at about a league and a half from the city dartagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time	183.6546
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise what a strange man you are what next	366.7592
the bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges	628.9365
it was almost broad daylight	1566.4458
freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms _to his eminence monseigneur the cardinal richelieu in his camp before la <UNK>	530.7378
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him	60.0439
the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful bernouin a cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm	535.7954
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church	225.0158
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the <UNK> of the town that charles i	419.1978
put back that weapon dartagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	355.5159
no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her	150.6666
besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience you see it is not my fault and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two <UNK> fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a <UNK>	776.7655
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes	256.0867
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch	350.2025
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire horrible cried de winter the daughter of henry iv and the wife of king charles wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle dorleans was spoken of said de winter	188.7822
here is an order for two hundred pistoles call upon my treasurer and get the money	305.5033
madame danglars had started when villefort on the counts invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own	172.3353
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m	147.3162
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you i must try and persuade m	146.6277
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	373.5591
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security	181.6270
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	187.7082
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys lackeys grumbled the cardinal	488.6195
haydées only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girls picturesque attitude and appearance	350.8197
but dartagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him	110.1945
and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him	767.6467
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard	87.3925
you have a sad air alas said dartagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate tell me presently said dartagnan	107.6733
i also was married at the deathbed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account still that idea of death madame said villefort	103.1785
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	348.2692
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder	234.4135
<UNK> truly guilty the truly guilty said milady is the <UNK> of england the persecutor of true believers the base ravisher of the honor of so many <UNK> who to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart is about to make england shed so much blood who protects the protestants today and will betray them tomorrow buckingham it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement	875.0688
those fellows strike hard and dont leave off in a hurry	510.2666
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself	313.0628
en route gentlemen and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris	742.5217
the kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism	469.3879
she wouldnt believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb	193.7238
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall	128.7995
at last he sank	184.7558
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	147.9482
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger	456.0376
what was the matter with you baron dartagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal	48.8529
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort	101.9828
this is what i propose to do said athos	36.0144
he placed the young girl again on the <UNK> lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole <UNK> remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	429.7238
i ask for it without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm	84.5087
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it	447.3894

these are doubtless your family arms	810.8097
yes that is my name you said then by the word of bonacieux	73.2221
milady was wrong in fearing that mme	221.5061
and why not demanded dartagnan	246.4003
what can it mean said debray to franz	87.7979
this was the abbé scarron always laughing joking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nervously with a small switch	38591.6445
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more <UNK> wound made by a woman the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself	663.6213
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend	224.3785

begone begone at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed dartagnan out of the room	51.6086
these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert he felt his heart beat and taking his mothers hand within his own he said tenderly yes you will live i shall <UNK> you will not leave me albert mother i must go said albert in a firm calm voice you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you besides i have signed m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven not my own wish mother but <UNK>	226.1862
olivain said athos showing the servant raouls <UNK> tighten the <UNK> of the sword it falls too low	29576.4883
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged	373.8846
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on	211.1165
come dont look so angry and you shall have francs of the money to do what you like with and eugénie shall have	148.9408

how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first	244.1336
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme	107.8708
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of <UNK> of prisoners made up of thieves <UNK> and murderers	2518.0540
adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away	340.5515
m	nan

as he gained the top of the rue <UNK> he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him	321.6361
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other	316.6886
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it	66.1858
however what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that subject with pleasure replied dartagnan i must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life how go into harness again <UNK> on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside ah hang it said porthos	285.4159
i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you and who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration	87.9258

i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged	211.1741
no i dont want your help watch the cardinal i am watching said porthos	167.1440
the prince read as he hastened on	185.2282
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry	61.3465
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers what matters it if you avoid them hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold i positively refuse intrigues terrify me	460.3889
supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the <UNK> i cannot see much that is left unless they eat one another poor fools said athos emptying a glass of excellent bordeaux wine which without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys merited it no less poor fools as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all <UNK> all the same resumed he after having <UNK> his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows but what the devil are you about aramis continued athos	534.1722
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me	1701.2643

we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere	180.3186
excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m	30.9006
whereupon grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	160.0327
the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to <UNK> her punishment to <UNK> the duke put his pen to the paper	759.6235
it is for me to give orders here and not you monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you i want none it was a temporary indisposition	157.7487
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up true monsieur le comte replied dartagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	321.0932
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said athos	75.0033
and what did he say to you asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo	165.0702
i am lost said he	31.9616
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine	270.7042
arrived at this last hue it changed no more	426.1419
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office	206.6405
whats that asked porthos what are they firing at now	351.5703
porthos did the same	72.5657
de tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens	176.4061
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of <UNK> who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting <UNK> killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et <UNK>	1577.8699
yes my friend and now now what asked porthos	58.4427
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air	91.9174
well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man ali made a sign in the affirmative	60.7047

henrietta maria and mazarin	364.4481
i am no swordsman well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter	84.1063
doctor doctor cried barrois who felt another fit coming	851.6650
the procureur then told his wife to come up	94.1542
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination	280.7465
tis done they both exclaimed at once	661.9078
one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the _soubrette_ under the gateway of the hôtel but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed she took him gently by the hand	95.2272
she who mistaking you for the cardinals guards has just fled away your companion cried dartagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress	225.8240
the bird on the branch the dog in his <UNK> the sheep in the field the boats moored in the loire even became alive and <UNK>	2654.5056
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony <UNK> and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock	334.1741
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	98.5040
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple <UNK> only i want it julie made a pretence to feel for the key	245.7738
i indeed invited them here today on your account	329.4297
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity and what do you mean to do to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours and what is your excellencys project just this	356.3004
no you do all this not i still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders	113.3368
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been <UNK>	337.4041
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked dartagnan	44.8535
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again	104.1166
now that never happened to us when we were four together	91.6787
dartagnan examined her with a rapid glance	108.3694
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be <UNK> pretty good when i havent eaten for twentyfour hours muttered danglars	168.2102
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo	79.3165
he resembles the old <UNK> of who said to napoleon in you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth	2595.0029
and here madame i must add another word of explanation	305.6317
chapter lxii	216.6979
at ten oclock the next day they met again	37.0092
this <UNK> the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some <UNK> cellars where we must necessarily be <UNK>	2323.6912
it would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos	161.2755
mazarin endeavored to <UNK> among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	228.8687
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word	102.8691
about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars	304.4125
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old <UNK> greatest protectors of <UNK> and sincere <UNK> to their principles	2797.5493
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	92.1331
in this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be killed	489.5150
fatality	nan
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time	210.4476
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he <UNK> me and has murdered me i have also sent for the procureur he will not come in time i feel my life fast <UNK> wait a moment said monte cristo	161.8786
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know	180.9050
but said franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was m ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely i have you intend visiting <UNK> <UNK> you mean the colosseum it is the same thing	294.6098
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in <UNK> arts	898.2906
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window	140.8218
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal	55.2564
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it	203.1626
say rather crime replied the doctor	261.8021
it is not here he cried	31.4315
never a mistake or <UNK> fellow who paid like a prince	3326.0796
albert in his turn sat behind	92.8893
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château dif were interred in an ordinary <UNK> and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of <UNK> it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman	296.7649
chapter xix	254.2227
her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground	214.1943
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristos door	79.4135
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end	151.6819
what	nan
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	184.4843
the bandits laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death <UNK> her sufferings	2289.7588
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene	121.1237
ah said the king i was unjust here is a creature that loves me	68.9973
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	199.8797
send him away or you will never make a man of him i think i shall send him to paris so thought dartagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived	59.0844
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	195.8400
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort i would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as i believe him entirely capable of the descent bravo by what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes every frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat good give the watchword do you want money money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag	251.2932
chapter xxxv	275.6395
they carried a banner on which could be read this strange device we are seeking our king the next following days were occupied in <UNK> movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few <UNK> of <UNK> and the burning of two or three houses	1173.7140
what are you going to do asked the wounded man	17.8838
morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take francs for the profits of the voyage then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib <UNK> up the spanker the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manofwar	484.0991
now he was accustomed to walk with his <UNK> piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind	1436.5751
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of m	185.1690
you were asking then said the host in spanish	156.1338

how pale you are no but i have just met with a terrible adventure are you alone athos _parbleu_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and dartagnan rushed into athoss chamber	135.2165
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them	219.2878
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	127.8158
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned	253.4916

but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted	279.8486
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her	304.4111
de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition oh that is very simple we have not sought to <UNK>	106.3660
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together _ma foi_ said maximilian in consternation	159.6185
and what friends awaited him without	597.9802
at length an old wormeaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol <UNK> of dartagnan	713.9866
fernand saw this and when he learned of the old mans death he returned	84.8855
certainly said dartagnan	9.8127
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of <UNK> and the insolence of <UNK>	391.8121
let us go to monsieur de beaufort the two friends went to the hotel de vendome	21.8874
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos	167.8904
albert was punctual	319.0115
i shall replied dartagnan and instantly in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascons hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it and athos bowed to dartagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts	132.2018
employ me in any other way employ me even <UNK> but let it be on the high roads my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the <UNK> but your strength fails you	238.2877
have you killed the cardinal	44.8982
here is my pass countersigned said the latter	541.1298
aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys	557.0081
delaunay	nan
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château dif he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	137.2082
<UNK> let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constables sword gilt for me and for me put in porthos	1525.1257
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful thank you madame said mazarin	90.3706
although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him i will obey your orders my lord goodbye until saturday when i may expect you may i not yes i promised you the count watched albert waving his hand to him	88.6479
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	194.2319
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the <UNK> was blowing	818.6947
what is your opinion gentlemen and does not m	81.3710
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house	55.5816
keep the <UNK> my dear keep it the young man then entered the apartment of aramis	206.5917
this promise completed poor kittys consolation	21614.0156
let me see have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape	435.4310
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts	170.9279
the count had just opened a door	44.5222
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me	256.3406
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared	50.6847
oh no i remember too well	110.3727
you have not played for a long time dartagnan and i have no inclination to play swear to nothing	90.7143
they are not dead for the death of dartagnan would make a sensation	47.7855
i thought i did not mistake	47.9662
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of	417.1971
what the devil are you doing by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos	493.1779
pooh what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé dherblay ah his friend is with him said raoul	70.4766
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german	243.3659
several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	156.0706
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father the king was not mistaken	100.7761
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet <UNK> voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum	397.5382
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> drops are among my favorite remedies	587.6214
he was not long in making his toilet	113.4838
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	307.0405
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken	131.7517
sit down there before me dartagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standing and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed	98.0460
this house is part of valentines <UNK> and m	1406.5681
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols	239.0720
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because i am only twenty the young woman looked at him furtively	227.7200
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position	249.7348
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de gondy whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows i am at her command ah cursed priest cried anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day i will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious <UNK> you have poured out on me today mazarin wished to approach her	262.5143
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them	312.4854
and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed	454.4867
carlini besought his chief to make an exception in ritas favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom	370.8974
cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question	65.3977

benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family	223.0039
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which dartagnan occupied with authority	144.5429
he could not be mistaken milady was in it	60.9072
a man what man a mendicant give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor sinner this mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see him has he sent no particular message for me yes	369.8593
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	111.4468
the only thing to <UNK> the <UNK> would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself	658.7051
but after he had gone about two hundred steps dartagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his <UNK> to fasten them to his girdle	153.3400
emmanuel went towards the pistols	70.9301
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister	154.4885
will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here no i do not replied monte cristo it is a small place i have purchased quite lately	112.3300

according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door	46.4835

de villefort giving the key to davrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work	195.7970
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	492.5810
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on <UNK> indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	333.3709

luigi vampa	2803.3142
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius <UNK> to death with cabals <UNK> and government intrigues	2124.4216
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is <UNK> is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank	128.7281
i was for twenty years cardinal spadas secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government why from the french government because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbé faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom monsieur returned the	285.6697

it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices	183.3917
dartagnan a little recovered from his first surprise had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy	777.7714
if paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be <UNK>	4126.2090

besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so so much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	118.4063
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man <UNK> himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	249.0185
ah by notre dame as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms	371.5708
nothing my faith so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock now then let us calculate how much we <UNK> in all porthos thirty crowns aramis ten pistoles and you dartagnan twentyfive that makes in all said athos	600.0822

when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here ah what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and <UNK> him he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian	168.2544
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman	74.6734

weak or strong repeated milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul of that spark i will make a flame that shall devour him	314.8240
only warn him that it is you why should i do that because monsieur some mischief might happen to you of what kind in the name of wonder monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains what have you done to him then we have asked him for money the devil ah i can understand that	115.7207
dartagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	145.8845
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his supper	128.6422
then she cried <UNK> under cover of the <UNK> <UNK> striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her	2393.7781

beyond the <UNK> through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in <UNK> of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole lefthand corner of the cellar and a <UNK> the <UNK> of which was left running was yielding by this means the last drop of its blood	624.6890
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much information	464.3171
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of moneya thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of <UNK> that is to say with ready <UNK> default of money we repeat he authorized him after the <UNK> of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion <UNK> upon <UNK> with the motto <UNK> et <UNK>	1896.5902
his early <UNK> of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of <UNK> the martial condition of the <UNK> under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	954.8950

the note is changed	569.4955
at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat	32.0935
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight	157.3899
dartagnan concealed himself in his closet milady called undressed sent away kitty and shut the door	484.0520
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him	144.7110
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	165.3834
and shall we take no notice of this incident m	186.7895
the timely arrival of dartagnan in paris	116.4875
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with <UNK> nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry	198.7901
chapter xvii	136577.8125
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk besides should any illluck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended	251.1285
he entered third and aramis who shut the gate after him last	335.4144
night overtook her she stopped and slept at an inn	245.6725

de trévilles was as gay and cheerful as possible	433.1735
and we say proud as a gascon replied dartagnan	117.3115

m	nan
athos walked about in a <UNK> mood	4394.2368
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent <UNK>	638.6352
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man	48.3856
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search	143.1048
the countess said morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive	61.4371
de villefort when shall i see you again said the latter	56.1665
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening	148.3015
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust	586.7607
as for you although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field valentine colored	880.1440
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound	510.0895
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an <UNK> if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another chance you see i do not conceal myself you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added caderousse with his unpleasant smile	230.4325
but raoul said aramis	66.7317
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are and you asked joannes	210.5875
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	108.1390
that was the question the three musketeers put to one another	75.4201
the most humble clerks such as our <UNK> and <UNK> bless with holy water <UNK> which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers	20907.5273

chapter lxiii	77.4922
<UNK> the pilot of the <UNK> <UNK> went in once and he came back amazed <UNK> that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali <UNK> enchanted cavern i tell you what i have been told then you advise me to accept oh i dont say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the matter franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of <UNK> him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted	294.7121
the procureur no the doctor yes you wish to remain alone with m	154.7714
now said planchet let us thank the queen	37.3547
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of <UNK>	1106.4042
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine a name	333.0582
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch	323.3083
he awaited mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	728.6922
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the kings attorney	302.5148
stay i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this perhaps i can render you this slight service also he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice	145.4595
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature	167.1187
now to supper said aramis	105.9686
monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends	67.0907
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen	255.2455
i landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever	423.4000
the queen rest assured we shall not see her and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal immediately	90.7178
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier said she	218.7239
you were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees	69.7534
what do you mean asked valentine	26.8717
this was the price of the queens diamond	52.9518
it was many years since dartagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again <UNK> perfectly	436.4625
it is kept by a friend of ours at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the peacock yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost <UNK> aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	324.6104
athos glanced at aramis	117.4442
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats chapter lxxvi	994.8905
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	133.5469
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a <UNK>	233.5420
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	521.5695
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities	380.1834

whose then is the air we breathe	586.5392
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs	138.1118
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yesyes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man and a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars	198.6206
were you stopped eagerly inquired the two youths	391.3598
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands	85.0925
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find dartagnan	241.1564
dantès had entered the château dif with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past	299.1625
de wardes i know it cried dartagnan	46.3076
he rejoined this woman they fled together into <UNK> and there he obtained a little curacy	1529.4355
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself	384.6849
at this sigh felton turned round	309.9837
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously	105.4972
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	305.2742
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	139.0074
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments notice	370.6704
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses morrel smiled	570.6350
he was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal	45.3577
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a <UNK>	429.0654
it was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave paris by night had been circulated	239.4037
he knew the abbé de gondy only by report	290.6375
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily <UNK> <UNK> from malaga oranges from the <UNK> <UNK> peaches from france and dates from tunis	45120.5664
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending	385.1540
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of <UNK> treason and conduct <UNK> a member of this <UNK> replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice	620.5265
morrel and i think you will be satisfied on that head	55.3266
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on <UNK> them depended my fathers life replied she	467.6902
felton had not spoken	38.3861
oh sir god knows how much i love <UNK> you see that you forget nothing said athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion	244.5208
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent	232.5918
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open and the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk what monk the monk that was shut in with me no he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window	107.8579
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage	251.3411
have i any need to tell you so	63.6103
two hours thus glided away	290.5214
m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the <UNK> feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile	304.2020
de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m	148.1748
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude	690.3005
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself yes ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty i have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	110.3829
you know that i am as capable of <UNK> a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the _pharaon_ than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties	606.1707
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present	118.9451
why about ten or eleven oclock shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be	252.0811
tis he murmured winter his eyes <UNK> and he allowed his sword to fall to his side	255.6410
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier	415.5235
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m	53.9514
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands	178.9892
dartagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence	58.5012
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twentyfive or twentysix years of age	117.8653
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves this place if monsieur dherblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer	272.0615
dartagnan went straight to the sergeant	50.9596

the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay	485.0002
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	73.3664

the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three <UNK> large one <UNK> and one small and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate and thus learn to write	846.7145
what was most clear in the matter was that dartagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all	85.3184
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty <UNK> poor <UNK> and miserable <UNK> to fall into m	1123.3170

but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king	61.4953
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	73.8204
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself	107.9815
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward	92.6123
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and <UNK> and subsequently when i learned that the use of <UNK> frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and <UNK> a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a <UNK> a <UNK> or a cabanis and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger	606.0814

at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the <UNK> of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate	288.4854
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together	27416.3516

but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfs narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	470.2256
but listen do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard she opened noirtiers door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily	103.9135

how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing	493.8246
i know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch i know not every page of my life but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous <UNK>	221.3096

now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the <UNK> come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time	236.0719
villefort rose and ran towards his motherinlaw for it was she	80.5089

and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	643.4741
but then he may have stopped at saint germain i dont think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette i was there this very day and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling	230.8047

you may now retire	307.9073
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow	358.1333
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed	221.7766

the news caused a great sensation throughout the house madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck	137.9776

porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully well	1060.3086
my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered	383.5418
albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	66.4891

i would then rather die truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not	268.1320
the window yielded	1525.4812
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a <UNK> in the dust	121.4786
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of <UNK>	559.5120

four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a <UNK> without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers	296.5611
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	104.3718
de wardes that provoked her thus	1044.2961
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m	462.1899
she was seated	46.7644
at least you dont speak well of him that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim but this letter in which he recommends you to me is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites but why have you not fled whither should i go	107.8688
dantès seemed full of kindness	557.9058
one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might	144.6265
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind <UNK> to work	481.5209
he was never seen at the theatres at <UNK> or in any place of public resort	833.7734
de villefort saw it open before him	74.7124
he determined to make two cardinals by <UNK> two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich <UNK> was the return the holy father looked for	1405.4304
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz	134.0609
and me too said aramis	142.7339
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	488.8379
the vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast	210.2979

two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you yes it is i and you come asked milady	111.1238
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke <UNK> his brother	232.3814
tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow night these <UNK> words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter	902.8765
of what consequence replied milady	260.5728
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of sanfelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded	810.9083
he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwells letter	132.2905
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and <UNK> like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead	247.9991
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	110.3673
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back	219.0193
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no <UNK> much the worse that has naturally led me to love no <UNK> much the <UNK> you have my profession of faith then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal <UNK> mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin your ruin	929.9654
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen	155.1185
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting her noirtier made a sign that he would listen	141.9675
de tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to him	54.0426
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small <UNK> house behind <UNK> there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant	363.1732
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	452.1091
his father and mother were <UNK> i believe his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter and what name does he now bear mordaunt a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france do you say as a monk it was thus and by mere <UNK> god pardon me if i <UNK> he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune then i understand it all he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled	287.9331
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly	424.2966
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	336.3762
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her	117.7341
and the cry issued from his <UNK> if we may thus <UNK> cry frightful in its silence	5852.6968
but continued dartagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	64.7057
de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment	146.8168
suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in <UNK> robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture	1375.4102
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	136.3654
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	1272.8892
more dead than alive he looked around him	175.7494
come recover the procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale	249.0900
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride	127.6634
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	48.5419
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	64.5883
for my part i wash my hands of the affair so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather	351.7311

speak out theres a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord <UNK> with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor <UNK> in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	239.2773
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos	345.0598
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked dartagnan	665.2574
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	41.5942
de tréville himself returned	67.2619
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space	217.7665
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him	124.6062
each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized and from that moment the sieur de la <UNK> was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues	488.8414
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense <UNK> and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of	195.0714

the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and <UNK>	339.2588
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother	124.7953
your captivity shall be mild be assured and as every inconvenience deserves its <UNK> here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance i cause you dartagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus <UNK> sported with men and millions	541.1011
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion	182.9747
dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend	90.0584
you are not joking are you no on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him	184.7015

whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him	41.5522
i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark true said porthos	878.8725
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do	63.8639
morrel farewell and a thousand thanks i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond	136.0696

the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows	276.8675
do you know what that warning was no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh <UNK> of the cardinal yes thats it no doubt said milady returning the letter to mme	169.7682
chapter liii	205.9894
be content i will depart but you will not follow me you will not watch me i will return home instantly ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme	67.7804
the little apartment was charming for its taste and <UNK> but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to miladys chamber	332.7142
do as you like she said i rely upon you will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command sir what do the people want this time demanded the king	129.4523
that is my answer the answer was terrible	137.8659
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband but how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since you are the ships supercargo why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden	367.4183
if you are young i will be your comrade if you are old i will be your son	58.5158
planchet had no need to learn more	85.8511
then dartagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not succeed	164.9901
i cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me	202.8331
if it was mme	103.2685
on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers	355.9532
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this <UNK> it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle darmilly of whom he had heard much	203.0356
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck	199.7061
although general dépinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments	3547.2175
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and sound m	141.2233
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race i am highly flattered returned beauchamp	173.0714
come with us said albert	46.8761
what can i do for you valentine valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtiers eyes	175.3392
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn	233.5764
now then said andrea while dressing himself ill wait till he leaves and then ill slip away m and saying this andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain	565.2197
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m	190.3175
do you see that ray of <UNK> i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you	355.8239
grimaud rose	186.4898
de villefort yes but can he understand you yes oh said villefort <UNK> delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him <UNK> be satisfied i can understand my father while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently	384.1055
_pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied dartagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air	108.0080
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon you are adorable madame but do not keep raoul with you why not because he is in love he he is quite a child and tis a child he loves athos became thoughtful	170.6518
there <UNK> in that <UNK> brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material <UNK> sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with <UNK>	9136.4785
cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle	593.9046
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the <UNK> down on the ground	902.2211
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner	127.0644
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet and if i am taken i will swallow it well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said dartagnan	61.3379
come you are no longer twenty years old to my great regret mordieu ah if i were but twenty years old yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies but now we must part	196.7974
such is the atrocious logic of revolutions	5454.4131
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee truly honor luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest	194.6149
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her masters orders	593.3320
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some <UNK> stab with a knife for instance and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray	177.6138
the next morning when kitty presented herself at dartagnans she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death	338.9357
let us <UNK> the fine gentleman said others	2855.0776
about this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand	90.1083
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	253.0492
who are you cried selim	186.0059
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de <UNK>	773.6689
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	146.7634
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed	313.8476
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him	130.2752
it was about nine oclock in the morning	28.3019
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not	65.6523
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street	33.7471
explain yourself my lord i am listening the queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to saint germain aha said dartagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave paris a womans <UNK> understand yes i understand perfectly said dartagnan	116.3135
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend	297.9771
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and paper	156.7638
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	1634.9966
what do you mean other men may have entered before them and waited for them we can find out said grimaud	123.9761
edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his knees	233.5017
how pale you are and blood too what is this it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms in your <UNK> man but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him	172.2606
danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune	139.5482
no sir but i am severely what can we do said dartagnan we must return to paris i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again	95.8358
i go said he i go at once how you will go said mme	78.4085
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	602.8970
the air the fresh free air is so good besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour stop cried dartagnan i too am going and if i may without impertinence <UNK> are you going to seek my friends what friends those that you asked about yesterday athos porthos and <UNK> are looking for them yes on honor what then is there surprising in that nothing	447.3832
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	199.9595
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	299.9534
dartagnan returned to change his <UNK> clothes for his <UNK> suit and porthos to put on his red doublet	1491.5419
de villeforts pardon no said noirtier	165.3013
the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master	154.0913
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing dartagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying i am not <UNK> you my friend	514.0262
faria saw this	109.2335
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances	237.7795
i am not unhappy while i possess my son ah just so said albert here begins the trial	198.9832
come this way gentlemen come m	392.9841
he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being <UNK> it is all from the same cause make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered beware morcerf he is already an old man i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally	199.5905
dartagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of <UNK> and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile	256.4199
i see you no longeri am <UNK> me help me here i am sir said athos leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here i am take my hand and jump into our boat mordaunt made a last <UNK> the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair	274.3235
the chancellor made a profound reverence	1201.5123
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair <UNK> with seaweed and body soaking in <UNK> whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned	795.7060
only imagine what happiness that would afford me	500.9181
was <UNK> by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	568.0242
shall you keep it or send it back i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it	90.0441
aramis was astonished	174.6135
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest <UNK>	170.0446
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m	459.2389
dont you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	114.6579
do you know monsieur dartagnan lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are monsieur dartagnan i am then you came here to defend him him	70.1082
would not that dress please you what do you mean asked mercédès with an angry <UNK> do you mean	401.9518
yes i see for the young man raoul said dartagnan	39.1125
at six oclock the curate of st merri was announced	92.9014
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta said the queen	41.4799
it was midnight	314.8800
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut i will believe all you say so proceed but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than <UNK> who was a <UNK> and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the <UNK> of half your audience	246.7128
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold	4627.8291
i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels	781.0296
we have money a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse	233.6766
never had he been so well received	87.8773
ah it is you my lord said he	15.6597
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to dartagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion	59.5171
mercédès was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so <UNK> from her ready wit	302.5321
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of dartagnan	57.5402
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter my <UNK> friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand	194.3633
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	5243.1777
they explained what had occurred that evening	372.7614
it is my happiness my treasure my hope	229.9106
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him <UNK> over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate <UNK>	285.9026
albert that and he may know what to answer you oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right	107.9441
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if i am not dead i shall have seen you again <UNK> if i have to overturn the world and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment	230.3768
most likely replied vampa coolly	1045.1447
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself	103.1854
dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless	291.3910
he went to him	39.2735
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way	182.8303
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron what is monsieur voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore what is the matter with him he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die is he then so ill dear voiture asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain	263.5818
you talk of sacrilege why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude	88.6488
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done dartagnan but perhaps you have been wrong dartagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	98.5334
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste <UNK> you wrongfully without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done sire replied m	539.2348
lucien debray	7546.5396
there he found everything arranged in due <UNK> accusation examination morrels petition m	25109.6895
we will wait for these gentlemen so please you i have plenty of time and it will be more correct	97.3095
take the republic for a tutor let us return with renewed strength to the battlefield and i promise you soldiers another marengo and a second austerlitz	565.2916
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort more especially since your wishes <UNK> with mine and as soon as m	291.0791
well m	198.2784
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together it is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet	207.1391
without that what would become of me it was one oclock in the morning	63.6650
but such is man we always want something more than we already have what does porthos wish for to be a baron ah true i forgot said athos laughing	212.0050
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed	183.8023
felton arose	382.1529
the <UNK> follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing <UNK> <UNK>	678598.5000
has she then been appointed provost of merchants no but she has become queen of paris <UNK> interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the palais royal or the tuileries she is installed at the hotel de ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke you didnt tell me of that aramis really	326.6592
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become <UNK> as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	328.8130
perhaps you liked what m	329.8709
eh dartagnan he cried	110.9172
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort	240.4144
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en <UNK> so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring	855.9594
dartagnan already wore his <UNK> being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so <UNK> paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit	613.2544
i swear it before heaven and the queen raised her eyes solemnly <UNK>	1165.8914
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from dartagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said dartagnan who will attend you in your campaigns why replied porthos mouston of course this was a blow to dartagnan	159.4923
to give your majestys reply to those who await it stay marechal i will not appear to <UNK> with rebels madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return anne of <UNK> eyes shot glances of fire	441.0785
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey	97.1923
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	175.3980
morrel said he eagerly	63.3164
what do you want	12.0579
they searched they questioned	2699.8718
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be	833.1772
from a distance dantès recognized the <UNK> and handling of _la jeune amélie_ and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landingplace he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered <UNK> from his late accident	1163.8645
de morcerf ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome true true cried danglars	129.8073
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building the dog again shook his head as if to say no then said the prisoner lets think who it can be	224.7943
dont you think the executioner might be master cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself ah just so	276.6667
she found milady with a smiling countenance	142.1721
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent	200.9917
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	78.7537
we too said athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from england but have just come from there what	207.7080
you mean to say we <UNK> <UNK> said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table	437.1725
they entered	454.9276
each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventyfive pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed	144.8067
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep	338.3142
the <UNK> of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg sainthonoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchengarden of about an acre	508.8578
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh	153.8228
danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked andrea	158.2318
beauchamp and it is always well done sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin	72.8450
tis indeed they said she	133.6190
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but dartagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis	122.6882
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to love any of us the old mans eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness	186.0957
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested what will they dare to arrest a man in his majestys service _pardieu_ they did not scruple much in the case of athos	118.5667
what is the matter said the count	7.3075
thus bassompierre who was at once protestant and <UNK> by conviction and catholic as commander of the order of the holy ghost bassompierre who was a german by birth and a frenchman at <UNK> short bassompierre who had a distinguished command at the siege of la rochelle said in charging at the head of several other protestant nobles like himself you will see gentlemen that we shall be fools enough to take la rochelle and bassompierre was right	684.5622

standing well at court whether the king <UNK> was of the older or younger branch whether the government was <UNK> liberal or <UNK> looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m	1387.0042

execution it was near midnight the moon lessened by its decline and reddened by the last traces of the storm arose behind the little town of armentières which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses and the skeleton of its high belfry	582.1465
aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for mme	424.6008
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed dartagnan to porthos and went on his way	248.5425
add another day for landing and that would make four	238.0880

feverish and excited i rang at the door	145.5345
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any <UNK> interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey	295.0276

beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and <UNK> recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream	616.9759
de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father	2887.2920
leave them said monte cristo	12.9592
