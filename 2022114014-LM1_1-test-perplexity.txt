have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more who i am madame	269.9922
no but my mother as a child saw her	153.6245
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos	381.1084
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth	349.4663
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task and you will do right	1034.3572
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile	4848.7720
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance	2311.2659
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister that is a strange question said aramis	122.9899
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it	565.6492
aha continued dartagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced	908.7213
i have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts what a rope ladder yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes cant be sent around a ball like a letter no but it may be sent in something else in something elsein something else	1349.7755
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object	2594.1814
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant	329.4160
yes he is a terrible antagonist	4148227.2500
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	39.2617
in short what shall i say to you felton continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime	199.1435
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris	1654.0350
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue	15403.1797
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	580.5118
he will amass wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others	2885.7449
see what an exordium cried the jesuit	65.2404
at ten oclock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten dartagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last but that was not all they must get to london	680.5009
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal franz and i have to thank you a thousand times count returned albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down	430.0762
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room	3744.6187
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	143.6286
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles	1917.9395
dartagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into dartagnans breast crying one for you and one for methe best for last cried dartagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body	385.2958
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated	639.2650
linen and wine are both being warmed come the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	466.9103
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion	603.6448
while monte cristo had begged the smellingbottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars	112.0946
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post	1712.4717
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints	591.0304
is this carriage for me said dantès	66.6532
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed dartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger i am told that there is a general insurrection the uniform of the kings musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns did you witness the injury sustained by comminges monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards the cardinal smiled as he spoke	241.2502
m the third act passed off as usual	178.1287
two horses that monsieur de tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which i am now going to take a ride to st germain well and what are you going to do at st germain then demanded athos	138.0533

then some words were spoken by the two women	91.4336
he is very susceptible bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself true	1126.6761
morrel and mercédès came to see him but his door was closed and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer	100.9779
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it	314.7733
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit	274.6215
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner how foolish you are have you forgotten that m	439.4456
dartagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he dartagnan and his friend had rendered to the queens party in the morning	265.1224
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge then you disapprove of duelling	472.8295
danglars is his banker is he not asked châteaurenaud of debray	477.0959
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo	5023.3462
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase you followed him cried athos	194.2086
but he will make it up in you i am sure	177.6609
four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles a pistole is not enough said dartagnan tis worth a louis what is worth a louis four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis four hundred said porthos	467.0992
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later	720.5372

he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness	69961.9219
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee the sergeant began to laugh	647.9241
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	2269.0762
now sir i am listeninggo on i will come at once to the point	105.1239
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young mans head fell on his breast	345.3220
stopbutit is very strangeoh my god my head swims i cannot see help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried dartagnan	2103.5798
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe	265.8383
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at portolongone and scratches himself for amusement added the king	126176.6953
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks	407.4603
yes replied madame de villefort and would you believe it count believe what you think this house pretty do you not i think it charming well my husband would never live in it indeed returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m	252.4211
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	5135.0225
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger	217.7700
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad	1477.4238
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road	478.9401
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance	466.1217
a galleyslave escaped from confinement at toulon and what crime has he committed he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him	128.9383
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth	227.8860
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	145.2278
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother ah excuse me then said dartagnan	235.2390
look look doctor said villefort he is quite coming round again i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence m	415.5692
at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl	2514.1414
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle	235.5143
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches	1152.1462
since the death of madame de saintméran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house	152.5770
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you but listen they appear to be speaking of me dartagnan drew near the window and lent his ear	164.3675
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	129.4003
mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little	12655.7812
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha	98.7059
thats lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders	1.5083
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps	96.4837
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late	202.3588

monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france in some parts of franceyes excellency you know the environs of paris then no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude	444.7873
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance	6166.5708
see if he is still in the same place athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole	185.4633
the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past	487.5371
moreover you are our prisoners fool cried aramis knowest thou not then mordaunt	101036.6094

anne of austria at the age of fortysix	3786.8589
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master	1250.1825
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m	306.8922
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik that is just said richelieu	965.9547
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies cannot hear us but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets yes said athos thats grimauds business well then cried dartagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls heaven forfend said athos they may serve us these bodies serve us said porthos	785.3531

much money to be gained said bonacieux protruding his lip	9497.3643
parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway declined	1477.8691
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice my advice is this said monsieur darminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat	220.6924

the first idea that occurred to miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant	445.1465
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling	164.1095
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it fifty thousand francs for being your father	132.7000
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	988.6010
at the same time he felt the dukes arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush smiling as he uttered the word	1267.4792
dartagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris	159.4638
dartagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron	529.7606
ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient	572.7018
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion	727.6668
_pardieu_ said villefort he is a noble fellow	84.7036
poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to dartagnan when he passed through her chamber but milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the staircase	152.6836
meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him but the first lines aroused his attention he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on m	140.5269

many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations	729.3196
as for me when i have no candle i cant take two steps without knocking against something thats because you havent served said mousqueton	2751.7136

well cried his auditors at the moment you left his house aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat	236.5516
the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself	231.9869

de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine wellgrown girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat	1894.7788
the law would seize it and put you in prison if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth or perhaps francs from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other	361.6711

but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance good said milady to herself who knows i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the vein she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	457.0649

de villefort entered followed by barrois	680.2886
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queens letter short but explicit gave him the clue	713.5608

have you had any account of it none	127.2440
oh it is not yet fixed murmured fernand	31544.2949
i cannot hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever require stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	1047.0226

the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney	868.2834

father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	135.6646
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	569.0658

you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo	306.5253

albert rejoined his mother she was very pale	67.6429
monsieur du tremblay received dartagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	312.3080
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but i cant be severe with him he is really _so_ bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m	821.5906
do what i tell you and immortality awaits you villefort fell on his knees	354.5122
the four old friends prepare to meet again	110.3704
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased	1164.3579
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission and then instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself	163.7784
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein	7888.8569
dartagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking halfpast eight	1227.3507
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m	824.9667

monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment	200.8320

the ball struck the animal full in front	366.8017
then i saw that they took me for the assassin	89.8478
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers	260.7247
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles	1277.0220
it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first	64.3726
de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly and de tréville as you know is one of the queens greatest friends	588.7649

mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred	543.9409
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of dartagnan and his yellow horse	308.8391
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money	1350.6053
can it be bad news i fear it i will leave you with this stranger but as soon as he is gone if you will permit me i will return _permit_ you	82.9314
he had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine	1050.4617

the youths dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day	4794.4531

dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner	913.3909
you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself no i do not wish to come between a father and son	79.1952

the young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself	687.7962
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landingplace passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return	1252.6685
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos	1153.1976
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	820.3124
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	76.1633
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman	253.5099

might not this young man be sent by his eminence	223.6087
no replied dartagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people cannot see whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion chastised monsieur said dartagnan the expression is strong it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face ah _pardieu_ i know full well that you dont turn your back to yours and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly	354.6806
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets	442.4596
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed	5698.3994
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do	830.9733

franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert	156.9744
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheekbones of grimaud were favorable signs	7745.4780
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg sainthonoré	1776.1858
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother	142.1088

m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention	449.1282
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty but tell me dantès if you had command of the _pharaon_ should you be glad to see danglars remain captain or mate m	376.6248

if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other i dont say exactly answered the gascon confused	155.7017
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	942.0099
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	481.6641
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	6214.3848
arrived at the hotel it was not long before athos entered	142.0349

i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	664.0882
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each	319.6264

you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one	767.8734
danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sittingroom where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness	794.0507
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the first	1014.5406
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	753.3453
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	125.8052
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	577.3931
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count	229.8569
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing	237.9010
there is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe	872.3000
mine was carried away by a ball	130.3233
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet	291.5081
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face	316.2280
well so much the better for in that case i shall demand of his majesty permission to plead for him the king feared an outbreak	834.8559
of this wine the first bottle being a little thick at the bottom brisemont poured the lees into a glass and dartagnan desired him to drink it for the poor devil had not yet recovered his strength	715.4272
_certes_ said aramis i do justice to the beauties of this thesis but at the same time i perceive it would be overwhelming for me	257.4132
de richelieu who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine my friends monsieur the queen shook her head	241.9037

la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him	182.5996
franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of braccianos	153.5233
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort ah i understand replied porthos she has ordered relays of horses exactly so and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said dartagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction	145.8839
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the _lorgnette_ and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	467.6106
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman	929.7104
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctors niece hold your tongue porthos said athos you are insupportable will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise he took you for buckingham cried dartagnan	254.4903

yes noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything	671.9896
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers	523.0265

the little light in the lodge had long been extinct	1329.8386

by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household	503.8438

no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting manfred	429.9889
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart	346.8605
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter	174.8162
it would be exceedingly droll the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	339.1917
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that goodnature of which your eminence speaks	273.9483
for pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble	1399.2698
will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor	1031.6279
where have you come from my dear count said albert	49.8340
beauchamp and it is always well done sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin	168.1281
dantès was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones	1325.1185
groslow jumped in followed by mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of london and mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the isle of dogs	1718.1342
danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs	5436.6987
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible	29168.7793
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs	8678981.0000
god is always the last resource	68168.6328
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god	2106.2776
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	241.7990
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten oclock and the queen at what time is it her wish to start at midnight then it is possible	96.9938
besides courage was out of the question here dartagnan had fallen into an ambush	471.7048
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	158.0560
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time	121.3399
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard no to be sure replied dartagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him groslows face brightened	1295.2316
only leave him in the anteroom as i wish to speak to you alone dartagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour both commands alike both at the palais royal	536.1509
the devil take the madman murmured m	1973.6611
if it is a snare replied dartagnan i shall scent it out be assured	1324.3851

at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos	235.7431
oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out in what way why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them	190.7043
patrick soon caught the sound of his masters voice calling his falcon	350.9305
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood	1133.6934
oh why did i not tell you all	25.1590
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you an agreeable one asked the italian	196.4901
and you did not awaken me i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be fatigued from yesterday oh sir how good you are athos smiled	156.3380
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated	544.2745
from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow	493.4760
the sailors looked at one another	25.5616
excuse me gentlemen said morrel but i do not see m	43.1747
dartagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task	51917.7578
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst dartagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity	2813.1335
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the hôtel de londres	112.0875
it was the fault of their horses not theirs another pause	2857.4258
morrel had agreed to meet him	42.4452
is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m	437.1805
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and dartagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	1743.7109
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead	391.5181
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marblelike features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	440.8889
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar	86.5316
well said villefort what is itwho rangwho asked for me a stranger who will not send in his name a stranger who will not send in his name what can he want with me he wishes to speak to you to me yes did he mention my name yes what sort of person is he why sir a man of about fifty short or tall about your own height sir dark or fair darkvery dark with black eyes black hair black eyebrows and how dressed asked villefort quickly	411.8536
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contrary what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed	83.9527
is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips	368.0228
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m	330.3532
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dantès	1654.5479
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friends chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself againthat is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men	384.2392
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughters hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure	603.6812
i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held	2211.7896
the abbé took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond	1506.7717

nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert	1133.0907
i once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said i shall do but i have done so and so that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil darker and more silent even than the bastile	447.8276
a terrible inclination seized dartagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained himself	470.2258
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey monsieur darminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse	1233.1360
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard	539.3801
the enemys army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them	1061.0309
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much planchet shook his head and said nothing	99.0599
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	96.5573
here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest folk of course cried danglars	1074.8794
that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand	184.5114
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three dartagnanswith two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men	473.0676
oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame felton my brother my friend i conjure you no cried felton no you shall live and you shall be avenged felton i bring misfortune to all who surround me felton abandon me felton let me die well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner	495.5357
you know something of that as well as i do i think	47.3534
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me	512.0037
then he had a moments hesitation	70288.8828
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of dartagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing dartagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other	820.5773
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge	1610.3575

edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto	2125.4084
i will take him dead thats all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	521.7325
i wish it then aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage	2474.6924
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph	3081.6555
i will profit by the advice and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	970.1276

but to return to what you were saying beauchamp well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m	360.6448
no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back	410.7812
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver	401.8115

he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	2313.9973

i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle mademoiselle cried valentine mademoiselle oh selfish man he sees me in despair and pretends he cannot understand me you mistakei understand you perfectly	4321.6938
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and bound	1396.2617
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire	221.2504
and who is the assassin they asked together	3228.4417
can we do anything for you asked athos	67.2863
at six oclock lord de winter came in	29.7176
the curate then entered followed by planchet	107.2042
they went towards the forest and soon entered it	152.4620
he found him kneeling before a _priedieu_ with his head leaning on an open prayer book	3883.2295
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground	302.8674
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy	98.0089
do you say resumed dartagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman i tell you i am sure of it continued the host	126.5748
cromwell gazed a moment after him	3773.7864
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me i was wrong a hundred times wrong	373.0975
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service that may be true replied porthos but i am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much oh blind selflove thought dartagnan	560.3755
they passed through two rooms furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor pastrini and were shown into an elegantly fittedup drawingroom	970.9583
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	4170.2432
speak on they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent which of the two denounced him	527.5151
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	35585.2578
it is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars	1753.9438
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me	284.2553
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	749.5231
excuse me albertsorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance	66276.2734
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought dartagnan	595.0033
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	48270.2969
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ah nonsense cried dartagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method what i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted and then asked mazarin turning pale	252.1063
then morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen	116.2180
one said the gravediggers two three and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	464.1330
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention	219.7631
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of monte cristo	975.5811
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos	1479.0591
it was for this i had annulled the leaseit was for this i had comeit was for this i was waiting	918.0176
bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at st cloud and not elsewhere before the destréess pavilion and not in another street	532.2092
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur dherblay i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me really monsieur you say strange things said aramis	458.9037
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him	790.9252
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude	22456.8301
you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i require	84.6791
tomorrow then monsieurtomorrow till then god preserve your majesty however ill the king might sleep m	785.4280
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	356.1252
de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans	14068.4385
but let us wait a little and reflect	296.0672
a letter said the young man	1.7804
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarins niece	1103.9653
cheer up said she to noirtier	2433.3677
he wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his mouth	540.9681
so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes	169.8228
no more than a drop of water in the ocean remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the abbé	648.9456
by the light of one of these torches dartagnan perceived men in uniform	1825.3120
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself	346.7391
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume	559.0490
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him oh count said de winter for whom do you take me for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way de winter shook him by the hand	197.2633
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory	688.5949
so let us go and get killed where we are told to go	635.2252
however amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent	8061.6460
the comte de wardes was announced and dartagnan was introduced	269.3070
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse and m	292.5335
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn	813.3600
_morbleu_ monsieur said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you perhaps said athos	460.8088
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth	1697.1127
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate	132.1864
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult	439.7555
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses	841.1161
well then we will put simply _my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_ my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	808.5869
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger	104.0060
then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex eugénie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure	2420.2913
a black point floated on the sea	80.2560
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though ive been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good my pastry not good well monsieur la ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at once i cannot i replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an hour in half an hour yes have you breakfasted faith no well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old burgundy so you see my lord since i am hungry i would with your highnesss leave and la ramee bent low	419.8344
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire	266.8626
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne	1668.9659
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her	62.9519
what did your father tell you m	29.9471
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains	244092.6094
eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly	232.6980
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	626.2267
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	855.2593
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	4927.3042
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box	560.5505
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections but god forgive me cried anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her i believe that you are yourself interrogating yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur dartagnandartagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman	372.6317
dartagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right	50.0309
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	374.1531
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house where you can be relieved asked de guiche	279.3514
are these persons then so rich and powerful do you not know their history i do not	98.4716
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis	206.7704
de boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to a high office in the police and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars	340.7515
i will not die alonei will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands	1542.6613
my faith it was time that idea came into porthoss head	4003.0247
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace	458.4263
danglars m sir replied danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog i kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness	360.7243
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos	881.6196
dantès saw that he must attack the wedge	17109.1367
do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the cardinal	374.4651
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	280.4913
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis	163.8312
my friend said she how came you here	2099.0017
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	29951.1074
i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m	586.6743
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii	166031.9688
de boville and on the th the francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man	917.3104

ah cried blaisois he is lost grimauds a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton	4417.2324
there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand	320.1737
i had but to write to the duchessebut i wont repeat her name for i am incapable of compromising a woman but this i know that i had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred the procurators wife shed a tear	179.1206
i have reflected and i cannot must not be guilty of such a sin ah you have reflected said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and i also have reflected upon what that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word oh my god murmured felton	131.9508
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what i mean yes sir	333.2415
stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the ironsides this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his bodyguard	1302.0245
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes	1228.1592
i supplicate you i implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself	1933.8717
but tell me valentine how has it all been effected	1205.2323
oh my dear friend if this be the caseif you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoleddo not complain count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arms of a friend	305.5572
as soon as the earnest money was paid dartagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almostnew doublet of the elder m	807.3756
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did	135.6124
he used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat	1997199.5000
dartagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	4359.7036
what does it signify to you if i am murdered	208.3074
i am happy to see m	312.5609
where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom	4499.1812
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in oh i was arranging a little surprise for you indeed	455.1276
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	2888.2256
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist well then family affairs perhaps family i have happily only myself in the world to care for but what makes you sigh my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy you are not happy porthos	358.2248
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us	1261.7699
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend	1694.9194
yes cut the cable then athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord	281.1170
it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it do not be too hasty m	452.1913
to london cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in london that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to me but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none nor i said aramis	138.3941
how sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majestys shoulder	1190.4470
come sir wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other key go and fetch it i will leave you the torch sir no take it away i can see in the dark why you are like no	186.8792
de saintméran my motherinlaw madame de saintméran barrois and my daughter valentine ah sir exclaimed madame de villefort clasping her hands what do you say it is not for you to interrogate but to answer is it to the judge or to the husband stammered madame de villefort	103.6584
at his mothers ball he danced once with eugénie and m	296486.2812
what more do you want i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person absolutely then as i said before sirvery well i am ready to marry m	467.2950
m it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation	68.0398
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said dartagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force	954.2422
do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellowsufferer does not perish with him	219.9332
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell	241.8833
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wallflowers	660.8837
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene	1060.3915
i have two things to postpone and what are they first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillets and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me oh fiea quarrel between priests a duel between allies what can i do friend	3421.0603

m pretty strong rum said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve	145.6351
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape patience said the abbé in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience caderousse looked at him with amazement	956.9799
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	280.6991
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said _saccommodi_ the italian _saccommodi_ is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molières that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance	549.7025
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her you are right said dartagnan i will have done with her	341.7087
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness thanks my captain replied dartagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general	159.5047
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice	313.9547
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors	489.6322
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	4604.7119
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner	216.9464
you smile yes why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	260.2834
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travellingcarriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no and stopped in the yard	303.9426
at eccuis the same scene was repeated	419.0933
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg	1239.9349
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	331.0118
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king	90.2822
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days	1527.6731
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head	1428.2354
i leave you therefore as i took yourich but little respected	1871.4578
true he replied and my protector is very kind that dear protector said caderousse and how much does he give you monthly five thousand francs as many thousands as you give me hundreds truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate	804.1697

and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	504.7270

bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friends valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five	1012.2694
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded	140.1045
the black horses of the musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incognito	959.3951
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause	1737.6941
he could not be mistaken milady was in it	154.6409
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people	93.9577
i was so delighted to see her again i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris for the cause which today takes us to england and what is this cause demanded aramis	228.0652

te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout france	56734.8047
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but youll die of hunger said the patron	6555.3721
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business	1090.8743
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same	364.6223
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	301.7621
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation	288.4137
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated deaddead m chapter	1591.0319
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier	260.8906
it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that mans favor	217.8084
de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him	120.7527
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king be easy said aramis i will take two poniards and give one to parry	742.5068
i know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid that is to the purpose	590.2173
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said beauchamp in a calm tone	110.7795
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft the duke had already begun to descend	488.0821
poor dear monsieur dartagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans hand	303.6875
besides even you didnt recognize me they will be much less likely to that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you	74.1194
the latter had surpassed himself he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with monsieur de beauforts coatofarms	5102.9927
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber	819.5583
humph murmured athos it is certainly she and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady	868.7787
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed	1550.0399
monsieur dartagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed dartagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle	118.9516
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on somebody	1035.1886
ah by notre dame as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms	968.2365
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent	778.6991
dartagnan was the first to recover from his surprise	223.1159
he fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling	1395.2275
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	287.3430
if you deprive me of that take away my life also we are forbidden to shed your blood and by whom are you forbidden by him we obey you do then obey someone yes a chief i thought you said you were the chief so i am of these men but there is another over me and did your superior order you to treat me in this way yes but my purse will be exhausted probably come said danglars will you take a million no two millionsthreefour	321.2489
you appear to forget yourself sadly no sir said albert coldly there are circumstances in which one cannot except through cowardicei offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at least what is your errand then with me sir i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplacei mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficientwhere two men having met one of them will remain on the ground danglars turned pale cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him	638.8707
the queen was as we have said of great beauty	125.9928
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god	404.4713
thats well monsieur de tréville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to me	1246.9777
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	263.3467
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going	13347.8828
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage	1046.3733
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty	527.2460
so much the better duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the door	69.5099
the abbess introduced them to each other	165.2726
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired	290.0344
they were said however to be of good extraction	2325.0012
oh meddle in nothing which concerns me	435.1597
de rothschild and you have seen her her m the beautiful greek of yesterday no we heard i think the sound of her _guzla_ but she remained perfectly invisible when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	486.2247
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that dartagnan himself could hardly recognize him	831.2146
the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely	1390.0776
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity	356.0780
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner	420.2744
you have decidedly some genius at your control _ma foi_ spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvetlined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf	281.9889
presently presently cried the latter when you havent your cloak on at one oclock then behind the luxembourg very well at one oclock then replied dartagnan turning the angle of the street	237.3173
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival	699.1023
well be on our side now resumed aramis	2149.0046
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath	659.8975
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	8858.0059
well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany he is rich then i believe so but that ought to be visible that is what deceives you debray i do not understand you have you read the _arabian nights_ what a question well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds	726.6682
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head look at england madame yes but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen	348.3031
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least we shall see	331.3079
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	532.7914
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air well then a happy and merry life to you	503.6434
redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution	22108.4570
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly	206.5155
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments	1886.7762
dartagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his own	2007.6825
at that moment the door opened	39.7892
morrel obeyed guided by valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly	215.9615
porthoss chamber is you say on the first story number one yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that i could have let ten times over bah be satisfied said dartagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard oh monsieur procurators wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier and did you convey this answer to your guest we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission so that he still expects his money oh lord yes monsieur yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathauds account in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be softened	658.1022
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his business here then _pardieu_ he has come to draw but i dont know how much you will know presently my friend very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day what do you meanof whom do you speak	212.4522
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread what do you say to this du vallon i said porthos i am entirely of dartagnans opinion this is a beastly country this england you are quite decided then to leave it asked athos of dartagnan	409.4649
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of monsieur dartagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur dartagnan shall not leave us the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men	133.0675
the priest stole the sacred vases and sold them but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested	351.8661
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong	307.0228
nevertheless monsieur de trévilles company of musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will	846.9535
m indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does	892.5173
i began to fear that he would not come	40.5747
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine do you want me to go away ah no no	83.7060
have you seen anything they asked	332.4375
i will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons	1051.0312
well picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillcertainly frightful perhaps sanguinary the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat	1362.2976
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me	140.9619
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself	1083.6121
it is magnificent said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words	646.3731
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	8595.2725
concerning a court intrigue chapter ix	7970.9019
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing theres no need to go over the ground a second time ah it was this gentleman said dartagnan bowing to the officer	132.1967
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn i did not perceive that there were three of us then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is fernandthe man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world	182.5057
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity	1150.1937
none for a moment dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada	611.2083
the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother	139.1179
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier dherblay two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword	292.0196
thank you countthank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation yes everyone in my family is well so much the better yet you have something to tell me replied the count with increased anxiety	206.0354
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell	79.2939
the counts eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel	371.5015
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute	404.4477
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiffnecked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir	510.4058
morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen	483.2939
ah these musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be hanged no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire ill be their warranty	728.4882
you understand that is to say i guess your wishes and that is all thats necessary said madeleine	597.9556
the trial at eight oclock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamps door	171.5854
athos had even gone so far as to question m	103.2745
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity	4684.3325
do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille oh a day and night soon pass away	546.0911
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseauyou rememberthe mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger	2789.9282
this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allées de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth	834.2161
of what use is it to be a churchman pray	949.7242
indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish i foppish	2317.6614
is it your decision athos resumed the gascon	122.7963
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price	837.1217
de villefort relieved all dantès apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort	1099.4475
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own	349.3189
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	271.4456
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy	116.5160
then he took the boy upon his knee	230.4595
return to paris said he assemble the servants who remain there	1495.0103
gentlemen cried chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to fight go then into charenton for i shall begin in a short timetheres a signal from the prince the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince	362.6032
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left	61.2726
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse and here is danglars who is a wideawake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong	148.8431
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret	1357.4512
no one has come out he replied	130.1022
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out it would be very easy if you much wished it how so probably you have some correspondent in greece i should think so at yanina everywhere well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today do so i will m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you you will oblige me danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his _coupé_	507.9858
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	115.1682
what do you say i say that it was you who gave me the wine i say that it was you who desired me to drink it	44.0799
the hostess as she entered saw dartagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon dartagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly	1142.8585
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur	121.7875
ah is it you dantès cried the man in the skiff	82.2508
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going _dentro la testa_ answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture	3146.2830
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of limetrees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south	6670.4961
a small door close to the lodge of the _concierge_ gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot	1827.6305
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	231.2342
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours chapter vii	1112.0828
the hour came for him to retire	97.0155
the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprisedfor in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte	463.9814
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement	870.5917
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your fathers favor and that i might do him justice	287.2198
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinals directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman	1443.1292
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad alas sire it is but too true louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance	465.2590
dartagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use	1507.0182
dartagnan he said you are here tonight still infuriated by yesterdays adventure	21867.8145
you have lived on the money he has given you true said caderousse benedetto has become the son of a great lord how can he be the son of a great lord a natural son and what is that great lords name the count of monte cristo the very same in whose house we are benedetto the counts son replied monte cristo astonished in his turn	215.3049
one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès chamber	383.5740
m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtiers room	317.9666
as a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of rochelleas at suze and perpignan but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage we want men of talent	5485.1274
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital	214.9773
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever	609.6315
and after this reasoning she slept easily	25507.5664
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme	21448.9023
you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you why do you say so because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m	212.5767
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my suicide	732.8259
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london why so because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice ah but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for you would be all the wiser said athos	254.5153
m what is he doing there said the inspector	56.0792
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced	167.1724
a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht	437.8514
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom	747.7515
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsfrom lord ruthven to countess g precisely i was sure of it said morcerf	353.6788
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom i have sent unto you the four friends exchanged glances	1103.0276
let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you	43.9040
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	27.8695
danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked andrea	251.6833
i would take the hundred pistoles	7.7164
ifaith colonel said dartagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast	1447.9044
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him	383.8014
holloa young peoplestop there said the tutor joining in the conversation	3003.8567
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile	88655.5781
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	1672.6411
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy	296.5256
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me	319.1887
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart go monsieur de bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed	539.6613
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions	282.3010
this lady is infamous my lord milady de winter is an angel you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you bah are you mad to talk to me thus said buckingham	175.3838
the instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m	447.3633
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti	507.3784
from this moment i become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs i ought to occupy myself in yours madame replied athos i have only to ask your majestys prayers and i said aramis i am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve the queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to de winter if you need money my lord separate the jewels i have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some jew	211.6676
pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master	571.1517
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	832.1942
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted	885.4974
although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a steppingstone	450.3336
see what she writes to me athos said he	67.3345
all these women had been or were beautiful	914.6313
morrel left on old dantès chimneypiece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt	1070.2566
joannes _ma foi_ said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight	802.6262
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy	5272.9180
you see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yoursthat were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another oh valentine were i in your place and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars and said take this hand dearest maximilian and believe that living or dead i am yoursyours only and forever the poor girl made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears	811.8012

happily for him he has ceased to bear that name and therefore said dartagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé dherblay	246.2198

he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell	326.6543
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	9087.2432

but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of selfdependence that characterized her countenance	1243.5996

at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request	493.9341
what were you doing replied she	66.7825

but in this world we must risk something	425.7229
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	809.3395

dartagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	159.6676

no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death edmond still heard the sound	414.6650
ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	47.0003
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m	295.2980
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune	245.6377
what is to be done asked dartagnan	63.3158
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle	2224.5623
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threateningly	1726.4122
it seems you must always be playing some game or other yes and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take	346.2356
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_ and he was recognized	630.2352
what doest thou here goodfornothing she said and why art thou not at notre dame i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazins permissionyou know mother monsieur bazin the vergeri came to speak to monsieur broussel and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	614.2717
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere	1922.7432
dartagnan did not know london he did not know a word of english but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the dukes hôtel	93.3412
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris	163.6182
give me the pocketbook la carconte and find a bag somewhere la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocketbook and a bag	427.9628
no but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for instance my dear little love in my country the ladies do without chambermaids	303.2143
well is all said all then lets count our money and divide it	36578.5547
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them	2569.2085
alas i understand think of the offense you have committed toward me madame it remains _here_ said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly	529.1501
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscienceand the mob retired	382.6427
contact the foundation as set forth in section below	231.9200
theres what you want on that table said the waiter	726.0250
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl	24.7227
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door	340.0117
half a million said he magnificent half a million is it said the major	410.3206
we will grow old together and talk of our companions no replied dartagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin i wish to be there i expect to get something by it what do you expect to get why i expect to be made marechal of france ha ha cried porthos who was not completely taken in by dartagnans gasconades	239.3607
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur dartagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority	321.9755
what happened to the worthy captain he died fell into the sea no sir he died of brainfever in dreadful agony then turning to the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail all hands obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines	2475.1575
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	152.8056
then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydée is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes because my lord said haydée eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to knowhow she had become the slave of the count	544.8718
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oftrepeated assurance of the _concierge_ that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	808.7149
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction	450.2067
but have the kindness to give the abbé busoni i told you he was not at home repeated the valet	280.3854
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes mr felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest you will hear me to the end my lord	1976.6024
counting his treasures replied the governor	205.2628
explain yourself more clearly i beg sir oh make yourself easyi am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean	1108.9750
milady continued one day our doors will ope with god come our desire and if betrays that hope to death we can aspire this verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer	1205.2104
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before her	448.3528
as we pass from one room to another i will open the windows to let you breathe monte cristo had already seen the breakfastroom and the salon on the ground floor	171.5544
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror	721.5928
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was fernand that of my betrothed wasstay stay continued the abbé i have forgotten what he called her mercédès said caderousse eagerly	536.6965
yes if it isnt contrary to the rules oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling	374.8885
athos invited dartagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve	284.1072
dartagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy	8469.2969
but apropos you belong to the fronde do you not madame i serve the king yes in your own way my way is the way of all gentlemen and i know only one way answered athos haughtily	272.4183
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château dif he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	363.5629
he was alonealone with these countless these unheardof treasures was he awake or was it but a dream	11606.9766
in england the post was well served	1155.8925
now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory you have found that out have you my lord	949.2642
no be assured i am not mad	71.4385
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother	131.8357
the gratitude of anne of austria	2.0770
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king himselfremember my lordthe king himself opposed it yes and france is about to pay for her kings refusal with a war	702.6897
some wine said athos on perceiving the host	133.9570
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	1354.0669
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery	367.6952
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	1367.9471
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand	273.7071
if anyone comes call me i will lieutenant said the soldier	709.9487
were you present during the last struggle asked m	492.0380
it is certainly the king said the man rising again	456.1518
dartagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber	498.9818
i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the th of september and that i am the son of the procureur m	56.3751
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion	255.7660
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it	571.5554
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m	743.3677
on the th a yacht will wait for you in the port of bastia it will be called the _eurus_	213.3280
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the window	485.5340
everything was here arranged in perfect order each register had its number each file of papers its place	8512.7900
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort levêque	698.6360
i have now been six years with m	81.9726
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his armchair	619.4704
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me	702.6613
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	568.0020
patience athos you are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be riddled	1140.5900
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him off he has said it and will do it tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not dartagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them now sire resumed aramis listen to me	266.3969
m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	2408.7388
and you hang it said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with you i must go away with you	108.9223
captivity the fourth day chapter lvi	2769.6189
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	428.3056
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastilewhere he remained for twelve long yearswhen his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court	468.6604
neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more	306.8833
m she then turned towards the avenue	133.0673
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject	62.6699
ha ha ye romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city	14408.5459
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all	315.0019
de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action	513.5740
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf	1078.8260
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	1220.5928
did i tell you that i wouldnt serve any other	1578.6051
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and fortyeight hours to stay there that makes three weeks	986.9962
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m	3825.6333
for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to the end of the world very well tomorrow sir i shall rely on it	52.3347
order of the king he said	31.6054
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection	12060.1533
now for the wager we listen monsieur athos yes the wager said the lighthorseman	1601.0975
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	240.6303
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	579.2653
ten minutes later the curate of st sulpice was announced	604.8573
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and castoff cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master	719.4561
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de boisrobert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me i have no doubt of it said dartagnan	712.5092
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for all dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what isabring right and left among the bedouinscan have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels	549.2443
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man	910.3485
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder	220.4828
franz dépinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy	647.4484
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	2241.6975
today he said with an efforttoday the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtiers room where he had seen him the preceding night	880.0626
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark	1018.3093
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left	644.0804
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie	201.0050
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these words there appeared in noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine	350.3499
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the lawthese advocates to promote your majestys welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	568.1588
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars	106278.5938
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending	275.1667
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	254.0223
noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her	327.8794
the scaffold will be ready by tomorrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after tomorrow what then said the king	155.2478
the dailyrenewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeera service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy	475.2710
would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him	387.4272
take him out and shoot him the prisoner turned pale	123.0336
dartagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration	1408.3929
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	592.9847
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette	15721.3818
they fire like grooms said porthos	34.5694
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall	4980.0396
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved and if you wished to die you would choose this death count yes morrel extended his hand	480.0183
no a more material interest stirred his blood	12506257.0000
ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle	3935.5364
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge	2965.9346
i have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas	319.7311
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms	103.9709
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count	530.7328
the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price	346.7563
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen anne looked at dartagnan anxiously	1012.2988
then the diamond is safe said he timidly	2840.5288
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service	116.6360
m general dépinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	378.3326
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kittys in bringing it but at the first words she read she became livid	1333.1656
may i congratulate you the affair is still in projection and he who says in projection means already decided said debray	631.3087
de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heartbroken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent	227.5437
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices	699.6746
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment	336.7440
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier said she	209.8049
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it	83.3532
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman	419.8730
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest	981.1541
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and dartagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling	221.2545
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney	279.9032
now as dartagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his	610.1021
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily i am not the queen	184.7365
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m	533.3354
oh dartagnan my beloved dartagnan you have come then at last you have not deceived me it is indeed thee yes yes constance	148.8412
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible i will try to accompany you said aramis though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback	99.5852
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door	558.0812
they will have nothing to do then at this end said mordaunt	64.5629
they have been speaking of my marriagehave they not yes replied the angry look	1089.3325
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready	1839.7491
well at a few minutes to seven at a few minutes to seven cried la ramee cold sweat upon his brow	148.8338
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps	427.5995
if on the contrary i die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man	1683.4777
it was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died and what did you do then what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	76.0904
the lady with the red cushion produced a great effectfor she was very handsomeupon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon dartagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady	646.1195
the three windows were still untenanted	3826223.0000
it was mercédès leaning on her sons arm and leaving the house	165.4982
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future	286.1726
fortunately dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth	314.1967
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him	1300.0022
oh the train is well laid the plot is clever	20948.9219
de villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following him	1221.1528
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m	123.2621
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch	328.6082
at ten oclock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the kings guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel	833.8784
peste if he is giving away hats like that porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment tomorrow	1943.1781
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment	640.8395
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong monte cristo opened the tortoiseshell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition	904.3247
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can	273.9194
has he taken off his doublet on the contrary everything is in the kitchen	127.3635
you should have allowed me to sleep	29.9526
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal	38.5611
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host goodnight and mounted the stairs	976.5389
we and his majesty will lead the second	155.6667
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal the coadjutor started	111.0905
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry reascended to his wifes chamber and found dartagnan just recovering his senses	430.8774
the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of to francs	721.4617
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father	396.9905
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage	476.4289
ah said aramis but you forget the officer dartagnan grew pale with rage	247.3754
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades	451.1456
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of albert de morcerf	130.4067
certainly said monte cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise i would not fight with m	349.5361
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos	76.4127

de morcerfs murmured mercédès and since he has been here i have watched him well well he has taken nothing yet the count is very temperate mercédès smiled sadly	312.4622

the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage	118.6362
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees	190.7495
oh my god who could have said so the evening before	129.3523
the procurators wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived	480.9281
coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk	817.0567
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice	304349.7188
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	466.6208
yes the rolling of a carriage it is the one my brother sends for us oh my god come come courage the bell of the convent gate was sounded milady was not mistaken	345.3234

nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmonds time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them	453.4996
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light	1435.8663
your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is porthoss purse too he put it into his pocket	3345.6221
dartagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief	3525.9187
the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey	247.1891

i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses	272.0755
there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move	352.5744
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late you see said athos pointing to mme	134.9687
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	548.8591
dartagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not come	159.2066
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his doublet	479.0769
oh exclaimed morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be listen said the count	201.3990
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism	56394.1484

de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers the countess made no reply	123.3098
alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort	1185.6652

the clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening	887.0327
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the threenone other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and shell soon tell us where her money is it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling	4489.8711
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst dartagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left	96.8432
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game	7363.1880
he placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	1401.4238
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced	574.3399
where were they taken asked athos	33.8608
listen i am already upon the scent resumed dartagnan	528.2854
night came dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken	198.4393
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	5078.1992
at this movement mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight	346.3637
he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living	1024.1353
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as dartagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time	323.7793
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time mme	171.1288
the worthy mercer had immediately upon reentering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit	950.2678
does the letter contain anything valuable demanded the host after a few minutes of useless investigation	3112.9626
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man	184.2454

yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads	18021.5762
chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person	183.4651
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another	10006.2881
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limetrees	11142.7402
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself	231.4749
i cannot be mistaken there are your horses the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage my dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window	1148.7040
who is this young person m	285.1956
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please	219.6533
this account confirmed that of the mayor	480.2787
do you find yourself badly lodged sister	156927602458624.0000
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance	324.4239
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned	1136.7334
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousses glass and do not interfere with us yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah but the meansthe means said fernand	1233.6494

sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy that cannot be sire said the earl	403.4523
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five oclock our little cabinboy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our direction	932.2004
i as a philosopher should like a little countryhouse a cottage down there under the trees without so many freestones over my poor body	1427.7261
de villefort is here well he comes to fetch his wife and daughter why so because madame de saintméran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m	154.7522
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps	3577.2451
the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner	95.2998
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	108.8349
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor	304.0132
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	5918.7109
that will insure his confidence athos smiled	1339.7039
haydée said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour	134.0807
bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him	2356.2615

see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them	1076.1744
this fortress was his post as kings attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition	1942.9132
at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal	2245.3701
there was no fear of her falling asleep	2257.6382
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you the devil said dartagnan whom the positive tone of m	310.7803
as dartagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends he held out his hand to the wounded man and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches	72.1969
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy it drives me to despair said fernand	294.7117
let us return to the object that brings me here what that which brings you home to me	552.7526
there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son	689.4166
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m	89.6535
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity	345.2200
he could not see it but he _felt_ its presence	2408.2622
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone yes said dartagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison him good god to imprison him monseigneur	315.9165
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me	186.6443
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder	29.3959
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her	1693.2432

i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent i am not very clever at pretexts	565.5761
alack alack cried the cardinal a venetian glass oh my lord said dartagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian but what do you advise then asked mazarin trembling	846.6490
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step	2077.5530
dartagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now dont you think monsieur that woods are like churches how so planchet because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other but why did you not dare to speak aloud planchetbecause you are afraid afraid of being heard	422.2248
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maidservant	1351.2850
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain	538.7175
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	4149.7798
thanks dartagnan thanks cried aramis almost in a state of delirium	256.7572
the three young people were talking together	4556.4331
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary	5469.3364
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saintméran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	59.9288
milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion	532.6152
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels	400.2158
the young man was opening the door of the stable	9.4361
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse	260.2191
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship	879.0070
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbés dead body	1453.3287
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn	140.2964
i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment	991.4778
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur dartagnan say a great deal about them you know monsieur dartagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes	205.5261

my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	1396.8478

pronounce one single word muttered dartagnan and you are a dead man the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring	176.9197
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	3064.9900

grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring	137.9516
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy	2446.2253

i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment you are then a chemist somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis but for such a work you must have needed bookshad you any i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty wellchosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know	1023.2440
the explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared	4132.0210
i will then release you from all your promiseseven that of procuring my admission into the musketeers for before everything i wish to avenge myself beware young man cried tréville	3675.2007

speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wishi wish you to spare me the walk back to paris	132.5820
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	207.4552
however she offered the cardinal laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other	501.7976
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs	336.9970
you have done thisi hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees	51.9743
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because i am only twenty the young woman looked at him furtively	108.4444
but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not	203.4234
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop	106.5988
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriagewindow the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo	1140.2349
darling replied valentine has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words _wait and hope_ fac et spera footnotes the wicked are great drinkers of water as the flood proved once for all in	8899.9385

has the daughter of ali tepelini spoken the truth said the president	1391.9255
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	240.5011
my faith replied dartagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward dartagnan stood quite astonished	305.4281
i know him well there and what did the officers do four conveyed him away i dont know whereto the bastille or fort levêque	1353.3195
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	82.8199
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	190.7014
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two is monsieur aramis with dartagnan asked lord de winter	323.0827
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car	24535.3242
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient bertuccio bowed and left the room	182.6165
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	1086.2732
yesyour friend at least hopes so come upstairs with me and i will give it to you i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	78.1817
you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already	100.8309
the two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	2184.2959
the time and place are but illsuited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious	441.1462
dartagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal	7.4827
one must take the world as one finds it	2056.4031
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated	200.1713
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck	145.8188
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	664.9418
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m	260.2681
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating	1309.5211
it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand trévillean edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel	803.7878
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter	1280.1362
the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island	341.1283
i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dantès	171.2813
at other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb him	387.8150
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	122.7239
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him you demanded a favor said the baron suspiciously	1525.0267
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence	219.0270
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion	515.9682
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed	218.2820

you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager	408.5959

are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us	162.3773
under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without assistance really captain said dartagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french	544.1476
the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte daix	2104.1907
no nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them	4798.5933
de chevreusewho though exiled to tours and believed to be in that city had come to paris remained there five days and outwitted the policethe king flew into a furious passion	652.5750

what took place at portsmouth august felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand	1046.4297
what are you thinking of this evening bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage	117.3016
it is true the cardinal had been particularly illtempered	5455.7192
i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket yes madame i have that of the garter which king charles i	472.0748
can i do anything for you gentlemen asked the duke	46.6537
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	61.4104
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned	474.6065
de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor	669.8331

monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around	258.5330
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week	1468.4863
what is the matter monsieur said planchet	40.9765
de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this _give us_ sounded revolutionary in the deputys ears	3050.5845
i will have him come in if you really wish it athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back	144.5127
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone	1666.7860
this was alberts favorite lounging place	2518.4309
what am i to do nothing very difficult but what is it to repeat these signs monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked	356.4861

i have imparted it to no one but my god and that in my prayers i ask for no more	107.1468
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness which road asked the postilion in italian	1988.3508
but could i do with a million retorted the count	233.0937
noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more	590.7610
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything	1725.3671

terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry	239.1844
bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired	147.2864
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently	648.4498
in these caves the treasure is in the furthest a	444.5021
follow you cried bonacieux follow you at this hour where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance	208.3122

you tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to fail she will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce herself she is capable of anything or everything	402.9829
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing	516.8986
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as _cicerone_ to albert	625.4750
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars	1566.6639
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	4303.6055
this portion of the napkin was marked with half a barons crown and the letter h truly truly said madame danglars all my linen is marked thus monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine	3377.4492

they were only fit for a young man i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and i do not think they were dear	290.5985
de villefort and valentine at the same time	6.3156
is he afraid of me or of his father	256.5263
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the counts carriage stopped at the gate	127.6380

the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind	327.9112
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together impossible said dartagnan we are under mazarins orders i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like dartagnan and porthos	409.5623
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another	199.9224
tell me i beseech you what ails you cried dantès letting his chisel fall to the floor	1590.2020
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief	585.1770

morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us no no said m	132.2963

at length they arrived at the famous room	195.1435
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale	187.2879
explain yourself then noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentines hand	3463.4900
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	134.9948
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature dantès pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it	221.3910

yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal	542.1086

athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	3720.3564
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	239.6655

and driving the coadjutors carriage said the queen	36.5918

then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it	1036.9519
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	583.3716
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind dartagnan	573.5602
thank you dartagnan said comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your namethat i may mention it to the queen raoul was about to reply when dartagnan bent down to his ear	371.7769

many might take for their device the epithet _strong_ which formed the second part of his motto but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the _faithful_ which constituted the first	3254.0667
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	441.5659
dartagnan let me confess to you what ive been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes speak out answered dartagnan	1618.9198
the guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron	6697.9448

tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any illfeeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesyour father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them	1038.3348
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard	2656.2654
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night	124.8971
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin	1321.7902
when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without witnesses they looked at one another with an air which plainly expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation	247.6322
she is ill great god she is losing her senses while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt	207.5890
the prisoner glanced at the windowsthey were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither	912.7361
nogentbeautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment this caused a universal burst of laughter	526.9675
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lions skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time	2420.0107
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it dartagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you	96.1975
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	130.9067
yes but never with the same advantages said dartagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight very good very good said the voice	190.6597

all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	347.7664
some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct	42939.1641
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head	992.9758
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	2359.7695
i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless next daynext day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me	329.3463

lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	412.7940
i know what i wish to know follow me the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions	403.2076
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying broussel broussel halloo stop rascal cried dartagnan	56682.1289

oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder	293.9002
it was one of the results of mazarins niggardliness	62588.2891
come said athos heres another good servant	173.1894
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speechwhich embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be freeso fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and thisthis is my fortunenot chimerical but actual	1151.3197

but his majestys decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours dartagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it	7188.7656
still said barrois with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant if m	402.9645
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature	580.4460

the great are often ungrateful very true said dartagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which mazarin wore on his finger	108.0971
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	6071.0249
the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which morcerf had formed no previous idea	1242.4159
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are lost	334.4576

it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound has he been wounded then oh good lord what have i said you said that porthos had received a sword cut yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so and why so zounds monsieur because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back	387.8475

that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans oh may god keep me from it and you too said dartagnan	1569.0459
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni	225.0522
you provide in accordance with paragraph a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work	98.6553

because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance dantès smiled	950.1577
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us francs for it	194.9777

so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it	841.2537
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter	93.7344
i shall find many men as able as you are i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	286.8871
noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	655.6879
nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawingroom astonishment was at its height	344.9145
is he still amusing himself in italy i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely	1091.1194
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years	221.7144
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office	502.7127
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king	903.4296
embrace also our good and brave porthos	1000.3087

the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii	3483.9666
madame said villefort i ask where is m	907.9785
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind	1162.5765
come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain lecleres instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	936.7659
he opened a window and leaned out to listen	213.0727
all the ladies rose and there was a profound silence	87.6266
mademoiselle eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel	2149.2803
of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are mademoiselle eugénie danglars and mademoiselle louise darmilly	3612.5466
some of the men moved toward them	96.7076
good thought gondy she is going to yield she is going to have him killed said dartagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me	92.3734

de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried dartagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from me he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m	1026.8849
well have you any news athos asked	824.3419
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind	788.4212
then it is for today asked the king	38.0029
lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her	119.9162
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her dartagnan would have returned home since he had so promised	152.7460
gramercy who would ever have thought it dartagnan only sighed	289.0247
m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions	2840.3445
i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs	31956.3633
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned dartagnan	73.4806
porthos my friend said dartagnan dont distrust providence let me meditate and consider meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn	3672.8669
it was then three oclock in the morning	9.9208
come comegive it to me what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand	71.5485
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only trifles that was his favorite word	1103.1034
alas you have purchased it dearly enough dartagnan left athoss chamber and went to that of porthos	1581.9176
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains	7324.9956
dartagnan and the englishman chapter xxxi	3513.3247
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat	865.3549
read then for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause	390.4089
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle	695.3624
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered my poor girl you know him already i know him yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her son the count of monte cristo the same ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine the friend of madame de villefort it cannot be surely valentine you are mistaken no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited	212.9814
i will no longer detain you m	55.6717
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver	1156.1830
he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house	74.9963
m certainly he said your receipt is money oh dear yes and if you were at rome the house of thomson french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done pardon me count pardon me then i may keep this money yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair	196.5050
tréville was one of these latter	46101.6758
thats a daring rascal whispered the count	9.6312
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers	664.4803
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten oclock	695.1754
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	132.2036
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street	261.7138
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz	148.8380
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior	733.1467
after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate	461.7894
quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair	48.3502
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy	14586227.0000
lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose	1062.5791
léon darmilly twenty years of age profession artist hair black eyes black travelling with his sister capital how did you get this passport when i went to ask m	3829.5574
sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you speak out my friend i am afraid to do so	188.2944
you cannot understand the position we are in	81.5907
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	949.5190
with one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet fifty feet responded dantès almost terrified	970.6083
the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless	2568.1050
there he said is our road the deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis	150.3240
stop i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	881.5410
i dreamed that i saw you lying bleeding wounded in the left side was it not and with a knife interrupted buckingham	1053.8225
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear	948.4453
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	3847.4141
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts	290.8084
i am not so much at liberty as you suppose on the contrary i have a most important engagement ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse	314.1101

thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice livres per annum from the day i was married	750.4104
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it	710.7711
you are right father i understand you then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for methanks morrel caught his hand	137.3290
now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence	106.4134
the court of saintbernard has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners	1204.3148
the letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected	8369.8125

yes said porthos but there are the equipments that is very true	117.4503
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolnesssuch qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of dartagnan they attracted his admiration	1978.0535
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards oh no of course not	1134.9396
de saintméran madame de saintméran m	505.9950
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his fathers honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms	103.7054
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve i understand said athos smiling midnight about that time but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return if you do not return how does it concern you	401.6713
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud	1260728.3750
during our expedition to béthune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow	570.8438
the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood	1629.3268
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of dartagnan and athos	3553.0408
yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife	465.4055
the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m	8505.4697
at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means	615.5545
yes and without violence said louise	805.7580
monsieur said mademoiselle daubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voitures friends	262.2929
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education	7060.4878
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse mehe is inflexiblehe will never pardon me	911.1202
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king	412.5014
the rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis	430.7262
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	755.9812
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it	44.8060
why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table	910.8483
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracya storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne	752.8583
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	95.9271
dartagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times	3570.5476
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved methat i have given nothing to that gallant officer dartagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	334.4298
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton	161.4913
time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner	460.7530
come let me show you my plan the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape	746.4523
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them	439.1497
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace	415.3638
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort	665.5789
oh good lord said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you	29.6964
the young lady went towards madame morrel	334.0529
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlés or fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure worldling murmured the count	439.5186
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour	279.1176
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts	314.1090
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv	234.0375
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime	390.3476
he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	613.3146
grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine oclock in the morning having a fair wind our frenchmen set foot on their native land	344.0811
i cannot cry at my age they say that we have no more tearsstill i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping	202.7971
dartagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him	89.0730
but this vessel which like the _pharaon_ came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the _pharaon_	999.4000
we dispense with your saying grace grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive	7301.7915
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him	199.4865
that you may be sure said the gascon means something they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it	688.5404
maximilian morrel captain of spahis at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks	2807.4612
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creaturefrom the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guardsfrom that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firinglet off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms	2011.7102
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs but he rid himself of all his spanish shares	489.5732
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance	471.1451
who was it you were talking with over there she asked	980.1049
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunessomeone by whose side he might weep	800.9451
there was no time to lose	176.7961
you have no right to put me to death alone	192.3176
a horse slips and injures a joint a horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone a horse eats out of a manger in which a glandered horse has eaten	4954.3364
you see he has a truly royal escort ay theres no fear in the daytime but at night we redouble our precautions and what method of surveillance do you employ eight men remain constantly in his room the deuce he is well guarded then	17461.7305
this reasoning seemed to dartagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight oclock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate	355.0998
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he	244.1938
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself	11159.3721
well how is it with this madman exclaimed he turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host who came in to inquire if he was unhurt	145.3674
yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the count	1094.5059
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind	4210.5293
now of two hundred and fiftyone members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninetyone who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon	1320.5624
sdeath he cried with his gascon accent	70067.2891
what is his bearing mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth	112.3213
but consider dartagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	5819.6470
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	19.2722
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head	255.2339
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort	24.0571
morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw	925.5018
thomson french said he do you know this house monsieur m they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly	337.2917
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course	321.9837
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	128.8660
you never knew her eh madame who knows said athos	203.0112
