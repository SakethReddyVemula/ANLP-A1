the young girl hastily took the letter from him	417.9508
short and stout who is it they all asked together in a low tone	1484.8417
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for dartagnan to follow him	908.7603
planchet said dartagnan i am going out for all day perhaps	1778.7369
what would the abbé please to have	107.0853

bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said dartagnan	395.4905
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman a gentleman exclaimed athos	582.5983
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind	1141.9265

i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune	358.1468

athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea	1448.7615
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again	1091.7184

i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart	2678.3398
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrens children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to youfor had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself orno my poor mother i could not have killed her by the same blowi should have fled from my country dear albert said beauchamp	1862.8927

la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	3667.2563
nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind	1171.0194

then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god the presence of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses	1433.8287

you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title	2094.2817
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers	1269.6339
i do not think so added châteaurenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly	1524.2554

dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	1221.6373
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was	1043.2709

scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsars podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a halfdilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin	2413.0210

dartagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head	3237.6111
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs	910.1458
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest	1308.3546
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of francs he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying	3026.6367
now said he the sacrifice is consummated ah if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husbands chest m	2078.8513
deschamps place beauveau faubourg sainthonoré and you have my authority to inspect those deeds sir replied m	3766.3726
m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	1227.3765
it was in the rue des francebourgeois close to la force	11248.9023
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful could you have imagined this scene châteaurenaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract indeed no said châteaurenaud did you know her i spoke to her once or twice at madame de morcerfs among the rest she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy	2659.9832
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m	1079.6510
this door was a mockery to the _concierge_ from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_ opening at the _sesame_ of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	2177.6577
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become	654.5592
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine	4547.6294
this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over monsieur de condé and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified	2097.7729
however there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my lord indeed explain to me	1077.2161
how dartagnan and porthos earned by selling straw	8784.5977
let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to london and back	1272.7070
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was all	466.1173
ah you fellows are good managers you ride on our lackeys horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads	3033.7515
monsieur dartagnan sides with mazarin pardon my frankness dear friend	8252.4365
i will make planchet brush my boots and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate	959.1202
he arrived valentine was expecting him	213.2434
what the devil did you come to such a country for athos	789.8813
it must be nearly four oclock	7435.6094
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	1461.4164
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athoss aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athoss residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin	3186.0977
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried milady and a threatening glance darted from her eyes	2700.3506
dartagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it	1300.7611
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled	5042.1748
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door	843.5104
the moment for my escape is fixedseven oclock	3084.6516
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked dartagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england	2170.9270
no it does not concern me	110.0484
more than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourningcoaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot	3349.2869
it would be very kind of you no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be are we alone yes replied the count going to the door and returning	678.7703
and youwhat are you doing here replied dartagnan	1142.1199
is that she mamma asked eugénie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair yes said madame danglars that is she	3038.5522
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging mebesides i may not be there myself where at your ball why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that purpose you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments tell me what it is my mother begs you to come the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting	1290.0989
adieu raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy adieu sir adieu my beloved protector athos waved his handhe dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered	6770.5801
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared the count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish	1157.3684
those in whom the king has confidedlord levens highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once	1484.2937
then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused	1082.1663
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	2656.8279
madame de villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table	2011.7716
danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine oh such a dreadful thing that i dont dare to tell you always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile	1779.0211
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures	1339.2849
yes go go said she to her brother the effects _are_ drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them silence was reestablished	2402.7461
how will you prove continued the jesuit without allowing him time to speak that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to god	2331.4380
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the gravedigger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard	974.5563
what you dont know me no monseigneur well two words will refresh your memory	3875.2385
noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer	2549.1760
when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of assuntas chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old	1427.4667
bonacieux was the very life of dartagnan	83.4072
you know the vessel is lost the _pharaon_ sirthey signal the _pharaon_ the _pharaon_ is entering the harbor morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheardof fabulous facts	5791.1289
lord winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	1732.2496
no where i can confess but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul	1080.9821
dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you	419.2884
i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought dartagnan	941.8900
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered	876.2183
meantime he was going to try to find out milady	4555.2515
what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo	735.3093
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick	2492.7083
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before	5220.0674
the footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand dantès guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handbier	2484.8757
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise	728.6411
you are about to see said mousqueton looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold	2078.8850
the catacombs of saint sebastian chapter	28491.2109
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	3972.1646
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones	3801.5205
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing	2045.1963
morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box	1653.0234
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the dukes health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified whenever my lord pleases the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarterpast six	1590.1005
in the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless peoples minds were uneasy	18758.5176
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	1075.1455
the cardinal put it on in military style	5394.1846
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him	2389.5972
first and foremost dear dartagnan we have no title such as count here	1773.2163
de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour valentine shall come down into the drawingroom	3087.7390
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all i want oh muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him how misfortune humbles a man i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges	1326.5385
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	1720.3812
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort	1337.0675
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers	2891.4348
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house	1015.1358
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands	1321.9844
but dartagnan again shook his head	13850.6182
i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur dartagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery mazarin thought for an instant	1543.9056
disguised as a coachman exclaimed mazarin	16075.2432
of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccios story	820.0985
my whew thats a frightful place that bastille only to think of it makes my flesh crawl	2379.3699
he was a man between sixtysix and sixtyeight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes	7236.5713
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	2266.7358
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	924.9794
i persons whom i do not like yes indeed	4005.3770
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation	1241.5820
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of dartagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever	971.9751
vampa took cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained outside	2179.9912
the rumor of edmonds arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city	2685.7383
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	1980.8181
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de contis lieutenant	1697.5829
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced	1189.3939
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go the count rang and a footman appeared	1288.1036
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it	1029.1565
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk	2068.9897
where is he ill very ill say you	999.9500
she worries me everywhere said dartagnan	368.0649
in the name of heaven cried he listen to me i have been waiting for someone who has not come	723.4377
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked athos	2541.8567
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away	1235.2128
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	676.6968
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides	3189.4053
m our expedition made a favorable beginning	124727.9844
he could not see it but he _felt_ its presence	3472.4463
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears	3145.9919
that one yes the third the one in the dark blue coat yes he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform	610.8275
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein	6953.7764
that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman	731.0773
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate	1410.7952
i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner but to you i shall be merciful	958.9789
yes my lord well enough to question him in that language yes my lord question him then raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion	1465.4092
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer	1169.6879
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the executioner	1805.5964
he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others then he added monsieur you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my duty m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where villefort had left him	1729.2241
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert	390.3653
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards theres no use in thinking any more about athos	1893.9983
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded	2560.7351
the wounds that i make are better than thatwitness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles	4252.4736
the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires	2580.2261
you called me didnt you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table	1330.6906
yes if i am killed said albert laughing	2137.9324
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune dartagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them	1329.7461
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given	1748.6627
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	6107.7036
the name of dartagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty	1114.5652
be this evening about ten oclock at st cloud in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of m	677.1788
great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality	1113.6025
we are first said morrel looking out of the window	1439.5031
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing	8907.3252
noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild	1865.9020
i shall use it again upon occasion and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day dartagnan directed his course toward m	1091.6669
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul	1761.7416
the four old friends prepare to meet again	1350.5565
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father	1413.1901
its purple visage and its violetcolored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet	1689.2908
for the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchengarden	1592.3175
to the judgeto the judge madame it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame	1538.7278
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you ali bowed in token of strict obedience	3257.8860
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and dartagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written	897.5889
if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a birdofparadise	1483.6519
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister	3863.8428
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i cannot break	1274.8243
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear	2329.8555
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house	1469.1594
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dogs trick or other and that immediately said tréville	1506.9679
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine chapter lii	5558.4126
oh mon dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one why not because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird unfortunately that is true	1750.5398
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival	1724.5305
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it	949.5490
really i think the thing very difficult not at all cried dartagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary i think it very easy	1074.0847
for my part observed aramis i cannot say the same as you do porthos	644.1566
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons but i love her my lord and was jealous	1049.4863
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy ah said mazarin breathing more freely	3952.3379
morrel whispered what have you done to him i	186.7867
the man who lives to see shall see and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court	1656.9929
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection that is possible said the countess reflecting	2909.4641
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo	941.5442
the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction and that will not be long it is to be hoped said porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes	850.1776
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was dartagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	1091.6283
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dantès	2740.5242
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	991.5308
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while dartagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table	1239.3799
the people who wrote are anglogermans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	823.1846
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with manthat is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really donotunderstand youperfectly i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those officeholders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom god has put above those officeholders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to filli say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation	1636.2787
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table	5193.5161
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish	1661.6613
m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator	848.9914
b constance bonacieux or camille de boistracy silence monsieur once again silence ah since the dangers i incur on my own account cannot stop you think of those you may yourself run me yes there is peril of imprisonment risk of life in knowing me then i will not leave you monsieur said the young woman supplicating him and clasping her hands together monsieur in the name of heaven by the honor of a soldier by the courtesy of a gentleman depart there there midnight sounds that is the hour when i am expected madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus	1489.1918
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him	739.9048
cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	785.4231
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy	3443.9714
i dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a scheme	3405.9585
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by dartagnan all for one one for all thats well now let us everyone retire to his own home said dartagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal chapter x	1526.4447
and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it	1733.5941
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes	1396.9104

the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieuthe eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austriato declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter	787.8316

you shall soon have something to drink i give you my word if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of athos	1632.9341
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	330.7169
do you not remember him yes said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air	1671.2651
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone	10193.3643
i was mistaken said the host hes not quite dumb	10307.6494
they were both aroused at seven oclock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for dartagnan	1737.4563
for one second dartagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and dartagnan recognized the coadjutor	805.4034
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	451.7856
the young girls lover was in cucumettos troop his name was carlini	2118.9907
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste then cried franz it is hashish i know thatby name at least that is it precisely signor aladdin it is hashishthe purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandriathe hashish of abougor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these words _a grateful world to the dealer in happiness_ do you know said franz i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies judge for yourself signor aladdinjudge but do not confine yourself to one trial	1792.0869

the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back	3447.0701
de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day	1515.5989
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which dartagnan alone understood	1389.3984
teresa was sixteen and vampa seventeen	22571.1406
to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentines condition but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep	1970.8971
dartagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract	1043.6381
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks	1414.4164
the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery	2653.2336
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed	3386.4702

she found milady with a smiling countenance	20976.9297
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	509.4473
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day	855.0253
albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments	2173.3848
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed	7894.0195
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet	1634.1407
it must have been for his hide for _certes_ the carcass is not worth eighteen livres	2785.1550
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him	1693.5371
today yes bless me i quite forgot the races	5856.7002
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex	1905.0831
take it then and pray disturb us no longer said madame de villefort giving the album to edward who then went towards the door led by his mother	2384.3171
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de châteaurenaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf	5201.6353
besides courage was out of the question here dartagnan had fallen into an ambush	2309.8809
is it not true antoine asked the governor	3810.9111
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him yes your excellency andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	2023.5360
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	1761.0781
come said athos heres another good servant	15846.4990
you know the proverb unlucky at play lucky in love you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge	1806.4749
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen private interests are as nothing before the interests of all	1160.2544
_pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied dartagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air	828.5214
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made	1512.7960
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket	2441.7456
i must tell you resumed mazarin that it is in a double envelope i understand and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place just so take it and go	821.6494
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her	2420.3535
well said dartagnan one is never killed in a first engagement nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killedwell he will die bravely but holdshould such a misfortune happenwell athos passed his hand across his pale brow	1489.0206
i as a philosopher should like a little countryhouse a cottage down there under the trees without so many freestones over my poor body	4298.8188
i am cold i am hungry	140131.0312

we went by bologna perugia and rome ah yestrue mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought	5070.6016
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had dartagnan in her power that she was present at his execution and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips	1295.3317
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing	21658.3574
there are then francs for your share besides the you furnished me to begin with making in all francs for your portion	1313.2180
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals motive	3355.7134
nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	913.1323
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the sidegate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champsélysées	2302.3999
and driving the coadjutors carriage said the queen	458.2449
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man	1550.0961
hurry the horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the counts door	2468.1201
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven oclock struck	3828.5349
on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them	1525.7578
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office	2947.0410
as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning the owner did not wait for a second invitation	2009.8347
this was the last blow to the prisoner	162.6862
dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegrinder	1432.0815
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord	3967.8711
conclusion epilogue authors preface in which it is proved that notwithstanding their names ending in _os_ and _is_ the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them	1415.9611
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose	1399.7368
out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away	4946.7778
dartagnan looked with surprise at his friend	1050.5422
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor	1873.4640
two persons passed near meallow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel oh yes very gloomy my friend	1244.4865
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn	1614.3694
the soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages	1412.4417
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	1693.9167
go morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire	2964.1162
alas your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels what then amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv well in these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with the fattest among them cried dartagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing	2237.0056
do not fancy that i do you a favor i use either hand easily	2748.8350
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips	2591.9187
come said boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me perhaps he knows you though you do not know him m	1159.3037
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them	4197.7910
we must understand each other said the duke	388.1554
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abbé	1579.0914
m it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a halfcircle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglarsit is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly	1425.1061
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name	4638.0884
it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way if we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must start athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condéhas he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings	1920.7455
i am lost my god my god my god she knelt upon a cushion and prayed with her head buried between her palpitating arms	4130.2915
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected	4587.0137
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	1079.2109
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy	1244.0065
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead ofas is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedygoing home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrowis removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner	2284.4270
her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources	2801.1562
if only for the sake of m	98.1748
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle	5434.2158
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue	802.9811
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m	1101.5927
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent	1525.0573
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out	2663.6550
m but then you are richvery rich indeed continued debray taking out some papers from his pocketbook which he spread upon the table	4238.3799
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them	1945.5619
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	324.7180
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abbé smiled	2065.2539
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself	7950.7832
a sort of smile played on his lips	1349.2871
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	1101.5549
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair	1309.7959
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around and porthos heaved another sigh	1909.8973
it was time for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee	9957.4814
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell	1524.7366
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleepingchamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is bertuccio bowed	1441.5300
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep what not asleep said felton what is she doing then she has fainted	2419.6196
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	1500.5582
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	6409.4678
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention	4322.3203
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy	2785.7898

she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard all	1316.3420
then a voice reached them once more sending this threat to our next meeting sirs in england chapter xliv	9499.2217
noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orangepeel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo	1633.8953
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m	2427.6887

monsieur darminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation	2145.0200
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it	994.8882
on the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond studs	1433.9478
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north	4254.6763
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthoss opinion is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	2260.7676
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it meanthe _pharaon_ come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study	2169.0808
he vaulted hastily from his horse whilst planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house	2049.7449
upon my word you would make caesar afraid the matter is replied dartagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman and you complain of that said porthos	2456.6814
dartagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop	3203.5347
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	1789.3237
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off come added the king	3463.9524
and now said morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away will you not see my sister once more asked maximilian	2239.1357
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	846.9152
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by	2282.1428

the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	2514.8403

alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort	2419.5354
i was so delighted to see her again i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris for the cause which today takes us to england and what is this cause demanded aramis	1271.5715
my adored valentine words cannot express one half of my satisfaction valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier	2286.4092
as for me i will give my last sou for it	2557.5854
and then besides the useless blood never no never i have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it hush said dartagnan the some one is coming the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	1270.9102
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared	911.3957
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men	5162.9922

what hatred she distills motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme	2825.6833
it was however too late albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the bankers study	2230.5742

our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight	1499.9716
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it	1419.7667
in case i should be killed said de guiche	5661.2412

the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse	816.4951

he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette	12729.5713

whilst dartagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris	3460.4197

but andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking	3915.2837
a knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	1720.9761
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners sir replied dartagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks	2791.0671

unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut upcaptured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered	1346.8778
on his left was porthos whilst dartagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side	2240.0393

an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good	1365.5931
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	2109.0212
maximilian goes with _me_ said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brothers account once more farewell my dear sister emmanuel adieu morrel repeated	4681.3179

i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory	1205.2397
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted	2216.7288
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was dartagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you thank god thank god yes it is i said dartagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy	1209.1276
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side	3616.2212

my faith said dartagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to m	1487.4828
on the following morning at five oclock dartagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mothers recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor dartagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow	2614.9380
dartagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	1547.9496
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	1272.4607
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them	907.6244
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure three curates remainedthose of st merri st sulpice and st eustache	2477.9111
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek	1107.6838
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears	1603.3644
i would have saved madame de saintméran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living	1531.4132
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	848.9396
dartagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened	692.5187
is he still in a fit said the procureur	2509.5649
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done mordaunt bowed humbly	1324.4407
see said the count how very ungrateful women are	9066.0010
the name of your ship inquired dartagnan	1068.3909
each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth	2781.8606
a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity	7063.1006
dartagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat	1605.2386
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside	2151.7412

did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter yes davrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation	2694.6897
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china	2146.6121
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback	1706.4788
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile	1418.1713
with such a _vade mecum_ dartagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait	2202.6611
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot	1556.8726

it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty	4873.3511
how would you like to have it	70.0049
they halted for the king to dine	2062.9695
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations	2533.8540
father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	1203.6902
it was only a way of speaking	565.9827
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him	2037.9884
dartagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth	2426.3589

ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho	1871.1927
albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge	1999.7999
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house	2573.8423
why for him and not for me	98.5902
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air	1093.4835

he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner	1246.8159
have you seen the king yes and all goes well we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven it was then striking halfpast ten by st pauls	1760.3234

however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death be easy said dartagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead	1805.2521

he soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	5681.5669
i am taken shouted athos with all the power of his lungs	613.7462
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be	1534.8396

while he was doing this dartagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared	2338.1936
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum ah sir you know well i would risk my life for you thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet	3179.3381

dartagnan believed this cough to be a signal	1159.7218
there goes one cried athos at the end of five hundred paces	2315.5403
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart	1548.8481
the hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence	1956.6190
hark said she we have been overheard someone is coming all is over we are lost no said felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard then run to the door and open it yourself felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul	1535.1499
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieuxcolombier resembled a camp from by six oclock in the morning in summer and eight oclock in winter	2592.1326
from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window adieu dear friend oh i cant let you go so i will go with you and he took his sword and cloak	813.3375

sit down my dear friend and let us talk and aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which dartagnan stretched himself out	2289.6453
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it the marquis of saintméran returned the count	743.8605
and when did he set out yesterday evening planchet my friend interrupted dartagnan you are really a precious fellow you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone	1847.4985
de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess	1376.2911
m dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	1001.5639
nothing could be better done a sundial could not have shown the hour with greater precision	2330.4675
wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out no positively i will not go	2234.2085
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said dartagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant	596.3704

will you take me away with you	51.6926
the king has nothing like it no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin	1017.8423

my arm and my life belong to you like my love then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving she stopped	1069.9764
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	3772.7319
you ought i say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman	1523.2207
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter	1575.7751
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in dartagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected	1938.0369
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker his banker	987.7834
the snow was falling thick and icy	1640.5771
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus	2006.9110
_certes_ cried athos you are the bestmounted poet of france or navarre well my dear aramis you dont want three horses	3605.8484
we will arrange the matter rather better	88100.3984
aramis saluted then turning toward athos i dont care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said	1454.2501
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket	4826.6450
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm	1115.9633
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you	18252.7988
dartagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	1750.2461
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance	3538.9187
oh now i may say so so much the better replied monte cristo as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you	1112.3060
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you	1326.0742
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent	635.0449
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands	1666.2480
behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them and dartagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty	1142.6406
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something but why mother just to please me albert said mercédès	4350.4292
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and davrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayhe is mad but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	2471.0051
but you only asked francs for a fowl we have a fixed price for all our provisions	1139.0007
it was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave paris by night had been circulated	1344.4696
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is i have gained francs by the sale of them	1236.0271

i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you	586.4396
franz dépinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron dépinay by charles x the same said villefort	1814.3748
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon	2491.0779

he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	3492.7925
the evernew passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death	2288.8997
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the seafowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels	1544.8910
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive meyes or no saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans	1533.6157

i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole	2159.0117
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen	7272.6099
among worldly people manner is contagious	32733.0664

dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	2050.8535
