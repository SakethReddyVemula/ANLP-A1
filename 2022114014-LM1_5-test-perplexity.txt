i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments i am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good french for i resided three years in paris then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man nearly	340.4543
he dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly away	1100.8182
faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death	714.1143
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself	317.8968
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo	447757.7812
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peaceoffering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame	1467.8219
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt	153.5218
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived	63.1204
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized yes yes i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party	242.0136
and dartagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected	11737.1230
the president looked at his auditors	59080.7266
it is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and place	1360.8777
i spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks and the prince was pleased with you he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken	88.0275
the door had been opened and shut again the mercers pretty wife had disappeared	576.9294
already up raoul exclaimed the count	6.2497
sir said davrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentines maid if you please villefort went himself to find her and davrigny approached noirtier	1056.3597
although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them	2684.3926
that concerns your majesty more than me said the cardinal	51.6842
it is of an original color said aramis i never saw one with such a hide in my life i can well believe it replied dartagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him	134.1010
i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged villefort cast a gloomy look around him	424.8148
aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for mme	2807.2817
the queen looked at him surprised	5307938816.0000
but why do you ask i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know	43.4138
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert	1717.6090
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it	1060.9443
when arrived there the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all	488.7461
noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character	419.9082
well what is the matter the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment	73.8967
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for threefourths of that city known as the capital of the world	682.8744
in a moment you didnt forget my purse no be easy good porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post	258.1403
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking nevertheless or find some one else continued dartagnan turning his back	190.9607
now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and cannot be legally exercised the notary then prepared to retire	521.4325
he leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon	276.9644
the door is opened to all who knock	34571.1641
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	998.9197
i have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmentwo classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other but the secret said dartagnan	4781.7407
de tréville looking earnestly at dartagnan	86.3970
i will allow myself to die with hunger come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that	337.6766
he was an italian and therefore superstitious	17983.3770
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste	2818.4143
this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not nearly so well monsieur do you know who this great lady is no i have heard porthos speak of her thats all do you know who this pretended duchess is	144.2309
have i not been there once yes but at that period we were not at war	162.8789
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god	411.8481
well how much for the equipments if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty porthos made a sign of assent	208.0037
read me her letter oh my lord said laporte	333.2682
dartagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting	585.2331
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen	423.3938
let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for i always understood you were a bachelor that was the general opinion sir said the major and i yes replied the count and you confirmed the report	376.1306
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand	22231.8906
yes my poor girl replied morrel i come to bring and to hear bad tidings this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious	670.0391
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened	455.9052
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so no replied the count i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio but you might have shown more confidence in me i your excellency yes you	582.3406
no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word and who thus designated it the king himself the king i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics	284.7639
dartagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired	1277.4452
franz dépinayand she shall marry him valentine sank weeping into a chair	1643.3613
_pardieu_ cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa	301.4732
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole	436.2286
close the door said la carconte i do not like open doors when it thunders particularly when there is money in the house eh answered caderousse doublelocking the door	808.4570
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon	140.8155
whose then is the air we breathe	1827.6732
bonacieux darting to the window can it be he milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss	538.9073
étienne soon returned from his errand	75223.2891
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself	223.0097
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that dartagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queens letter and for which he had repaid m	378.3062
zaccones youth the fathers no the sons i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade was he in the wars i think he entered the service in what branch in the navy are you not his confessor no sir i believe he is a lutheran a lutheran i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him	470.7532
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocketmoney he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewelboxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there	1666.5079
report to the king the condition of affairs	1440.5522
do you remember me said he to the host who advanced to greet him	135.4939
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	7214.4590
de monte cristo has only shown us kindness	4151.4185
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up thats all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers	536.5450
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but i cant be severe with him he is really _so_ bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m	927.8906
wait what are you going to do asked aramis	27.1954
this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rosecolored glass	6938.2427
well have you any news athos asked	456.6103
oh yes yes be assured i shall save you besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before do not mistake i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure	225.8719
i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me	1425.0219
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit	3126.8279
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was mad	559.3133
i go said he i go at once how you will go said mme	88.3323
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend	374.4076
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope	433.6782
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays	4713.3750
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper	127.5342
the two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst	146.7561
well as he means to enter the church at the same time as myself he does not despair of becoming pope in his turn or at least a cardinal	115.4516
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care	397.7020
ah he is not a man like that cursed dartagnan	279.7669
dartagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground	84.5981
compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her	491.2374
arrived at the hotel it was not long before athos entered	79.1775
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc dangoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	687.1035
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of the servants yes replied noirtier	129.0523
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets thats because they dont see us said athos	1293.5953
look here resumed dartagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges the devil said porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that do you hear interrupted dartagnan become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the counts place in everything and he jingled his money	416.4172
what the devil captain one cannot win all ones battles the great pompey lost that of pharsalia and francis the first who was as i have heard say as good as other folks nevertheless lost the battle of pavia and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword said aramis for mine was broken at the first parry	629.6323
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse politeness you simpleton retorted la carconte	112927.3047
danglars informed you of the ceremony oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety well said monte cristo you are fortunate m	339.7068
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated	2020.4141
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis dor to go and drink his health with their four other comrades	1753.5784
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it meanthe _pharaon_ come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study	303.4922
we chased him for six hours and when he was near being takenwhen st simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the _halali_crack all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a twoyearolder	3279.4885
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going	146.0620
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	2423.6345
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets	198.3620
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you	492.8096
call madame de villefortwake madame de villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave	222.9568
there he stopped breathless and panting	10908214.0000
now will you make me a report of all that has happened why i have related the events to you	101.5977
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had	256.3016
judge if i should not put myself under its protection flattery was at that period very current and m	1312.2834
certainly if miladys strength had been equal to her hatred mme	3091.3630
of what country are you asked the prince	38.3337
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	307.6618
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentines room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a bloodred color	622.9361
you are monsieur dartagnan you see monsieur that you say it again but i tell you monsieur commissary cried bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter	83.3773
bah said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love	186.0112
do you wish to go to m	28.4841
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies dartagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocationwhence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard	1184.1261
yes i received the news this evening by a courier	213.3089
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	1429160.6250
dartagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard	150.0079
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with such a heart as yoursand such a swordone passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed	1025.9937
religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions	4173.1196
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st leu being not far from that locality	408.2830
but i will take the left handit is my custom in such circumstances	1710.0660
well asked the queen well madame replied the valet i followed them as far as the gates	53.2075
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	185.5602
oh god prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead oh god murmured the girl leave me my mother your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning around	699.3567
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor	2692.3945
no sir and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you a glass of wine will be extremely welcome the fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the gascon to porthos	772.3891
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done dartagnan but perhaps you have been wrong dartagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	140.3953
these three musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone	57.3685
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone i suppose not	125.6477
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	428.1397
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressingroom	515.8558
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant	155.1998
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain	150.2488
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	119.1398
i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself	427.7227
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack	583.0310
then believe me it will be time to act yes we will wait	57.1602
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are and you asked joannes	366.6891
its a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all but i do have you made inquiry is there any need of that does not his appearance speak for him	206.3282
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition	525.4034
she is ill great god she is losing her senses while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt	247.3198
well my faith he shall see how a gentleman can die the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically	479.8790
well but cant you speak come monsieur porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton	1183.2930
he wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hôtel	667.1008
the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill milady yes milady it is true you called her thus what has the monk to do with this milady she was his mother grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner	271.0622
had you then that sum the queens famous diamond answered dartagnan with a sigh	269.7200
monseigneur replied porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe and you what have you done monsieur porthos i have won five pistoles of aramis well now will you return with me we are at your eminences orders to horse then gentlemen for it is getting late the attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the bridle	215.7670
dartagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared	332.9227
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet wellpitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum	1774.0781
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least what is that did you observe dartagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton no but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles forget them for a time we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground do you think that likely no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it you reconcile me dartagnan well then assume a cheerful manner as i do we must joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we cant corrupt them	664.3593
dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort	104.6577
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur dartagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority	445.8673
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman	351.5904
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death	632.6319
he proposed to fernand to accompany him fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general	771.2217

when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès	248.2705

planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded madeleines brother entered dartagnans service	1642.2921
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante your emotion has quite overcome you his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear	591.9397
do you not remember him yes said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air	365.3940
you are at home said he	14.1357
the fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos	830.6872
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas	3562.3135
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellowcountrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor destiny destiny murmured the abbé	3333.9297
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort	112.5029
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence	200.4686
at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	497.7596
return to greenwich and bring them here	112.0436
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment	1102.8840
the four friends saw all thisnot a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them	10175.3760
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks	293.4500
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay	144.2773
i am monsieur du poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincennes mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that dartagnan and porthos should give place	170.9419
for women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me	983.9108
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him what did you refuse to dine with him said old dantès and did he invite you to dine yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son	193.7196
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door	329.8652
davrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act	92.0994

the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges	4385.8008

scarcely however had he touched edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house	213.0855

he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine	314.9919

morrel attributed penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the _pharaon_ longer	1212.1548

whilst they pursue him the king might escape it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him what do you think of this counsel winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him	157.0720
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme	487.2675

the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	1784.8406

mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	478.5315
but its of no importance continued dartagnan with natural assurance its of no importance	3187.7966
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the periodmeanness stinginess fasts but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurators wife had been tolerably liberalthat is be it understood for a procurators wifehe hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind	2676.1606

it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another	199.3056
it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	381.8868
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only halfaroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake	480.3842
the young lady went towards madame morrel	578.6318

i do not know but he wishes to speak to you ah said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult i do not think that such is his intention said morrel	65.7794
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss	1553.5547
you were asking then said the host in spanish	348.8598
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary	16699.5957

but to you at least m	363.9695
tis well and may this money profit you adieu i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other the abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming	2358.5930
m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the counts box	424.7575
dartagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but dartagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it	238.2849
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said dartagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick dartagnan	133.9612

morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly	23455.1016
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran halfscared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person	1784.1666
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair	142.1977
de saintméran said madame de villefort then this house belonged to m	82.4012
oh that is no impediment sir said she i have had greater men than you arrestedguitant mazarin sprang forward	339.3939
de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air	730.1151
you are now master of england i was much more really so two hours ago how so general because england had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken	478.7526

well the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the guard	364.0508
his next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap	2539.0112
thats lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders	1.0239
no but franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before him	150.7535
penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain	697.8666
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the summit	852.7988
it was seven oclock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place	54.6896

so said charles he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere sire said aramis	155.0265
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	2208.1885
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m	425.6228
we anchored our vesselwhich had a double hold where our goods were concealedamidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rhône from beaucaire to arles	1589.0249

bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys	204.5558
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch	206.5686
he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes	102.8658
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan m _ma foi_ said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for i feel eagles wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in fourandtwenty hours ah yes the hashish is beginning its work	379.9567
she had laid that down the preceding evening	113.0402
the queen had confidence in the courage of dartagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced	71.9078
jesus dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of malta as timid as a young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors well then said groslow bring them with you but really said dartagnan	406.4128

the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by miladys pulse that the case was not serious	537.7722
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	10975.1885
how could i then return to brussels	194.0226
my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness go up said the host she is still in her chamber athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat	402.1951
one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selims flaming lance	4861.3101
we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said albert but to demand an explanation the young mans trembling voice was scarcely audible	2426.6018
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard	4354.1567
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master	129.3461
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	220.5687
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated them	2715.6650
but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain dartagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an explanation	220.9822
now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter you are right it was left on board then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio no and what did you do with this same letter while returning from portoferrajo to the vessel i carried it in my hand so that when you went on board the _pharaon_ everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand yes danglars as well as the rest danglars as well as others now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest	311.5385
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished	479.8369

the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy	211.3041

the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an underjailer illclothed and of sullen appearance	3793.0212
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and châteaurenaud	182.1715
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied	1402.2012
giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility dantès proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop	771.4347

certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and i can set out immediately when you like raoul sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince and you ought to thank her raoul	166.8841
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed dartagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way dartagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock	250.2598
my head feels actually cold said porthos	36.0800
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	231.7510
m adieu i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristoand certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses	826.4037
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room	134.9140
you think then said he that i am taken to the château dif to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m	262.6187

is she going to fall in love with me by chance this fair inconstant and will she be disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me for de wardes dartagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to miladys	472.1160
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and doublelocked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure	363.5825

the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him	638.8823
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late oh no answered franz i had no such intention and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle i might have done so from monte pincio could i not ah exclaimed mine host i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves very possibly i may not go answered franz but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars of todays executions what particulars would your excellency like to hear why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to die that happens just lucky your excellency only a few minutes ago they brought me the _tavolettas_ what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment	825.9720
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied	897.5962
he had not done so for ten years before	51.9076
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	88.3282
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber	945.5688
in passing before dartagnan he recognized his former master	212.7634
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us my dear friend you guess well	535.2934
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell	486.9272
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject	76.3578
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes	116.0094
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions	757.1981
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me and what shall i say to the people that they must have patience said anne as i have the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out	135.8943
the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _lucia di lammermoor_ supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy	1619.7415
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples	409.9912
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous	44511.4922
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	350.8575
there came in moreover two drafts which m	11961.8506
they had not seen him for two days	48.4644
noirtier rue coqhéron no paris now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address noirtier repeated the abbé noirtieri knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruriaa noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution what was your deputy called de villefort the abbé burst into a fit of laughter while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment	423.0132
why oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain with spain no answered dartagnan but paris what do you mean cried rochefort	292.8062
now then all is agreed let us go down you are going into the garden yes go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it excellent thank you and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	511.4081
groslow said aramis the devil who is this groslow asked porthos	229.1541
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss	1348.4086
dartagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything i will answer for nothing	213.8107
comminges villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men	538.6073
the king entertained great regard for my father who had fallen at the siege of arras and the uniform was granted	132.1025
this was simply because he lived in the hôtel	65.2188
unfortunately edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular	509.4206
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo	58.7057
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also	21336.8145
you would then be in present possession of the letter	98.2545
your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and i advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal why i am ready to tell everything cried bonacieux at least all that i know	198.6669
is it not so father the old man made a sign in the affirmative	28.7602
occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen	103646.5000
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself adieu gentlemen said de comminges sleep well we will try de comminges went away dartagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted	468.5494
miladys secret dartagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kittys chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to doand that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this woman	421.5587
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling	699.5601
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts	301.6695
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	618.1252
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond	68.4256
cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars asked beauchamp	57.9371
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased	304.5438
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him	622.8600
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	2302.1365
why what ails you asked he of edmond	325.4196
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest thank you and god reward you about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney	257.5997
danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side	1075.4690
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée	268.6377
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kittys in bringing it but at the first words she read she became livid	3301.6123
this son is named andrea cavalcanti	623.7541
the count advanced to meet him	5.4082
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention	1455.8125
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the hôtel de londres	97.2830
dartagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	151.9393
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	1241.4476
i am a priest and confessions die in my breast	5459.8828
at halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times you think so my lord answered la ramee	808.2068
for you and your comrades this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm	1852.6761
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary matter	428.4831
provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send valentine to you the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish	961.5142
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no i shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you i could not discover the others	125.9343
he sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over	166.2350
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank	309.1435
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime	3676.5293
he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest enough someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de winter	401.5905
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	303.9975
oh that is very goodindeed it is very good said louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envywill they go under a mans hat like the one i see down there you shall see said eugénie	435.3222

well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	1140.3871
what time is it then eh why it is after one oclock your home is a paradise porthos one takes no note of time	1774.4791
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources	2848.7637
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours	2867.3650
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to	393.3951

the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen	2405.6567

perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master	3539.0266
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later mazarin coughed a little	2490.6670
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly	984.9417
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak	264.5145
oh cried porthos as if in pain	3970.9185
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queens commands the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the kings bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen	672.7402
and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased	51.8660
he therefore found dartagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with him	46.6874
dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thinga grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury	4239.5195
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressingroom	239.6944

he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face	1128.7454
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves me come my friend come let me embrace you	454.2827
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another	424.4423
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tablethe rarest of all luxuries in their complete formare well understood the suppertable was loaded with waxlights and flowers	23117.5312
when i awoke a fresh meal was served	1206.5836
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniardstwenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet	3554.2539
i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it	476.0474

even on the night of the princes return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville	721.0689
noirtier and the elder dépinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife	1696.0537
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he hears	923.2019
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume	825.1622
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible	9504.2412
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the time if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queens service not at all said dartagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost you are right sir always right said anne of austria	242.5753

charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected	126.7170
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard	73.4922
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely	651.7527
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed	1135.7511

the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina	59.8011
theres one just arrived and she handed the letter to dartagnan	108.8311
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left dartagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything	126.6738
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king to the king but the king is asleep i have something important to reveal to him can it not be put off till tomorrow he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late come then said lord winter	132.6840

she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes	482.7133

and with whom with whom can it be if not the duke of the duke of yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice	671.9047
dartagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was	988.2089

give it to me said dartagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate	452.1139
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared	612.3054

at last dartagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and dartagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	2538.6348

what does this mean monsieur cardinal asked the king in a severe tone	135.2629
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head	176.6465
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twentyone years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master	1537.9326
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	106.0288

the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	414.0515
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose	267.2241

thou must add said dartagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servantman with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	567.8317

i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud	9447.0576
who calls me i said mazarin with his most smiling expression	1724.7246
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	516.1761

each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	5754.0684
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	539.9058

the office of the kings attorney chapter	702.9558
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	569.0997
it is true the cardinal had been particularly illtempered	3038.3552
several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	432.2840
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor davrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house	208.8784
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom	312.9308
albert she asked did you notice that what mother that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m	567.0721
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory	1324.3062
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell	1708.6429
de la trémouille to interrogate him himself	3111.0603
come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend	1578.8844
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	203.5478
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	528.1443
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong monte cristo opened the tortoiseshell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition	1112.9353
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled	1069.3143
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes who told you that i had been weeping said she	348.2196
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of laiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles _roberges_ and feluccas	4850.5708
good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him	972.7749
the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four freshlaid eggs	1395.9036
mousqueton collected a store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones	5548.2759
you have brought me something yes if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief here it is said aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it is	299.1347
the young man read valentines letter twenty times in the course of the day	479.9886
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken shall i send word to him as coming from you yes certainly shall i tell him that he can count on you to the end and you will leave the command to him of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinals hat in my own fashion you care about it then so much since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing	344.7310
have the fugitives been pursued yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted how many are there four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded four said dartagnan looking at porthos	681.1008
dartagnan a little recovered from his first surprise had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy	1788.4110
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the same	258.3231
ah its all one said the host i have lost two customers but this one remains of whom i am pretty certain for some days to come	286.3788
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in action and i said the marshal what am i to do wait here to receive the troops	121.4280
if you do not go sir said de guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be and then i swear your trial will be summary one can always find a tree and a cord the monks eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase i will goand he went	1321.1367
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events	726.6751
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim	19.8468
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind	365.7513
m i do not know he is no longer in my hands replied villefort	90.6236
i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if i do i shall learn nothing further at this very moment mazarin entered	331.9311
danglars it is i do not do so reverend sir why not because you would bring us to ruin and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes reverend sir said caderousse drawing still nearer	460.1720
let dartagnan speak said athos you know he always has wise advice to give clearly said dartagnan we must go where they will not look for us	359.8375
but said dartagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money	257.8429
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	2938.3118
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	220.3042
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge	349.8818
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite	669.9526
ali is the supper ready at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the diningroom	322.6147
well where is he sir asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	1610.8060
oh what is the matter cried dantès	95.3874
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queens orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much bonacieux fell into a profound reflection	273.4705
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under dartagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself	890.6743
we shall know sir replied the president	13.3018
my mother was a christian and she prayed	6544.6343
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal	385.6055
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	830.3866
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith	215.9954
at five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune	760.3407
there are your instructions said mazarin go go tis easy to say so but that requires money and i havent any ah replied mazarin so you have no money none my lord but the diamond i gave you yesterday i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence mazarin sighed	376.7105
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	153.6275
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a _calotte_ was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio	3445.4365
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention	7185.5444
mount my lord said dartagnan to mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding	271.8517
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window	238.0086
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them and i too said porthos good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling the queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away	199.6853
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air	94.0583
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said dartagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle	738.2045
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham	25.1763
dartagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for	13628.7598
absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between edmond and mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone m yes but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and ones name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that muttered fernand	801.0143
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franzs imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina	13205.0127
m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear herminei have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today	548.1819
diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel i confess i prefer the convent of noisy athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter	328.3969
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand	113.0577
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	243.5571
let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and deatha fatal secret known only when the storm bursts	6989.9463
what is that said he whence comes that cry from the wounded mans room replied the host	455.8435
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it indeed my dear friend said m	501.5991
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner how foolish you are have you forgotten that m	305.1524
are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd	1505.5178
and all thisall this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	269.0465
what have you done with her then if you have her no longer they have abducted her monsieur they have abducted her	193.6322
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so everything answered franzyour voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead ii live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	852.3411
it is not here he cried	127.5526
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity	19383.9180
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace	154.7471
might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete	174.8536
no i am lost do not be lost with me	50.1507
dartagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercers pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing	177.8507
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	575.9487
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i dont know my way	291.3660
are you going pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire and what message shall i convey to the baroness that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening the third act had begun and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars	265.6160
well said he on perceiving aramis	91.6180
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera	1256.2522
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step	76.2638
in one case or the other the trial was soon over	270.5044
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captains feet	32384.0645
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio	18375.2324
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	100.2241
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	2692.0208
why diamondsand she is covered with them to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame danglars	1751.5952
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman	466.4651
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winningpost in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy	1277.6560
it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	82.1156
let him follow me i will take him to his cell go said the gendarmes thrusting dantès forward	22018.8633
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thinga shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with earrings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies	18220.9707
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the icecold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hidingplace the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside	1151.4745
m dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	17721.6816
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks my dear fellow i mistrust women	363.8575
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria	677.5496
i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye	676.9385
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	3643.8884
m while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye	165.8132
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	357.7148
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening	190.4199
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment	245.3786
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take i have his letters said she	403.6108
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos	350.4303
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of m	283.1314
_ecco_ said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him	90.1991
grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road	371.4641
i cannot cry at my age they say that we have no more tearsstill i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping	167.1929
no you have notwell you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man	877.0848
what are your excellencys orders inquired gaetano	6952.2910
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_	1362.4789
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer	429.7081
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink	1053.6165
sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me unheard	757.0370
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companions words	163.6836
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as dartagnan says will carry the letter well said cried aramis you dont often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth	628.1788
speak i am ready to obey no monsieur no i am not called louis the just without reason	210.0107
how very singular cried monte cristo with wellfeigned astonishment	438.0623
how absurdas if one crown were not as good as another	256.9854
and what will he promise us said dartagnan	33.8727
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves this place if monsieur dherblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer	335.3784
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god the presence of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses	1261.8969
four young men of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world	1450.9296
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained	282.5105
if he lays his hand on the boats edge i will cut it off regicide that he is and i said porthos	465.6175
the nobles and ladies of their majesties suites were to dress two by two in chambers prepared for the purpose	1681.0303
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket	2208.3171
oh oh said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me	4435.0708
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order on our account said the three musketeers	159.8701
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m	120.4090
but he bethought him of m	182.1735
he was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late	620.2534
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	87.1322
and you really understand none of these signals none at all and have you never tried to understand them never	194.4203
the count does not know how should i know	40.9238
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task	1170.1877
are you sure of it certain replied grimaud	7016.5415
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed	134.2603
tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it	84.6834
himself captainhimself very well show him to me at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt	860.5520
anne of austria opened the door to him herself	116.0272
order of the king he said	71.0734
from la rochelle and you from england buckingham dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him	852.4492
are you hungry humiliating as such a confession is i am	1007.4261
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs	127731.5000
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said	289.8020
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina	162.8860
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen	651.2961
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglarsso be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned	530.0891
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself	3446.2942
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace	179.1811
he was very successful upon that question	136.9361
nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks	566.7915
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your boarders said milady oh my god poor woman i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	367.3233
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses	1635.2662
for what purpose upon my honor i will instantly return it to you	125.6169
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage	338.3863
well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all i think that matters look very gloomy madame but what step would you propose to me i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not you may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid once the chancellor reddened and stammered some words	393.0765
we shall go together shall we not said albert to the count	43.5175
the counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune	280.7521
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal	1603.1481
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as dartagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time	302.7035

however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor acockbill the jibboom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the _pharaon_ towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot	1014.2431
we are invited replied dartagnan to pass the night with m	66.0284
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came	1054.0718
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	2218.8682
ah i miss three they were here last night siri am sure they were herei counted them	5858.5884
your profession first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly	921.4805
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydées countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request oh it is nothing said monte cristo	647.5618
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the actthen one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh	5509.6001
but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude	125037.1641
dartagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him	981.5978
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications	891.0732
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had dartagnan in her power that she was present at his execution and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips	652.8433
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass	611.0328
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	225.4532
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him	52.8596
gentlemen cried chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to fight go then into charenton for i shall begin in a short timetheres a signal from the prince the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince	395.7677
you know or you dont know that that is what we ask of you oh yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises charles had heard and understood it all	1241.2085
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred	250.0152
this cannot be the establishment of athos	13.8519
yes a thousand times yes and who completed it as it now is i did	448.6586
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly	489.2401
what do you require then i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke she is found said milady	267.1675
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight of the order of st michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship	1196.1919
once outside the city dartagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood	414.2156
i have chosen a trade a trade	1839.8334
this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn	998.3959
ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for it the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing	632.0174
porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities	5310.2466
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened	3351.4629
the effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy	1158.6273
he therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke himself	431.3395
until then you will not see me	26.9845
he has followed us several times as i think when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness	280.2812
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation	845.0804
the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself	345.0237
we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars	1373.5016
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance	478.7412
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillons graces but the forearm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed	3941.7266
i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me	500.2495
lead me to him jacopo pointed towards the horizon	684.7225
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect who was your brother asked he	139.7309

i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her	2974.6819
tis not too warm to walk resumed dartagnan	14263.9375
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back	157.8681

the price of his blood she murmured	455.6175
her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his firstrate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife	2189.7395
morrel said châteaurenaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m	93.0880
when dartagnan had finished he said hum all this savors of his eminence a league off but what is to be done said dartagnan	477.3715
de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain and said villefort is it at your house in the champsélysées that you receive your visitors no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the country in the country yes where is it then	257.5799
never forget me oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their fathers neck	1011.0325
at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak and porthos perceived through the halfopen flap the little clerk who not being allowed to take part in the feast ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen	1484.4247
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	734.9963
he alone would have any influence with them i do not even know them under their true names you suspect me monsieur de rochefort i want him and you and all to aid me begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to ones destination you my dear monsieur de rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to vincennes where monsieur de beaufort is confined you will guard him well for me	193.7055
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible	307.5125
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	153.3502
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion	665.7966
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened	7557.9268
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	41.9072
that miladys son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already the devil he is said porthos	116.3646
thanksthanks but fortunately i do not want for anything and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me dantès made a gesture	426.1830
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine with a heavy heart dartagnan again bent his way toward the ferry	147.2282
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_ how dreadful said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	143.9595
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded	274.3409
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer	710.0347
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent	117.7280
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together _ma foi_ said maximilian in consternation	271.4955
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal	29.1830
de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies do you say m	1527.7867
albert ran to fetch a carriage	144.2856
danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your buttonhole yes they sent me the order of charles iii returned debray carelessly	515.2034
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	49.1258
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation	2158.6379
the wife of athos we have now to search for athos said dartagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue	168.0126
are you not rich yourself my fathers income is about francs per annum and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society	231.6308
davrigny returned about eight oclock in the morning he met villefort on his way to noirtiers room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept	72.1184

and follow me wherever i go to the worlds end then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god	302.8690
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	16.0849
that is impossible replied the governor	90.6676
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and dartagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation	309.5883
albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	1521.3422
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons	206.6040
they set out after a run of two leagues mousquetons horse sank	18908.4727
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself come come enough of such compliments cried porthos	1885.8470
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse but he will not wish for only one harness stake both _pardieu_ i am not selfish as you are you would do so said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself	2874.1177
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m	282.9951

i am condemned leave me to my death my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an executioner what do you mean asked the king	100.9742
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room	219.0879
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	129.6871
then sitting down by the fire my supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite well done carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while diavolaccio disappeared	1042.3654
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane	653.9948
emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered	7225.6274
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not	123.6177
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling	14230.2412
the two musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes	166.9898
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh	313.3973
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	395.3244
that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil and came to my estate bracieux	3340.5911

being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secretservice money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob	493.2939

no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked dartagnan	202.8411
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect	22675.2832
yes said he at length it is so	57.2984
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around	239.5796

for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side	1243.8943
at last he heard the voice of la ramee	33.0722
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others	25865.1602

i cannot hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever require stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	719.6966
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	499.7021
she went to the palais replied the steward	594.2635

still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity	767.5764
he then endeavored to reenter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman	2074.3586

it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	1796.5505

meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet	2412.7415
without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another way	471.5020
by jove i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the other	430.6997
i also was married at the deathbed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account still that idea of death madame said villefort	288.7774
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	227.3837
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance	175.3347
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault	825.7211
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again but how did the accident happen asked raoul	107.3865
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern	560.2408
they understood then from the few words which escaped from dartagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him dartagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way	281.5193
the light of day reassured me i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow	283.3647
yesterday for two hours i was at the church of saintphilippeduroule and for two hours i prayed most fervently	1046.9473
i shall work doctorwhen i work i forget everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work	293.6730
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for	292.5392
i do not think so added châteaurenaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly	178.3904
you appear to think much of your horse	85.8998
wasnt i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt	388.4809
who calls richelieu calls satan hold your tongue hold your tongue madame you may be overheard yes you are right i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness but what do you require of me then	326.5641
suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	19874.0684
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts	1618.8512
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	221.4895
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet	134.2478
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry out	708.1334
ah said dartagnan who began to understand	18.3290
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	224.1165
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of dartagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away	442.5547
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel	3419.3413
his two companions were already on horseback	301.1657
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence	83.4334
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter	206.6046
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter	112.5329
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved mea heart like yours felton a man like you	904.6512
he hastened to the sidedoor with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant	812.9346
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night	154.7834
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile	759.1467
the turnkey closed the door behind them	99.2436
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron	529.6555
then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history	69105.2422
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively	588.5311
i said a million replied danglars with the confidence of ignorance	736.4891
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with dartagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion	612.9410
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages	651.7444
the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected	189.8022
you understand dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience	240.0570
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries	16488.3164
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light	3139.1558
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion	3553.7285
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied dartagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i dont remember which wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose	425.5766
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you dartagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	304.9917
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	538.8225
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan	342.0491
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned	513.7844
you marry a moneybag label it is true well but what does that matter	128.9765
come said dartagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing dartagnan what is to be done	69.4642
ah monsieur de comminges he said	59.0574
and therefore said dartagnan to clip the hope which athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us noon the faith of a cardinal	573.8721
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up	1471.8624
at his announcement dartagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones	176.7344
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them	1388.0085
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar	184.6422
m an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel	198488.4844
look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable	2324.7817
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd	590.0336
egad yes but why dont you come there also athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here	280.3208
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	268.5199
de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	283.7962
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me	331.9268
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days	329.0180
dartagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts	2092.1438
dartagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men	382.0534
having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the faubourg sainthonoré the carriage drove on	1043.0471
scott of course the son of an illfated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy deaththe abbot ch	3078.7854
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it	471.6540
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god	3249.7529
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	658.8103
for the present he had no anxiety	7422.7007
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble	740.3682
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched	1746.7551

bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each others throat	232.3658
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested dartagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon	1799.2236

lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twentysecond	226.1261
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay	265.3966
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad	184.8052
dartagnan thought of all these matters	2050.1370
to my grandfathers room i in m	2399.8550
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant and what do you think of her personal appearance oh i consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what medora must have been franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company	339.8656

it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the carnival	73.3085
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of dartagnan	32.7661
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him	450.6466

in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon good said comminges	1110.4851
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	4988.3057
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the rd of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and peppino called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa and the men of his band hum the first will be _mazzolato_ the second _decapitato_ yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony really said franz	1087.9601

then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	556.7110
at the same hour as on the preceding evening dartagnan retired	175.7803
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned dartagnan	58.2432
the count followed her with his eyes	21.5873

at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner	1169.7827
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs	219.5606

this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	348.8962
