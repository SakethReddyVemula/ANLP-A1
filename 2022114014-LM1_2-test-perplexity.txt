by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	393.3096

he listened to know whence this sound could proceed	991.3630

the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos	109.0889
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	121.3599
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her	266.8394
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded	229.7460
de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	14386.1240

now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or alicante alicante if you please it is my favorite wine i have some that is very good	2353.3218

your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides	738.7573
alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips	626.4648
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely	4102.5171
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	103.8569
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle	491.7518
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini	316.5110

we have parted company this long time all three have left the service where can you find them then wherever they are thats my business well now what are your conditions if i employ you money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require	191.2236
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them	881.4540
and madame de saintméran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirthree drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m	649.3561
valentine with her womans instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	260.8244
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st leu being not far from that locality	192.1602
julie threw herself into his arms	38.3028
lover and husband ah madame said dartagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband you have then overheard our conversation asked mme	78.5420

teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits	142.0898
i answered mazarin i shall not sleep at all i have work to do gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose	240.6051
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely	133.1751
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	250.2921
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools	414.0170
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so	123.6269
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	152.4122
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from dartagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment	154.8223
at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadles robe and spend all your time reading your breviary	371.1454
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo	421.5009
we have met him twice at general cromwells	24241.1309
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme	559.8862
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance	5521.2822
ah why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought dartagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned a perfect stillness in the house	527.6263
well i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future soninlaw how would you set about it ah that would be easy enoughi would give her a lesson a lesson yes	320.7377
now we are alone dear aramis said dartagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchets horse ifaith answered aramis as you see from heaven from heaven replied dartagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which dartagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same here then is a puzzle for the learned observed dartagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near	251.8931
how absurdas if one crown were not as good as another	127.8392
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states	108.2417
but how comes the diamond in your possession sir	178.8481
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them	143.6676
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six oclock in the morning	33.6949
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovelywhat a complexion and such magnificent hair is she french no a venetian and her name is countess g ah i know her by name exclaimed albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty	289.6334
you see we had each our mission said porthos mine was to guard you and i am doing so	163.0530
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter after all the disclosures which were made this morning m	375.6295
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care	463.1849
but proceed i beg of you	3.7230
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the kings closet opened and m	82.1858
well exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison	2256.2219
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious	433.4518
you see said dantès quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage	110.6184
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter	286.3303
dartagnan said the minister sitting down i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer i hope said dartagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend therefore i apply to you	96.2050
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais	145.1289
bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanrue de la fontaine no no was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage	233.8982
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts	279.9033
they expected to hear some mention made of dartagnan or of porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms	1312.3553
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly	186.4258
kitty said he i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like dont let that disturb you and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry	188.4133
then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain	174.9283
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a _priedieu_ all its furniture	3262.6152
my cloakstop up the aperture with it why asked blaisois	231.8333
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantèsthe latter of whom attracted universal notice	1341.0173
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have said to you to this man or i am lost and it would be youyou then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to feltons mouth	242.3898
besides the end justified the means as you frenchmen say does it not yes my lord i accept them said dartagnan and if it please god we will make a good use of your presents well now your hand young man	158.9201
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	1203.9749
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name	1462.1287
cocles went first and the stranger followed him	88.8917
have you that means it is to be found for the searching	66.3101
no part of the programme differedthe names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information	1088.1390
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying	654.5789
de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation albert turned	471.5962
oliva corsinari was it not oliva corsinari a marchioness a marchioness and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family yes that was the way it ended and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said monte cristo	551.2946
he has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen	156.1317
in fact the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman and he awaited with impatience the moment always in the future when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock	310.2298
father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	92.5323
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	1035.4385
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine	221.6062
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man	52.3407
her lips were cold it appeared to dartagnan that he had embraced a statue	82.1488
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of châteaurenaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence	410.6136
madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers julie still lay with her head on his shoulder emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrels family and the sailors at the door	120.3055
the prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed	191.7811

let things take their course perhaps you may not have to retract bah said albert staring	981.6848
dartagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as dartagnan	528.1013
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe selfexamination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement	1227.6094
what are these things replied anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful	12021.7422
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	170.6993
dartagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st germain	64.1106
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear dukeyou may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving	293.9213

on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	209.0206
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	148.0730
i demand the suppression of the thesis since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably	578.6006
signed abbé busoni it is the same what do you mean said the major	29.4715
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	83.2637
but tell me well what do you wish to know will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight seventeen replied albert	122.7670
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur darminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two grooms	174.8804
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace	92.9767
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise	36.1360
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	439.6202
dantès had entered the château dif with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past	484.6208
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water	429.5239
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	249.7278
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur dherblay entirely as to the last point though i agree with him on the first	420.3762

here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you said the sentinel	107.8315
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of dartagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away no replied dartagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour	342.1605
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared	892.9945
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle	2986.7461
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them	191.4717
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square	149.4516
it is well sir replied villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side	232.9135
never mindin the meantime he marries mercédèsthe lovely mercédèsat least he returns to do that during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousses words fell like molten lead	3353.9312
he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again	189.7254
noirtier said davrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade	212.0347
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthoss nor aramiss and as to athos he had none	218.7987
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	1902.1765
it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young	124.4458
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	120.2601
i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared	126.5614
de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again de wardes one of the cardinals men a cousin of rochefort stop my friend i have an idea speak monsieur in your place i would do one thing what while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions	242.8983
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them	659.6977
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	297.6803
the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light	1779.7321
is the count shooting in the gallery said morcerf	120.4303
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles	1339.9064
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference	492.3947
she was a perfect linguist a firstrate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellowa young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer	3113.1824
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father	170.8313
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	74.7318
but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort	290.4197
at length the hour drew near	226.8188
my dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word i will blow out your brains but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon so much the better they must be good animals then sir i shall call my people and i mine ive ten guards behind me dont you hear them gallop	158.2188
noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	548.1365
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	176.2300
de villefort entered his fathers room followed by madame de villefort	37.5631
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing	295.2836
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for fishing	2451.7429
of what must i repent stammered danglars	1857.7397
go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the gardenhedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence	422.4399
albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position	1809.0299
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned youis that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	169.1915
dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	390.5934
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	119.1639
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale	98.5982
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	253.8968
you may madame said he with emphasis	110460.9375
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked violently	5769.6792

but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up	633.1066
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence	4515.6016
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham the duke of buckingham assassinated cried all present with one voice	186.1151
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m	624.2328
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile	612.1973
i want to know what crime i have committedto be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector	338.3936
he found athos and aramis philosophizing	379151552.0000
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you	90.8518
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton turn to the left so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the window they are coming then said porthos	138.7881
dartagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist	667.4578
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please it was three oclock in the afternoon	72.0503
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free willthe satisfaction to you will be the same	180.5292
the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword but the name of m	130.8283
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope	45.5984
redistribution is subject to the trademark license especially commercial redistribution	6510.3589
dartagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him	97.9786
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy	80.6896
it was now athoss turn to take a sly look	286.5494
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant	570.3146
bonacieux in a tone of reproach ah monsieur i had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman	142.3330

in whose name do you come said he to him	40.0355
pardon me i love him so much these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace	146.5844
_morbleu_ monsieur said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you perhaps said athos	121.7721
while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriagecontract were being carried on at the house of m	152.4503

m a girl of six or seventhat is a little younger than vampatended sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa	3404.0264
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarins arrest wouldnt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage say at once you disapprove of my proposal i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	411.5690
ah la ramee if you would but accept my offers i would make your fortune how	174.3881

lean a little to the left	891.2725
is there any difficulty in the way no replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn the deuce that puts a different face on the matter	504.6016
they carried valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack	728.0469
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers thats true said dantès but the corridor you speak of only bounds _one_ side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	676.1514
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent	22.1414
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared	28028.9062
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been dartagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man	49.4717
yes count returned julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels the counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth	249.6463

it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name	819.5157
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	239.2913
i my lord said dartagnan why should i because you shrug your shoulders it is a way i have of speaking to myself	237.0321
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean	319.0312
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still	282.6903
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	126.0953
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles inot the same thing by any means	283.5866
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said dartagnan	193.0104
de tréville was informed by dartagnan and porthos of the circumstance	76.1720
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	90.5066
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her motherinlaw as you please sir said franz	211.1203
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m	479.1774
elssler was dancing in _le diable boiteux_ the greek princess was in ecstasies	23911.2363
the house to which dartagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening	165.2075
really my lord you are his nightmare the duke smiled with bitterness	1242.9148
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglarsa small octagonalshaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin	3436.7368
now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten	1971.8080
the people who wrote are anglogermans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	408.3026
the baroness took advantage of her husbands absence to push open the door of her daughters study and m	243.3183
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him	8.1318

i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that dartagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage	226.2705
at six oclock villefort retired to his study at eight m	132.3316
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul	144.5869
i was mistaken said the host hes not quite dumb	1269.1345
i have distrusted god i could the more easily distrust you	861.5391
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne	474.9848

the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe	1481.8893
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments	616.9906
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me m the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dantès	440.5938

the horses will have a long nights rest and at five oclock tomorrow morning we can be again on the road olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling	740.7069
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as ours	738.2094
mordaunt went away with the captain	1001.9556
no from you yes you thoroughly understand me sir	1483.1489

it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten days	153.6133
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	2389.9700
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister	100.3918
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into lifevalentine the daughter by my first wifemademoiselle renée de saintméranand edward the boy whose life you have this day saved and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo	1119.1409

the road as dartagnan had observed was the way to blois	191.3806
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order	118.3552

well cried his auditors at the moment you left his house aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat	219.4251
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant	376.1910
how they must be asking where is the cardinal what has become of the minister where has the favorite gone how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners what comments must be made and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph it is frightful murmured mazarin	395.6365
all his funds amounted to or francs his bills receivable up to the th to or which making the best of everything gave him francs to meet debts amounting to francs	1608.5104
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you i do not enter the church i reenter it	327.1690
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched	172.7539
for pitys sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressingfor pitys sake do not call assistance save mei will not harm you andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies	1542.6656
the walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the sea	8149.3501
well _pardieu_ said aramis it was only this i had a dream and i related it to her yez yez said the swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but i neffer dream you are very fortunate said athos rising i wish i could say as much neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything	743.0335
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st marks column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château dif the work i speak of is called _a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy_ and will make one large quarto volume and on what have you written all this on two of my shirts	306.9297
the steps were already down and the door open	82.3357
it was indeed for him that they were there	40.5287

let us try what we can do then said the notary	50.1135
alas he said i am then to die	96.4922
you see he said to porthos	446.2804
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	2089.1133
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerfs apartments	266.5440
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head	381.8580
one hours rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young mans bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedoma pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependenceseemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future	1542.2236
come my dear bazin tell me where he is didnt you hear me tell you monsieur dartagnan that i dont know where he is yes certainly but to that i answer that it is impossible it is nevertheless the truth monsieurthe pure truth the truth of the good god dartagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided	200.0624
never fear quarrels but seek adventures	49895.7852
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part	142.9105
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done mordaunt bowed humbly	184.4558
ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans indifference	864.4773
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time let us see what this letter contains we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england	752.1783
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts	611.2948
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in she passed first	127.7742
a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead	578.5186
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest	168.0234
even on the night of the princes return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville	436.9614
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weaponswhich were very beautifulif not with envy at least with curiosity	185.9679
they set out after a run of two leagues mousquetons horse sank	7769.0107
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	1249.8171
has he not already forgotten she ever existed	1259.2786
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him	182.0180
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced	218.7386
no god forbid said the cardinal only at what hour was he with you oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later at what hour did he leave your hôtel at half past tenan hour after the event well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos _was_ taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessarts company yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected that house is suspected tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it indeed sire i did not	258.9313
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	159.5837
thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment	324.9497
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand	534.9800
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune	340.9133
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	155.4342
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a _carte blanche_ by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is dartagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean	427.9326
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	314.2250
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel is it a very beautiful vessel i would not wish for a better to sail round the world of what burden is she about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather	287.1669
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance	427.3673
toward midday lord de winter entered	373.6072
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his mother	910.9825
morrel i hearyou insinuating dog you m	224.1684
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed dartagnan to porthos and went on his way	77.6260
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet we went out	275.2997
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer	70.1381
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent in his convent what convent	418.1202
an enemy in my house do you say edmond if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more fernands eye darted lightning	275.7886
but i as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout my lord said athos we are just arrived from england and our first concern is to inquire after your health thanks gentlemen thanks as you see my health is but indifferent	783.7818
then he took the boy upon his knee	93.5494
the religion i serve the god i adore were blasphemed because i called upon that religion and that god but still i resisted	1033.9607
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray	8281.1025
you understandno more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	112.4303
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for dartagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin	458.2226
you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own	68.3252
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	2337.3308
mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock and i caught it mamma dont you remember interposed edward and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail you madame remained under the arbor do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as i told you mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle he was a medical man i think precisely so madame this man was myself for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician	368.5602
well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself stay said the young man	219.9543
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin thats all very well replied dartagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh	225.7186
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	1044.5562
faria bent on him his penetrating eye	742.4481
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening	211.1709
refer to your papers you are not busoniyou are not monte cristo	417.8089
what are you doing here asked the count seeing him covered with dust i did not send for you i think baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter	89.2783
it was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern	232.9296
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	102.3142
from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier	277.0667
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealththat first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man	1392.4991
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard	79.3298
lord de winter on quitting dartagnan gave him his sisters address	771.3483
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	226.4440
i am a priest resumed aramis	73.8179
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved	175.7358
is it my fortune which you find insufficient	4386.9551
but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief	660.6906
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives	1753.2205
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly tomorrow comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset	245.9274
there were two doors he bolted them both	24179.3008
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir	769.7401
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion	144.7840
his praises increased raouls friendship twofold	9414577.0000
goodby oh by the way youd better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote	20299.8223
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden	33.4900
which was the real delinquent both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post and where was this letter written at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast twas so thentwas so then murmured the abbé	274.1540
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for the voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the partition	996.9097
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried dartagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english spain is her country replied dartagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself	198.4857
i have since learned that he was confined in the château dif and i should like to learn some particulars of his death what was his name the abbé faria oh i recollect him perfectly cried m	101.2931
pray observe that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title	271.2135
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	147.6507
do you think emmanuel would oblige me i will answer for him count well	76.2320
go monsieur duke and return often	1437159.0000
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves	559.7820
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt	261.6687
ah dear dartagnan see how regularly i live and how easy i am here	291.7902
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself	142.3384
is it mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent oh you hear that flamarens said chatillon	481.0107
how long a start have they two hours and a quarter my officer two hours and a quarterthat is nothing we are well mounted are we not porthos porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses	339.5787
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance you have truly monsieur said dartagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you please	193.0119
order i am ready for everything for everything cried dartagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus	131.9868
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched francs then these francs said mercédès shuddering	312.6258
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued dartagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly	263.8898
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten well madame in that case my advicei know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majestymy advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom	278.2231
he had seen in his provincethat land in which heads become so easily heateda few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony	1272.3551
i may sleep perhaps at an inn pierre obeyed	7839.9565
patience said athos i had a plan	208.4869
and why asked the old man	3.4475
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome	519.9473
i mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it my friend said gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attaini mean the remission of my sins the war will not only be approved of but directed by the church	286.8797
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking over public affairs	213.5824
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace	180.7602
meanwhile villefort and davrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	744.2310
four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room	99.7200
come sweep away all that for me shoulder muskets present arms aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that dartagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter	4488.9976
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him	33.4223
dartagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	613.8978
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy	7559.6567
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons	2158.5608
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king	106.0759
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off come added the king	163.4957
come gentlemen your swords said the duke	17.2841
he vaulted hastily from his horse whilst planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house	73.1551
our bestborn and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it	321.2894
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert and the steamboat she is at châlons yes the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels very good when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road your excellency may depend upon me the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers house	460.9541
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung and on what account i rescued from the hands of mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years will you name him oh you know him well my lordit is count de rochefort ah really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned	178.4204
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects	198.0555
to do with you my lord inquired aramis	54.2630
i am planchetplanchet whom you know well but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview	154.0394
should he find him at all	61.9045
you have my promise he said after a minutes pause extending his hand to monte cristo	92.2908
but not before one oclock replied dartagnan	58.0783
you never knew her eh madame who knows said athos	153.0341
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude	999.3504
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	269.0337
be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen herself what do you say sire	161.9748
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurators wife	292.7720
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count	87.7240
planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of dartagnan and which dartagnan from that time made shift to do without	421.8553
goodbye said châteaurenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right	236.7186
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel	182.4512
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground	876.2713
mordaunt mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed dartagnan	226.6963
but hark i think some one is coming mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example	161.7144
but what is the matter albert	1797.2377
yes but it is not a horse for hard work you are mistaken i rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the place st sulpice ah you begin to awaken my regret regret yes i have parted with him how why here is the simple fact	245.3257
everything dartagnan even folly has its limit then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own i presume	2710.2783
how did the honor or disgrace of m	323.2134
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful	232.9207
the three musketeers possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about dartagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from dartagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent	148.7335
a florentine adventurer sire and that was all while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of francethat is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world she is not the less guilty monsieur duke the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her fall	212.4818
dartagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queens apartment	367.3189
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	210.6747
upon hearing dartagnans reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him	233.1965
go to your chamber said she to mme	243.3277
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	174.3873
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness happy father happy son said the count	416.1774
yes shall i give these papers to m	119.0502
ali is the supper ready at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the diningroom	285.6386
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno	893.9058
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	238.4384
at length i heard the wellknown noise of the door which opened and shut i heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed haste haste said felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead then continued milady then i collected all my strength i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck	365.6762
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	120.2649
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m	105.8618
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	4184.2378
well what is the matter asked the young lieutenant	138.3976
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass	144.1599
the young counts conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	556.8846
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia	832.4716
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded francs	10485.0693
this was julie who had become as the clerk of the house of thomson french had predicted madame emmanuel herbault	410.1668
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base	994.3323
ah said he involuntarily following noirtiers eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed	120.4481
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in ritas bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest	410.4906
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit	406.2121
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly the conduct is infamously violent do you know that monsieur the king commands it madame excuse me i will not suffer it no no i would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise	307.5499
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared	147.4841

athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy	385.8984

but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness	671.6340
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	124.0973
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	89.4185

as he alighted he thought he saw his fathers pale face behind the curtain of the counts bedroom	107.4353
no louise no this evenings adventure will serve for my excuse	616.9974
to join the army under the prince count and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	79.8925

one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges	245.4921
we lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life	826.2391
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me i thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away i do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion sire interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle to any one laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except mancini now mancini was a nephew of mazarins and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister	290.0828
charles was impatiently awaiting his return	771.3321

it was that of a number of men steadily approaching	1797.4854
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasinesscorsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	482.1784
about this time the nurses cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand	82.3429
the count of sanfelice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigis arm in a group of peasants	1115.2882

stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for me having thus spoken dartagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	329.8326
another might threaten to seek m	475.7516
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai dorléans	274.8628
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight	499.9829
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ships lantern was hung up at the masthead instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore	917.3393
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	217.9435

he is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	2080.1392
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl	40.6379
bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband	98.4266
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing	108.0006
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office	145.3980
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rocheforts servant	154.7760
he was hungry he supped he went to bed	68.5582
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep yes sire said aramis yes you are right	81.3645
this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach	4111.0903

but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold	144.5043
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	103.2395
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand	418.0578
let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left hand exactly so cried aramis	221.6253
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies	934.7798
i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket yes madame i have that of the garter which king charles i	176.2212
when you leave this you will behold my men at work	356.0970
see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld	972.7503
besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward paris	224.9133
you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely	148.3118
a vision at four oclock the four friends were all assembled with athos	147.6374
for stealing for stealing you rochefort you are laughing at me i understand	136.4745
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos	257.5455

i neither approve nor disapprove my lord i merely await your commands good it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain liar thought dartagnan	456.0644
milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like chaos	8933.5361
now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate spot in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace it was because you loved me was it not count	155.5061
in the kings name cried comminges	530.7495
but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass	138.3067
de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel	91.0767
de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m	8303.0469
but this confession concerns me only	639.0007
here after a short conference they proposed to separate	397.2276
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	173.6615
i believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this no of the french academy but what has the french academy to do with all this i was going to tell you	850.9393
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	252.8036
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle	537.5707
i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known good my son	147.7431
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing dartagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger	242.5284
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty	287.8867
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison in prison said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges	538.1301
yes my lord ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling	76.3313
he he murmured she can it be he and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed	89.4565
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber	439.5865
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm	278.3311
you will find in the same way four relays on your route	2813.7561
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed	371.6222
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	2705.9795
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it but dartagnan was still in a desponding mood	133.1986
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for anything	120.3519
but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray	215.3074
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated	1287.2329
besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair	155.7012
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to athos aramis and winter said now gentlemen i am at your service but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp	209.2140
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write	97.1451
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of dartagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away	269.6741
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton ah sir my left side still pains me are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant egad didnt you hear	1118.4585
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan	189.8535
still though not actually received at the hôtel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess	812.5335
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety	1201.8927
de tréville looking at the clock why thats impossible look rather monsieur said dartagnan the clock shows it thats true said m	492.7426
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel dartagnan began to recover himself little by little	320.6479
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary	130.8705
still you must breakfast somewhere but if i am not hungry said the young man	26.5383
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties	544513.6250
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentines death	105.9170
i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel	1703.6656
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	722.5392

porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of dartagnan and his yellow horse	212.7325
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding	296.0743

then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure	383.5908
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	173.0175
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client	258.0023

i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercédès by the life of my father speak monsieur said villefort	105.4125
you have done well to warn me	74.7098
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy dartagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him	352.3609
dartagnan went to the window with his habitual composure	489.1359
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders	91.7364
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	2104.8782
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors	385.0334
i shall get them all in time oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jestas for that you wont get them at all	529.1042
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies cannot hear us but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets yes said athos thats grimauds business well then cried dartagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls heaven forfend said athos they may serve us these bodies serve us said porthos	334.9554
m while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye	124.2184
from whom is this said he eagerly	92.8108
and you have succeeded exclaimed davrigny	514.0429
lucien debray private secretary to the minister of the interior m	56.0711
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you dartagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man oh thats very well young man continued m	256.0134
are you satisfied now inquired valentine	125.4243
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse	1378.3021
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès	677.4975
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i dont know my way	169.7031
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel	318.1250
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	645.4125
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you	445.2733
it was only known that on the following sunday a te deum would be sung at notre dame in honor of the victory of lens	482.0209
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon	439.1331
the discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously	603.8487
bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day	179.5718
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money no to the cardinal its the same thing cried the young woman	162.1261
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone	330.1831
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed	239.4720
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti	569.6927
from the time dartagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twentyfive or twentysix years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times dartagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	1251.4720
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another	329.0091
and you shall be alone replied the young man	13.6700
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge	275.3186
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	192.4915
do you know the decision we have come to mother have we come to any yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercédès sighed	163.0970
the boat is waiting for us come besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time	644.6817
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said dartagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force	605.8901
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning	313.1064
you have seen my dear alberti ask the question as a motheryou have seen m	2486.1035
nothing could turn him from his purpose	82.5964
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur	97.0487
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventyfive thousand livres per annum	526.1297
we dispense with your saying grace grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive	904.3411
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange	743.3702
i swear by dont waste time in swearing said dartagnan let us gallop if our horses will consent and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies	2794.0659
one thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders	124.8330
villefort ran upstairs without saying a word	79.6887
but what happened after my departure how can i tell said kitty	171.7937
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued	1092.2130
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert	141.3679
sell cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left	1340.3180
oh no exclaimed edmond that will not be	29.2712
davrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son villefort suffocating pressed the doctors arm	600.1686
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon	2438.6016
and where will your worship drink there answered the traveler pointing to the table	254.6442
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	24572.6035
i shall be obliged to give up hunting as i have given up hawking	3243.6501
de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv	212.9438
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons	2678.5212
davrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m	103.4787
de trévilles spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m	840.6382
as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could	296.1039
fernands mind was made up he would shoot dantès and then kill himself	835.8752
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty no no blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and _pardieu_ you know his fathers name his father yes noirtier noirtier the girondinnoirtier the senator he himself and your majesty has employed the son of such a man blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	508.8062
he rushed toward dartagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms	73.1199
in the meanwhile the promises of m	39.7500
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculationodious as all his calculations were	263.8235
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago ah _mon dieu_ exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for francs well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills then said monte cristo here are francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m	283.6954
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the th thermidor and the th of april in the year were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites	825.5333
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwells tent dartagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle	204.1700
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them	77.6849
a child encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river impossible cried madame danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child perhaps continued villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital oh yes yes cried the baroness my child is there i ran to the hospital and learned that the same nightthe night of the th of septembera child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half	482.4098
this cavalier is my attendant would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host	202.9508
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demigod has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man	207.9940
whilst this scene was going on dartagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze	351.2725
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped	62.7775
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz	309.3069
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair	1527.5114
it was only on the following day at about ten oclock in the morning as he was starting to call on m	52.9110
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort	397.9589
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder	588.7360
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire	6298.4165
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief	425.1514
i would take the hundred pistoles	26.0857
oh death is in my house cried villefort	112.0615
now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable to no one by heaven i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place	518.7598
now promise me to remember this and expect me the st of may at the same hour in the forenoon capital exclaimed albert your breakfast shall be waiting where do you live no rue du helder have you bachelors apartments there	566.1141
lord winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	391.2794
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all dartagnan wished	531.6733
grief has consumed her said villefortyes grief doctor after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	431.7132
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman	197.6995
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king	524.7026
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well theres nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos	82.9734
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and fainted	149.7132
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity	103.0965
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival	126.5138
as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments	10142.2812
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m	175.2418
will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied up charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman	526.1646
parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway declined	1790.4324
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend	1518.2795
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	211.2453
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut i will believe all you say so proceed but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience	277.2472
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line	275.3707
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	141.6002

now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him	343.2664
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame	186.2963

de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the diningroom	257.3438
see what an exordium cried the jesuit	61.5016
you would have done what i did mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength	236.6915
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat	286.8135
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him	140.3502
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	254.5555
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to dartagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	691.5544
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerfs are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness	75.6280
milady seemed overcome with joy and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with de wardes when he received the letter how he had responded what was the expression of his face if he seemed very amorous	323.0708
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet then he carried haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will	335.9280

do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied dartagnan	126.0681
one of the notaries sat down the other remained standing	92.1517
look and dartagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	558.7511
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward	148.4915
now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn	622.0966
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him	108.1034
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance	1828.9818
then the postscript well what of the postscript then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter certainly the abbé busoni and myself have a small account open between us	447.8306
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war	182.9717
dartagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	142.3405
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy	262.2049
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel	242.1666
he proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles	500.0694
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man	1071.6686

athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be taken	173.6246
i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars	6863.4683
the sergeant drew near to planchet	2095.6753
after dinner the count of monte cristo was announced	27.0038
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and i were drinking and what did you do said dartagnan	100.7510
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said dartagnan people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal well but my poor bazin reflect a little	466.5451
she ran to the window and opened it	31.9134
there are only a dozen men at the most that would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two	102.8443
italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head	45.0028
what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead she suited me in every respect and i would have married her and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars departure before he left the house	209.3567
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with travellers	203.7986
de villefort kings attorney yes and if you wish to know his name i will tell ithe is named villefort the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience	285.0689
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m	119.2218
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation they are hot royalists said groslow	593.2845
the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons	681.5374
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like eugénie sufficiently	230.8569
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it	138.7526
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion	326.3728
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure oh my legs my poor legs where are you murmured coquenard and he tried to smile	178.5797
de villeforti intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house	533.2113
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	134.9996
take your glass then and let us drink	64.0572
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for	195.6630
and what is your choice asked jussac	2750.0029
i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	320.5302
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face	131.8752
now my wife came home four days ago monsieur	230.6375
let them hold themselves in readiness to march tonight	527.2186
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès	1957.2115
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded	95.0110
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young mans countenance for an instant	72.6670
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day	309.3550

im your man i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner	100.5814

as ten oclock was striking dartagnan left m	380.8857
he is here who miladys son athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence does grimaud know him then no but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him the headsman of bethune exclaimed de winter	220.7554
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief	471.1130
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me	506.3846
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs deau cest bien prouvé par le déluge you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand	890.5138
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband	170.6056
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous	336.7126
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m	180.4540
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty	314.0800
true he replied and my protector is very kind that dear protector said caderousse and how much does he give you monthly five thousand francs as many thousands as you give me hundreds truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate	398.7323
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee	157.1368
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the english regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance	174.1075
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred	253.6728
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any illfeeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesyour father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them	521.8257
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers	1269.8235
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein	1066.0138
this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and well interrupted dartagnan i am delighted that de rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the kings servants they will hang thee without mercy	364.7120
the result of these reflections was that dartagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possiblea desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight	353.5957
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain	281.5143
and now said dartagnan to the governors but you are wounded it seems said planchet	149.7562
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man	153.4617
ja replied the gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue	215.2974
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated	1981.5483
the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband we are very happy monsieur replied julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves the counts features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity	334.1993
oh fear nothing madame said the young woman clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queens sorrows i am your majestys body and soul and however far i may be from you however inferior may be my position i believe i have discovered a means of extricating your majesty from your trouble you oh heaven you cried the queen but look me in the face	175.2386
dartagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right	62.6901
have you seen my mother asked albert	105.8676
may i ask what you were doing there my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in london were you pleased with paris sir yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our ownnot against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an italian the queens favorite ah i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell that is to say i am in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms	225.0277
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are	40.6544
bazin hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	429.3003
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited dartagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place	228.6984
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands	225.0207
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind	193.6838

i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	1028.8258
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of men i admire greatly still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person	903.2094
an hour after her table was cleared but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the soldiers	189.4900
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction	146.1245
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to you the count smiled bitterly	99.1531
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed goodevening maximilian you are punctual thank you ah is it you count said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristos hand with both his own	330.1181
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity	73.6780
he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose	146.4061
who says this aramis is not a wit	2608.8503
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored liquid	292.8129
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron	82.0050
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer	141.6275
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	382.7049
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops	581.2386
it is thisi swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the th of february between nine and ten oclock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did	386.1227
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed true said la ramee	494.4987
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	701.4557
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance	446.5362
but will that not excite suspicion sir asked the queen	133.7397
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	616.9018
you have decidedly some genius at your control _ma foi_ spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvetlined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf	198.9911
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was dartagnans mount	15433.3076
and we say proud as a gascon replied dartagnan	81.8466
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him	124.0826
we are for the king and the princes added athos	89.5877
at last i mastered my agitation	24074.2871
give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge	179.7120
this belonged to one of his friends at the café de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of mauléon rue saintdominique that being the name and address on the card	379.9701
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other	187.5377

dartagnan looked and was seized with pleasure	138.2941
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing	739.7736
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier	685321024.0000
the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him	143.5197
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road the devil he does money and a large sum said mazarin	171.2872
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	464.6061
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel cried dartagnan you were all in the plot then and i really dont know what prevents me from exterminating you all alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see	1104.7953
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	228.8519
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere yes sire replied athos	41.3714
let us take our precautions athos but suppose they come unarmed	3309.3955
faith ive half a mind to do it	63.0688
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugénie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing	194.4019
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat	377.8652
he is not dead then no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood	238.4148

say to her peace or war my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	250.9875
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villeforts room who had said she would receive them there	104.9238
ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abbé smiled	1923.6630
dartagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence	72.8013
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was mme	151.2043
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house the other the physician	233.1136
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered	1050.2909
he shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream	430.8799
my dear dartagnan said aramis dont be too angry with me i beg	76.4904
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen	295.9568

ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she	263.4828
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man	9.7604
jealousy fury offended pride all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love urged her to make a revelation but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that dartagnan would also be lost to her forever	457.7681
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility	902.0989

in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn child	2151.6121
the three windows were still untenanted	65092732.0000

on that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation	852.5154
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes	125.4194
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him	206.8291
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain	465.2790
a few dingy olives and stunted figtrees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict	123113.1953
i supplicate you i implore you on my kneeslet me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself	1603.3461

the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and granddaughter of henry iv the wife and daughter of charles i	394.4310
he repliedhe replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	235.8865
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	165.8263

all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language	18307.1543
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the kings attorney but can you not say that sir	190.9967
ah this time cried dartagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment	74.5163
he took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids	118.4009
why buy what one can take take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor	2517.7610
well you said porthos what then i cannot wait oh as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	235.7910
he then rose and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness	64.0357
they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered	25.8783
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham	304.7119

listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important	287.0013
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy	92.5034
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her	168.0013
i shall find many men as able as you are i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	109.7135
a prisoner repeated porthos quite dejected	14984.6611
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporteah is that you de winter	1103.1628
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its transparency	514.5834
a few seconds afterward dartagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which illconcealed the sheath of a long sword	304.5393
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met	121.4694
come athos and aramis go to the right porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach paris he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route	675.7060
i dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	2021.5551
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume	111.9611
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself	524.1978
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what	117.0587
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were	68.3048
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted	9228.8418
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations	12414.6904
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers chapter	315.7093
only one minute mr felton and you will have saved my honor to kill yourself cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground i have told my secret he knows all my god i am lost felton remained standing motionless and undecided	179.1438
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me no not if thou dost not oppose my flight but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place you are determined to leave the chateau by heaven and earth this night i am determined to be free and if i defend myself or call or cry out i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman at this moment the clock struck	129.2746
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat	109.5362

adieu adieu dearest edmond cried mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the balcony	257.4050
yes sir by whom inquired cromwell	426.0919
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not	59.7202
dartagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error	47.2947
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands	167.1078
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss	1256.6482
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	313.2442
no and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youhe should have occupied my placehe should have emptied that glasshe should have risen against the assassin	725.9575
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	254.5369
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i dont know who for my part and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in a tremulous voice	167.7675

caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn	238.9552
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke danjou his brother	223.8491
life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach well sir said danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled	381.1120
at eight oclock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition	246.1811
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation	234.3738
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness	990.0298
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy	270.1783
this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside	615.8675
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances	1571.8915
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port	62.6798
row said he to the sailors	1426.2556
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom	241.5245
there are many stories related of him and among them this	120.0935
oh oh replied dartagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen	226.9585
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life	86.8683
dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	68.4596
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everythingyou are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni	276.7561
danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught sterlets said châteaurenaud are only found in the volga and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro impossible cried all the guests simultaneously	5445.9307

bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition	2052.0491
at madame de villeforts proposition he instantly winked his eyes	848.4629
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk	397.0314
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	408.0352
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m	446.7268
then dartagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting	114.8948
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	1232.8531
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales	988.8004
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss	238.7416
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country porthos opened his mouth to reply	150.7591
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château dif for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged	449.5533
do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud	18749.5918

i think these fellows will never come if you are in haste monsieur said dartagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to dartagnan	115.5983
has not some sage said nothing too much	224.7371
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer	629.5035
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his sons warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the distance	1194.1112
i am finishing the most execrable mornings work what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently my papers thank god nomy papers are all in capital order because i have none but m	1535.5812

i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics	455.1076
milady faltered dartagnan and fainted a second time	54.7490
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three oclock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight	325.3230
hallo fernand you are coming my boy oh you dont see straight said danglars hes gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries well said caderousse i should have sworn that he turned to the righthow treacherous wine is come come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted chapter	554.1433
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard	434.7907
the latter faithful to the principle of horace _nil admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught	9317.8799
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool enough porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe	433.9989
what do you tell me truth my friend	779.7968
bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and doublelocked	405.1059
i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivals attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernandhe was ghastly pale	487.5952
that was not the appointed hour	1317.3599
i have made him a spy upon his wife the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and retired	168.1347
cæsar spada well do you comprehend now inquired faria	1360.6882
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	880.0597
there are the fifty louis ifaith said aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of louis xiii	314.3933
_pardieu_ said villefort he is a noble fellow	71.7673
instead of going direct to his study m	181.2571
what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel	247.8932
speak then i am all ears dartagnan related his adventure with mme	1052.2037
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	509.4604
de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentineor still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp	735.7098
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve	319.3663
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it it is much more convenient at pariswhen anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel	506.5756
two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors	1226.5216
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father	266.7852
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most wellmeaning	1318.7733
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousins with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required	296.5824
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	193.2455
on the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry	3980.0024
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention	473.5637
besides the woman wore that black mantle which dartagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer	106.9947
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man young man said richelieu if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i have said to you today i promise you to do so this last expression of richelieus conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed dartagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning	152.4211
i said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the duc de beaufort who called for help	47.3118
so dartagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarins nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists adieu then and dartagnan poured out a glass of wine	315.2288
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m	181.4885
for his death the death of your prince yes how so because he has made his will in my favor indeed on my honor for how much for five hundred thousand only that	109.3636
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal	447.3670
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms to arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind	246.0094
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary	78.8164
if i am guilty if i have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked milady take me before a tribunal	332.1067
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	4452.7305

yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz	538.5957
and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning	719.6839
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart	223.2646
we should command an annuity of livres	843.9010
from two oclock till five franz and albert followed in the _fête_ exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	1816.2323
at length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained	124.8706
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand	962.8438
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	140.7782
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	252.3591
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger	704.2965
but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon dartagnan with sticks shovels and tongs	2938.9409
what are you doing said he	15.7865
once upon a time there lived a queena powerful monarchwho reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well	644.3470

besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	203.2819
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos	347.9814
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second	439.2504
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	454.3468
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it	186.1955
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback	110.7426
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard	99.6639
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor	338.4175
there was a dispute among the guards	48.3039
i have told you that i am prepared for anything the two travelers knocked at the door	44.0839
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution	1060.9014
there was no time to lose	211.4684
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets	120.2473
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	82.8568

have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path never answered de guiche	1070.3112
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure it is a wound that confines him to his bed ah and a master stroke too i assure you	345.2256
at this moment a horse neighed	855088.5625
at least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six months before us no madame said villefort instructions have been given	311.4498
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness which road asked the postilion in italian	466.9464
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest	1089.8755
as for dartagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pommedepin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him	194.5300

i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his the rascal is rich then some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more hum said gondy laughing i was not aware my alms were so well invested in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush	379.8772
his next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap	1177.9027
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg sainthonoré	748.5823
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porters lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here his excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali	533.6389
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before	310.8800
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted	361.3220
thats well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to porthos and aramis but you dartagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally	69.4572

my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	80.0785
poor cardinal seven men in two days and those of his very best but thats quite enough gentlemen please to understand thats enough	342.3650
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten	154.6111
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop	220.3070
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the halfhour	303.5776
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present	119.6483
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there	814.5581
then bring some wine said dartagnan	7.9540
have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred piastres the count went to his _secrétaire_ opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz	246.9580
moustons suggestion appear to you full of sense oh said aramis suppose the master is a puritan so much the better mordioux replied dartagnan if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens but if he should be a cavalier said porthos	214.9354
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely	285.3618
that is doubtless our boat said athos	30.6831
come then said dartagnan you are right	15.4787
as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she does not love the english but an englishman well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved	108.4917
the coast owing to the gascons stratagem was clear	10344.8350
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz dépinay	759.1166
noirtier evidently intends making me his heir	295.7177
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration	339.4382

ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo	128.6486
have you admired the rapidity of my fall	67.1739
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring châteaurenaud with you beauchamp availed himself of alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight	297.5974
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words	159.5626
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	190.1329
yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement	354.4554
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles	1193.2921
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a troop	3412.1716
another queen in want of help	1084.0710
well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man ali made a sign in the affirmative	147.9693
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort	461.3206
no pity for him who had no pity die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan	298.2665
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	797.9507
they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleansthat he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned	371.9604
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman	369.1543
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder	406.3700
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant	440.9641
possibly said danglars was not this murdered man an old galleyslave m yes replied the count a felon named caderousse danglars turned slightly pale andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawingroom	1328.2981
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will that is to say beauty meekness and tearsand above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness	3324.1069
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head	2297.9700
all the way along dartagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m	256.1679
the cemetery of the château dif on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was farias last windingsheeta windingsheet which as the turnkey said cost so little	936.2743
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray	87.8060
it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the shortlived satisfaction of his own curiosity	371.4622
i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts	361092.4375
he was well known at the hôtel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade	186.6186
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them aramis had eight of them	377.0515
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain	629.4871
after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet	346.3868
what will our two friends say	489.6974
then he must be playing in the garden go and see m no sir madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since a cold perspiration burst out on villeforts brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch	223.4428
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality	11821.7578
from congo if you will it must be farther off than even that but what do i know of your parisian husbands oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray	361.7970
these three others fenced against him with their agile swords	1745.2198
oh man manrace of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to diehe shall diei will not die alone look look cried the count seizing the young mens hands look for on my soul it is curious	435.6306
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo	137.6749
m before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine	157.7261
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction what	2200.6350
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur	106.9477
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raouls departure	175.9799
dartagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him	738.3456
we shall meet again master dartagnan continued the leader raising his voice	345.7220
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day	343.7020
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken	83.0503
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door	60.1464
the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy	235.7489
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them	403.9167
as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness	1271.9336
he knew this was the last struggle	2620.1401
at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again	163.5459
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	453.7957
in the chamber of dartagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	283.0301
is it to do us some ill turn	939.6215
well everything was finished as you know	41.4009
what the devil are you doing here count accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee	2022.6466
on tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night	3312.6667
who is he the comte de rochefort the comte de rochefort unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i dont know where he is i know guitant said mazarin	82.9349
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where dartagnan was confined	415.0785
he still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest	290.5493
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	253.8186
de tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist though	533077.1250
indeed my dear friend said beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhopedfor conclusion of a very disagreeable affair albert remained silent and wrapped in thought	435.4472
porthos had discovered the means _the diamond_	169456176.0000
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire	367.3039
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney	541.2031
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc dangoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general	717.2812
dartagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday dartagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment	218.8116
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii	2094.4895
no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back	216.1946
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice yes well then i repeat you are wrong	118.1818
de morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation i am ready my son said mercédès	116.8079
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the facevalue of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis	421.8423
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them	136.5529
in fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	695.8530
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m	241.0248
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions	128.0232
at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	261.4233
you are going sir yes said cromwell	76.6968
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz	252.3327
so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent houseno rue du helder paris the abbé opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at selfcontrol he said and mercédèsthey tell me that she has disappeared disappeared said caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor has she made a fortune also inquired the abbé with an ironical smile	384.6572
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	136.3320
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others	102.4236
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag	535.6953
in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country	1502.7063
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	1934.9952
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	578.0844
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tigercat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers	298.5406
in a few minutes valentine reentered the garden alone	398.0194
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	374.5988
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	105.8252
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster	3639.8420
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos	103.9212
the sea is the cemetery of the château dif m chapter	72.1756
they singlet them pay the piper	22580260.0000
at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder	101.9917
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior	97.1607
de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters gladly said albert let us calli love him chapter	2043.3959
de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist	212.4048
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand	832.4736
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of planchet faded away	456.0768
the devil exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord	235.5262
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts	185.2545
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn dartagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye	94.0155
i shall replied dartagnan and instantly in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascons hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it and athos bowed to dartagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts	143.3696
in losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray	392.5152
and shall we take no notice of this incident m	534.7742
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	212.1227
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time mme	142.1388
you and how by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring	1951.9904
none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion	701.8776
very little except long live cromwell where were you placed mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything	310.2845
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered	130.3957
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself to them or to us do you mean aramis to no one	148.8837
come hither monsieur dartagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air	2237.8506
a retired baker asked the fruiteress	96629672.0000
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing	745.3976
gaspard puget the sculptorarchitect was born at marseilles in	165.2307
now that i have the word of athos i can set out dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	202.8417
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets	1376.0273
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	494.1697
you owe me nothing but some trifle of francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between usbut you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself	393.3591
good caderousse he said how happy you will be i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife	274.0154
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind	6887.8672
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare	564.9745
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn	573.5522
the four lackeys guarded the door and the window	20.8711
he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired	342.0090
aha said groslow on account of political opinions	8054.9219
are you still resolved to accompany me more determined than ever well then come along franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino	241.4898
dame nanette look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet i am so fond of apricots broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine oclock	270.1143
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal	275.1862
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	198.9848
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo	642.8221
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers	153.1703
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying	326.7885
with a man like you i fear nothing athos bowed	344.2965
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks	798.4585
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced	717.6364
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening	159.4481
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	384.6755
so that monsieur watched bassompierre the king the duc dangoulême and the cardinal m	98.6433
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos	413.8459
the harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask	700.7226
yes sir you have not been long detained no i gave the customhouse officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom i gave them then you have nothing more to do here noeverything is all right now then you can come and dine with me i really must ask you to excuse me m	206.0123
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville ah yes where is my sister asked the prince	71.2587
captivity the first day chapter liii	13767.2041
yes if my friends agree but if they refuse can i count on you i have never accomplished anything alone said dartagnan shaking his head	122.5883
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinals vengeance and as was well known the vengeance of his eminence was terrible	106.1029
here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten oclock it must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris shall i give you a line for the vicar of st jacques de la boucherie	147.1773
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard	394.1396
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg works	29.7525
it was just two oclock by alberts watch when the two friends entered into the dancingroom	487.1427
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care	116.2027
as little sensitive as was the heart of dartagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance	337.2946
some traveller seems impatient said the host	20.7159
i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent i am not very clever at pretexts	416.4561
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop	49.0581
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	85.6148
he cannot pardon her the history of the saraband	274.9297
it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock	471.6905
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule	1236.0984
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret	236.1133
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactioni come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	183.8674
i found myself again in complete darkness	27728.1562
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	652.9108
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo	33.7101
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil	156.5875
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to dartagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer	329.5575
let us then hope for the best hope is so sweet a comforter	773.0306
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed	497.1633
maximilian said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood	184.8463
but where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	82.5984
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court	596.1603
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the windows	1389.9810
allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied madame de villefort with all a mothers real firmness	308.9010
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france	335.2943
we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	225.0669
all i can tell about her replied the countess is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance	203.2525
the vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast	231.4283
sir said he that man has been here what man said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected	365.1540
to whom is it addressed _to monsieur noirtier rue coqhéron paris_ had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupefied	914.7128
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me	66.9885

faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsdaume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project	1074.0320
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary	8003.9004
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate	3799.5635

lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpentlike embraces	3605.2502
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	264.7371

finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist	390.7812

another motive had influenced alberts selection of his seatwho knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival	594.7361
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide no no continued dartagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman	840.0139

porthos was in bed and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with mousqueton to keep his hand in while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell	1655.1278

the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile	146.2684
he wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it	97.6993
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we are supposed not to know each other you are right	78.7156
and so my friends we return to paris	114.3127
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak	40.9602
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine	2014.8513
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin	7754.9092
monsieur i love men of your kidney and i foresee plainly that if we dont kill each other i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation	438.0085
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead mans face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor	117.2105
what are you about asked dartagnan	12.6832
mazarin turned again to his papers	1358.2703
but i will take the left handit is my custom in such circumstances	1702.0043
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept	939.6873
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	465.0432
ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis in which i am not initiated	362.7260
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that dartagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	111.3880
m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	76.9464
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure	111.0486
night came and at ten oclock they anchored	1703.7168
then dartagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this dartagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	263.1528
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life	497.5480
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	123.9540
de tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment	59.7177
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle dartagnan and porthos obeyed	278.0153
in truth said porthos i understand but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol	268.0181
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner	81.5560
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest	582.8970
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé	73.5732
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicionabove all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again	350.0273
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips	432.0851
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape	1601.2953
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings service dartagnan colored	1891.6245
the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away	568.9877
noirtier fixed his eyes on her	26.6429
oh women women whether queens or not they are always the same do you disapprove of this journey my dear m	153.3823
the kings attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioners knife	958.1374
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish	817.6460
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	389.3226
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind adreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure	628.4266
both had recently come into the country	68.3269
the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head	548.2565
take care for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my swordand my sword is longi rip him up the chieftain of the party drew near	568.8585
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion	327.9254
may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars m i have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred	243.2931
hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them	361.8199
i will sign it tomorrow i can assure her majesty that if she does not sign today she will not have time to sign tomorrow	139.7954
m oh thank me again said the count tell me till you are weary that i have restored you to happiness you do not know how much i require this assurance oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said valentine and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée ask my beloved sister haydée who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you you then love haydée asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate	138.4720
one passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition	1141.6935
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	248.9750
the guide held the door open	640.1215
bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world	25.7860
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	775.9304
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse	226.9690
oh my god who could have said so the evening before	123.3221
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound ah hell come round thought dartagnan thats not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to dartagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics	237.2698
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but dartagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis	236.1256
duhalliers men and half of m	212.7896
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on it is likely well will you try and overtake him nothing i should like better if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before louvres thirty and if we do overtake him forty said andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise	424.0793
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again	143.7686
the name of dartagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty	194.8722
take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude ah here is m	141.7646
to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceunbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above	468.8095
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile	972.1030
anne de bueil you said anne de bueil did you not yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for i am dying i absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying mans hair stand on end i absolve you	337.6650
upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was porthos and not dartagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and disappeared so it was with monsieur dartagnan this stranger meant to quarrel it appears so and do you know what has become of him no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him since very well i know all that i wish to know	94.5280
after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened	423.5894
you are joking now replied andrea	229.8435
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	600.6014
dartagnan thought it was proper to follow this example	103.9967
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose	508.2574
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner	94.3748
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps	745.0210
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	344.8227
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos	59.1960
he is going to fall cried morrel	304.9544
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates on your honor is that true cried albert	185.8822
and who are you eh _pardieu_ joannes the jeweller well and you said i offended the good god said la carconte with a horrid smile	383.4961
he felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did return	6226.7954
on the contrary i gave you to understand i think that i adhered to the princes	266.5426
adieu count till tomorrow but the night is dark said athos perceiving that lord de winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no servant i have tony a safe if simple youth halloo there grimaud olivain and blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with you blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province	605.9257
bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service why because i should never get a better probabilities are deceptive but i deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death do you possess that right over bertuccio yes there are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts yes the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours	568.8694
come said dartagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing dartagnan what is to be done	99.9585
aramis and dartagnan whispered to each other	76.3919
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf	197.8827
madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing	295.5646
no one must disturb us he said i must speak freely to her accuse myself and sayhe approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand	464.3337
you whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by henrietta whatever news you bring speak out sire cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle ah exclaimed the king to fight no sire but to buy your majesty what did you say i said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army for unpaid wages yes i know it	394.7659
then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees	382.1737
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances well said andrea let it be as you wish	520.4104
i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost	140.8467
each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh	337.1733
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the hotel	223.2560
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master but how shall we get back upon our lackeys horses _pardieu_	353.3211
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity	663.5255
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès thats all right edmond	67.6078
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which dartagnan alone understood	84.3247
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and dartagnan was a gentleman	380.3967
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu then they gained the private staircase and dartagnan was ushered into the oratory	258.6495
is the baroness at home inquired danglars	251.9934
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression	3490.6113
hes not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do	324.1359
bythebye continued dartagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and dartagnan went out followed by bernouin	246.7709
he then repaired to dartagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own	230.1639
what do you mean by a struggle	371.5990
in an instant dantès plan was formed	220.1367
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles	513.3998
come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which i can protect you the beggar shook his head	307.8446
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked dartagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	557.9659
he soon felt that his ideas became again collectedhe could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	6200.6562
she called the maid and questioned her	539.4210
who is this caderousse some provençal it appears	3385.4724
courage take courage my dear mother said the girl	63.5704
all at once theres a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the deck	2685.8625
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made	409.7731
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	166.4529
i command you not to stirattempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings	649.1985
my father said i was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me my child do you remember your father haydée the young greek smiled	721.2168
suppose we warn the masters lets wait for grimaud but perhaps they have killed him grimaud would have cried out you know he is almost dumb we should have heard the blow then but if he doesnt return here he is at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them	230.7510
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs in that case said dartagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort yestwo soldiers and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers the soldiers are swiss who understand only german	324.6423
stop you are in a shocking hurry to be offyou forget one of my guests	1560.6550
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta said the queen	149.9336
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	74.7980
there was a moments silence then the carriage cleared the gate	257.3449
oh yes but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover	502.4549
going along dartagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not	204.5711
that depends when do you leave tomorrow evening at five oclock in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning	296.7206
really said dartagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts athos i cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that way	557.5776
my dear athos he said i am going away	37.8397
here is my bed replied planchet producing a bundle of straw	1451.1184
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united	180.5471
he stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances	381.2941
near the barrels stood selim my fathers favorite whom i mentioned to you just now	242.6792
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight halfnaked sailors	1094.0128
noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	108.1632
m what do you wish to see first asked the abbé	53.3792
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father	290.8202
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them	404.7037
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man	18.9552
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m	106.6748
we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly	452.0617
what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m	69.0984
yes his mother but does he know this secret then i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges thus speaking he fell back exhausted	314.4769
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know dartagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul	213.5510
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with dartagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimauds laconic reply	607.1528
the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracytis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m	718.8862
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	37.3323
what is the matter dear grandfather said i are you pleased he gave me a sign in the affirmative	87.1367
this cannot be the establishment of athos	32.3863
oh you know it tell them tell them and the young mans voice was choked by sobs	230.1765
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together	261.5473
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage	328.9195
goodday commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	312.8941
speak my friend i listen there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear oh yes yes exclaimed dantès and i tell you that i will save you yet well then try	161.7419
have you not hit upon any asked danglars	192.2829
at eleven oclock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them	848.7943
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	166.7455
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia	1824.1113
well said he was i mistaken she has answered you cried franz	183.0978
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	168.8375
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back	341.3551
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m	479.0662
but is this all that is known they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him on his track said villefort	109.3396
well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans duty but the king is with mazarin he is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor child ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis war for the king yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarins side but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort monsieur de beaufort	180.5161
can my influence with them be of any service to you oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless	295.8063
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench	80.2756
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons	279.0851
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour	175.2283
and follow me wherever i go to the worlds end then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god	157.2758
yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter	74.3893
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horsesone for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern	275.3924
madame he said i am an abbé it is true but i am so against my will	69.2853
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	1409.8254
davrigny in the same pitiless tonem	20642076.0000
when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence	246.4480
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform you have evidently seen and observed everything let us proceed oh yes yes now as regards the second question i am listening was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès yes a young man who loved her and his name was fernand that is a spanish name i think he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the letter oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no one not even to your mistress no not even to my betrothed then it is danglars i feel quite sure of it now wait a little	221.4106
thats wisenot for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the masterfor the _masters_ we may say	1161.4257
i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her sons arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs	194.7635
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister	221.1734
has he a lady with him jesus what do you mean by that	316.1977
now as at the moment in which dartagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance	533.5667
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure	153.2149
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside and the young man went to the gangway	2192.4456
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed hat	1080.1566
i do not know replied dantès	131.3844
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage	370.6209
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano the prisoner started and bit his lips	24856.3066
for added he the future cannot fail to mend i inevitably look for better times	4862.3628
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil	553.0230
you suit me very well baptistin bowed low	34885.8984
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	259.7966
no i hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out that is possiblego i am going said albert as he made his parting bow	206.6718
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand	128.7478
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	784.1444
who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst dartagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads	328.9907

happy rogue said caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed yes said andrea	85.9512
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause	175.7454
the joy of the king was lively	787.4361
men are so made and we are not always twenty years old	102.7568
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house	111.0031
he is a bully and so am i his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine in fact there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor	154.3142
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount	190.2979
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom you say either too much or too little speak madame	10167.0146
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed and you couldnt remember no well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not pardieu said porthos	179.8510
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	193.9981
well i call you and say to you friend felton john my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman	788.8721
are you ill inquired the young man much alarmed	132.3840
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag	701.1859
d february this is capital said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on they rode forward and reached abbeville	973.4175
he labored and toiled until he had amassed francs six years sufficed to achieve this object	1975.1025
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	501.1534
now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself ah my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen and whilst dartagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer	405.3687
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	1704.8440
the man came straight toward him	23.4660
the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii	129.4496
madame de saintméran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saintméran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m	1119.8636
four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	83.7122
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	740.1776
prepare then for your departure and never despair of us	152.1819
nevertheless to dartagnans great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely	9875.5830
lord winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly sowe will not split straws about wordslet him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through cromwells army and reach scotland there is another method said aramis	799.0389
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen _entrées_	100686.7656
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m	164.2575
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife	453.8929
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a postchaise is an event	123.9494
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil	1441.6050
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished	322.6556
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule	687.2015
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love	179.1140
whom do you bring asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy a friend said monte cristo in the same language	104.4531
porthos had been trying a new horse dartagnan was on guard at the louvre aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood and athos whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud found himself close at hand	214.2137
raoul delighted at the counts companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay	3700.2441
i must go thither tonight instantly that is to say when you have received my instructions	98.5732
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on	241.9186
one might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately	1265.6650
with opium belladonna brucea snakewood and the cherrylaurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way	614.5503
i cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me	188.8644
haydée had three french maids and one who was a greek	172.0016
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start	556.9125
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him	238.8162
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	1216.3213
de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king	73.1277
gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	366.4760
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity	851.7565
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit and in his enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight	628.7974
the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the colonnas does its honors with the most consummate grace and thus their _fêtes_ have a european celebrity	1164.4884
very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	226.1302
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered hat	1019.9480
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis	189.8981
stay sir said anne to him	31.8435
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night and where do the servants sleep oh they have a house to themselves	261.3847
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness	587.2897
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there oh cried the duchess i cannot make war alone but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favoriteon the honor of a duchess i will avenge myself madame replied athos do not injure the vicomte de bragelonnedo not ruin his prospects	381.0021
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham	98.3469
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes	161.1235
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it	254.7279
were you present during the last struggle asked m	813.9722
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month then you really lost by that affair in spain yes only francs out of my cash boxnothing more why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager oh it is all my wifes fault	494.3441
hes well guarded now we only said he would escape who said so repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale	468.8717
the womans lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered	279.2345
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	95.5317
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pèrelachaise from the faubourg sainthonoré	1787.5602
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	1257.8604
is it large middling how is it arranged faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan they are all here said caderousse briskly	388.9435
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just	282.2244
at this instant the door opened	73.3470
a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end	793.2560
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner	176.5131
the king threw himself into an armchair	94.8799
extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart	557.1813
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute	735.3198
at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to him	413.0283
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	235.1396
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	30.6073
at last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather	329.6256
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands	587.1716
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	1590.8641
not a step forward or youre dead men stuff cried porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit	2116.8992
alas sir no and i do not know what has become of him so that i am really so unhappy that i weep in fact tears rolled down his cheeks	121.4544
where do you come from oh this is too much madame these are my orders excuse me	199.4554
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse dartagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain	171.9962
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes	221.4597
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	313.5211
good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	212.4011
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer	390.8979
look well at that man it is he who raised your fathers head on the point of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant elkobbir i know him ah let him say now if he does not recognize me each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair	215.3476
dartagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army	139.7569
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii	110.4390
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	240.8795
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car	6141.9380
yes you are right let us go porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid	214.2283
his eminence cannot see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary bernouin reentered the cabinet returning in a few seconds	259.6371
by the female side i believe said the procurator maliciously	1208.0142
who informed you this was the master i propose to you	44.7248
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain	226.2777
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done	232.8017
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of aramis monsieur dartagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale	59.9285
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	814.9769
at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	161.7161
no less said athos as pale as a corpse	90.7393
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came	278.3007
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle	361.1200
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade	447.3032
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	152.1189
it is for me to reply to that and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn	73.4256
you have perhaps no money _perhaps_ is too much said dartagnan smiling	533.2151
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop	233.6478
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone	116.6178
one said the gravediggers two three and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	468.6940
what is it asked dartagnan who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his friend	87.2554
what more could the most devoted lover desire then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman six months afterwards continued caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules the very church in which she was to have married edmond murmured the priest there was only a change of bridegrooms well mercédès was married proceeded caderousse but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart	413.2856
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads but observe cried dartagnan that there is a woman in the affaira woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress beware dartagnan beware said aramis	475.7394
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _significant_ if the expression may be used	749.2087
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church	356.2220
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is	103.3063
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then sight returned and with it feeling and grief	480.3295
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation	178.4186
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	211.3585
how were you to blame in that affair listenwhen one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive everybody pities you sir and above all mademoiselle danglars poor eugénie said danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life no alas it is unhappily but too true	857.4979
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my fathers heart	180.5493
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo	113.7494
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead	369.3072
now go down said the abbé folding his arms	674.6892
i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes i can easily comprehend that	232.5415
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grandmarshals presence as easily as you expect here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain	261.8759
my place of abode is no avenue des champsélysées but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home	332.9153
de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor	24.6701
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail	499.9073
ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	65.9574
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement	322.4301
call madame de villefortwake madame de villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave	78.3390
he opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon	614.3845
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her	160.1802
dartagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	683.6759
a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared	183.6877
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimneypots	326.6664
three days passedseventytwo long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones	263.5521
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket	276.5430
besides he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother and that she will in all probability inherit the fortune of m	132.4786
the guards were unable to help any oneeach one was occupied with his selfpreservation	3477.4404
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of courseof course said the prisonersanyone can see hes a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper	319.8687
i defy you to find him who executed it silence said a hollow voice	520.3257
besides the appearance of the caravan was formidable	33369.8203
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle darmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events	370.8956
you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either bertuccio bowed and resumed his story	124.5977
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock	686.6204
i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons	1001.3141
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed	44.1750
as they returned toward the castle dartagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not	374.0414
down with the officer down with him was the cry	114.1587
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for _terra firma_ and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	828.5894
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment	2824.3257
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	75.9119
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke	136.0516
what is it said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock	500.1081
now said dartagnan you wouldnt be sorry to understand the plot would you porthos well no not very well then we shall go down into the court yes we shall take the place of those two fellows well we will walk back and forth thats a good idea for it isnt warm in a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day before and we shall answer no on the contrary we shall not answer as you please i dont insist on answering we will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence where shall we escort him where he is goingto visit athos	224.4832
the storm broke about ten oclock	4.5531
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms	40.8190
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage	191.1082
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort	41.9959
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear	537.8674
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance	192.9455
from seven oclock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged	236.8423
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres	118.0109
i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour i grant it monsieur replied madame de chevreuse with her most gracious smile	117.4348
i used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries	508.0764
peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente	2020.9045
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey	2013.5164
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	141.2072
oh yes it is she a voice of strange sweetness how do you know it the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid	123.4077
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said athos	124.4132
has morrel whom we know been killed	867.6746
above all she is very richat least i believe so said monte cristo	385.5813
_pardieu_ monsieur said athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman	201.9280
oh as to that i do not engage myself	185.0134

i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated	78.5840
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud	346.5697

i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutteryes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to dartagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn	237.7879
and all thisall this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	225.8022

faith i do not remember the name of the hotel at the hotel of said porthos by my faithnor do i remember it either it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain alas sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	198.7531
it is in london they must be found what are your eminences orders not a word of what has passed	141.0602
god be praised and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still hope	113.7808
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	68.3486

the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim take all needful precautions replied the inspector	831.5468
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter	71.9594
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor	492.8878
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis	231.2573

i might have gone up to him and killed him	66.0507
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason	2594.1455

bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led dartagnan into it	181.8970
how have you spent this francsit is no business of mine when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience	331.8197
i will tell you all replied anne	311.4526
adieu my lord adieu my dear rochefort ah monsieur mazarin monsieur mazarin said rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action it was halfpast nine oclock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishops palace to the tower of st jacques de la boucherie	168.8047
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable	181.5191
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse	8108.3174
broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings officers	1473.7538
bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter	274.4887
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done	208.3805
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	652.3426
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	39.5721
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to die	187.4802
excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets _morbleu_ by the streets cried franz	219.9942
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience i see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be aramis it was indeed aramis	174.1996
why thou art posted here by heaven no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses is aramis here yes sir he has been here since yesterday what are you doing on the watch what aramis here cried athos	132.1898
de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted withone that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations	2782.5227
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart	212.3490
no my guardian replied raoul blushing	917.4172
two men to the astonishment of dartagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier	544.3563
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor	1039.3126
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	1270.6708
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	268.0916
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie said the cashier	1755.7839
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word	146.8282
but in that same bankers study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocketmoney you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry	290.2022
villefort rose and ran towards his motherinlaw for it was she	694.7575
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired	411.3802
debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays herdebray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he	522.2395
come monsieur come and both set off towards the capital at full gallop	107.7440
oh i _will_ find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i _will_ find him though i dig forever monte cristo drew back in horror	516.5206
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	90.0854
well said he let us go to valentine i will give instructions to everyone and you m	302.0418
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	116.5241
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him	35.8218
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray	262.4329
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse mehe is inflexiblehe will never pardon me	391.7582
there was a secret communication between the cardinals apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria	180.4995
his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships	3648.8264
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	1040.8857
from the queen replied the servant	306.1054
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m	170.4001
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply	52.4969
do you understand me perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value thank you	168.9706
report to the king the condition of affairs	1810.4900
another had done all this why then was it impossible to dantès	163.0123
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows	616.7053
ah sir said dartagnan you have a wicked smile	373.4830
pardon me my friend we will see about that presently said dartagnan with a slight smile	98.5185
mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied	1442.7390
i love that humiliation i who am master of the universe as was augustus but where are you really going to sea viscount you know i am a sailor	318.1669
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m	273.1957
you are discreetso much the better	265.0672
that you inherit from your mother truly from my mother leonora corsinari how much may it amount to indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up	387.8017
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door	603.0784
does your majesty require anything further	639.8722
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement	246.6675
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknownwho hates slavery and finds himself illplaced in the world aramis aramis cried dartagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt	981.9423
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent	227.8532
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city	211.0342
it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athoss eyes	215.0322
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes	1155.9288
i indeed invited them here today on your account	196.2260
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door	150.2384
the deputy procureur du roi chapter	1264.8282
mr oreilly said the duke leading him into the chapel look at these diamond studs and tell me what they are worth apiece the goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said fifteen hundred pistoles each my lord how many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them	496.5618
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when monsieur dartagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of la rochelle under the deceased cardinal and monsieur de bassompierre	505.8867
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door	474.1028
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance	1187.6631
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell	177.1455
well said villefort what is itwho rangwho asked for me a stranger who will not send in his name a stranger who will not send in his name what can he want with me he wishes to speak to you to me yes did he mention my name yes what sort of person is he why sir a man of about fifty short or tall about your own height sir dark or fair darkvery dark with black eyes black hair black eyebrows and how dressed asked villefort quickly	352.8630
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but dartagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kittys apartment	472.1964
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered	90.8718
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	358.3529
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against sleepiness	1161.9802
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried	19876.1719
buckingham in paris cried he and why does he come to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards no _pardieu_ no to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés oh sire what an idea the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it	273.7083
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the wormeaten table which with the stool and the goatskin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell	500.0876
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	203.0388
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish imagination	527.5053
what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	615.0367
the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house	495.8959
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	238.4805
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	54.5959
baptistin give me the refusal of him by all means that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mothers side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search ah ha you will do as much as that will you yes well really nothing is certain in this world oh count what a service you might render me i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times	214.1687
many young men of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared	35758.5508
if it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good pieces manage the matter as well as you can my good man it does not concern me the more so as i have not a livre left come said dartagnan let us inquire further	191.3762
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	1385.7917
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke	973.1409
linen and wine are both being warmed come the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely	351.9435
i should not have guessed it	27.1122
then he stepped into his _coupé_ calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes	143.8799
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself	3080.4741
dartagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	175.8174
dartagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to milady	30.8721
i know them by their romantic imagination	35884.1328
begone and may god guide you amen cried the young man and set off at full gallop	135.5361
he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms	553.8923
come guitant come along and lets see if they keep watch at the quinzevingts as at the barriere des sergens and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined dartagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort	269.7528
i swear it before heaven and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward	3325.6353
even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass	443.5699
hollo whats the matter at the château dif said the captain	35.5234
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know	263.0376
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting	269.5079
they were said however to be of good extraction	1384.1460
yes indeed count said madame danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina i was inspectorgeneral of the pashas troops replied morcerf and it is no secret that i owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief but look exclaimed madame danglars	362.1800
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him	264.7182
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	417.2435
i wish to speak with monsieur aramis	158.1071
if i stay in paris i cannot go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur dartagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneurs resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin	314.3419
peste if he is giving away hats like that porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment tomorrow	691.9199
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefittherefore he has gone and i am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating tone	300.5252
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	177.6974
listen said he i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale	175.2789
and what will he promise us said dartagnan	46.8184
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked athos	478.7118
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for them	472.1414
be good enough to open to me for i wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him why didnt you say so said the servitor opening the gate	139.2234
but i am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time here goes the barony said the queen she signed a patent	419.7381
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m	50.9575
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street	74.7047
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it	185.9775
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy	910.9834
our partnership began in the month of april	125.6667
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence	846.8170

a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawingroom with her little edward	96.8689
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer	256.5680
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	325.2698
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	902.4543
dartagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears	156.6854
the names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he cannot tell you proper names are not in the dictionary oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father sir sir cried he turning to noirtier do what you canmake me understand in some way yes replied noirtier	255.4317
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed	464.7402
that time you had nothing to say to me i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second	72.7935
i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i wasthe count of spada	1429.7269
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself	805.4284
julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel	13801.9492
de villefort your excellency knows him the former royal attorney at nîmes yes who married the marquis of saintmérans daughter yes who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation well was a villain bah replied monte cristo impossible it is as i tell you ah really said monte cristo	243.9701

then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abbé faria had been his tutor	799.5825
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparationsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	331.1676
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	722.1525
to this question de guiche could not respond	676.6946
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room	93.2446
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted	506.2460
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left	243.3450
dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him	87.9273
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion rocheforts lackey would precede it as courier	6776.4067
rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution	726.6270
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it	351.9482
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits there are no bandits cried debray	151.9018
dartagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy	13.7486

morrel attributed penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the _pharaon_ longer	622.5818
now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet	149.7969
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals	744.6467

de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless	243.4795

yes where at the louvre are you sure of it perfectly sure who told you of it madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know why did she not let me know sooner whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day well we are beaten now let us try to take our revenge i will assist you with all my heart monseigneur be assured of that how did it come about at half past twelve the queen was with her women where in her bedchamber go on when someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress and then the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then and then she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes i shall soon return she then opened the door of her alcove and went out why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly nothing was certain besides her majesty had said ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the queen how long did the queen remain out of the chamber threequarters of an hour none of her women accompanied her only donna estafania did she afterward return yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately and when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her no does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket yes the diamond studs which his majesty gave the queen and she came back without this casket yes madame de lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham she is sure of it how can she be so in the course of the day madame de lannoy in her quality of tirewoman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the queen and then the queen the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired he must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or not i have just been with him and the goldsmith the goldsmith has heard nothing of it well well rochefort all is not lost and perhapsperhaps everything is for the best the fact is that i do not doubt your eminences genius will repair the blunders of his agentis that it that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed no monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that head but i know you monseigneur yes or at least i guess	283.6449

perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemys army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle	187.4989

i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself	687.3431
the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him you have no idea then morrel asked châteaurenaud you do not propose anything oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay you have a sister asked the count	195.3271
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	5671.0000
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it tomorrow raoul didnt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a piebald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	512.5826
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised	392.0672
but when he saw the carriage take the way to la grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the hôtel de ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with him	264.1113

a small door close to the lodge of the _concierge_ gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot	725.4264
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed	526.6641
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the wavesthat immense breaking of the oceanwith her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on these verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry	627.5363
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body	1097.0134
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father then sire may i present him this instant duke where is he waiting below in my carriage seek him at once i hasten to do so the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again	474.0693

he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds	454.7595
i also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons for a thousand pistoles for a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too many and you have them they are here upon my word i think he acted very generously generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service a great servicewhat was that why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor what that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	285.1983
you are a faithful friend felton felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner	134.1219
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at work yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening i hope so monsieur well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said dartagnan and nodding to planchet he went out	207.6215
