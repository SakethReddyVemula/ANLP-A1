yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a <UNK> not too much so replied dartagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient	142.4970
very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you	216.9514
go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples <UNK> with moisture	531.1092
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired	56.7724
ah hes gone to blois the poor boy wherefore ah to inquire after the little la valliere she has sprained her foot you know you think he has i am sure of it said athos dont you see that raoul is in love indeed with <UNK> a child seven years old dear friend at raouls age the heart is so expansive that it	249.7248
must encircle one object or another fancied or real	2453.1602
they both approached the window and through a <UNK> in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak	167.0452
now as i am not egotistical we will return to our comrades and draw lots for her you have determined then to abandon her to the common law said carlini	166.7255
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held but on rising from his bed of justice on the twentyeighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever	137.0707
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful chapter liv	431.5086
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking	50.4947
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars	390.8712
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at <UNK> athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers	1104.2380
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested	187.6944
this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the allées de meilhan	137.0676
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you	26.1828
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse	24.9824
this young boarder of yours has she tried to fly no that is true but <UNK> is another thing i believe she is detained in france by some love affair ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor victim alas yes said milady	209.1479
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris	71.1260
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond	251.0820
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his <UNK> atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	540.6246
what did mazarin do <UNK> suggested athos	11639.6885
de tréville <UNK> the leave to the morning of the twentyfifth	598.8604
you can come and dine three times a week said mme	145.5572
i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite <UNK> unless indeed it <UNK> your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor <UNK> clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who	743.1115
almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons	311.8488
la <UNK> gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal franz and i have to thank you	98.9863
a thousand times count returned albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down	239.5826
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh ah ah said the cardinal and you monsieur porthos i monseigneur knowing that dueling is <UNK> seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken very well said the cardinal and you monsieur aramis monseigneur being of a very	216.5082
mild disposition and being likewise of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders i endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword <UNK> across my left arm	458.7740
_pardieu_ said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes <UNK> and shovels	1124.4182
the nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count	231.3832
he approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and dartagnan could get no hold	114.1389
listen my dear friend in two words you will know all	42.2669
it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger	87.1000
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	245.9032
a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage held a gourd full of rum to his mouth while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake	311.0813
them tomorrow	13640.8135
danglars i cannot help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile	435.0826
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily <UNK> of his <UNK> partners murmurs and lamentations	1067.4402
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him	47.8807
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name	94.5966
you are mad dear friend judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied athos	212.3394
chapter ii	15394.3535
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m	79.0778
franz the old man gave no answer	97.1070
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point	88.1103
danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked andrea	139.7630
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow	213.3830
he recoiled to the other side of the room as he would have done from a serpent which was <UNK> toward him and his sword coming in contact with his nervous hand he drew it almost unconsciously from the scabbard	134.7820
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse <UNK> of danglars who had assumed an air	266.0840
of utter surprise	2989.1423
be <UNK> i am sure that dartagnan and porthos are at rueil alive and well but resumed athos i <UNK> to my first proposal	707.5570
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn	284.1454
my fault said he you must be mad what do i know of the grecian affair	61.7491
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail	133.6254
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make	421.3708
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m	122.7975
let us dispense with useless words	303.0573
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	137.5836
yes my captain as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking	722.9053
all looked around athos himself stared	851.1304
now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence	66.0482
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot the prisoner was led away	130.0387
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion	76.8579
yes had i died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny	229.7202
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more <UNK> companion would have taken weeks to effect	434.7414
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was	47.8150
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary	89.1169
gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau it is large and there will be no want of room for you all but as we never thought of coming here i am informed that there are in all only three beds in the whole establishment one for the king one for me and one for the cardinal muttered	111.7071
the prince	174.9752
religion and its <UNK> had made felton a man <UNK> to ordinary seductions	6985.3950
try aramis to keep near the king	124.1937
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young	94.0991
boy who had lost consciousness	212.0779
there are many stories related of him and among them this	349.1853
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m	579.6668
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the limetrees	104.5333
at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs	96.6626
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly i shall go he said to the queen well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris to whom zounds how do i know	108.7439
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five oclock our little <UNK> came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of customhouse officers advancing in our direction	492.1938
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished	190.5366
de tréville	2.9157
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir	105.1663
the <UNK> of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory	637.6800
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villeforts room who had said she would receive them there	54.5244
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage	178.7621
yes if it isnt contrary to the rules oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man	99.2628
smiling	nan
chapter	nan
oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell him in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper	70.9588
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes	188.9782
the appointed hour was about to strike	192.0603
along the isle of dogs and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another	135.2584
the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who	188.7717
have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding	368.3758
let us alight raoul said athos	228.3011
yes sir replied mousqueton	33.7557
<UNK> lubin my pistols planchet called out dartagnan take care of the lackey i will manage the master planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon lubin and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his breast	318.8135
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand	207.9686
an event took place in the church of st louis au marais	225.5867
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion	194.1028
with what view with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham dartagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation	223.3473
this is all very strange said m	71.9023
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running	71.3214
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon	258.9019
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin	68.5557
that is not an answer replied athos	35.1004
fortunately lord de winter is rich lord de winter is ruined for the moment oliver cromwell has <UNK> his income resources now is the time when baron porthos would be useful now it is that i regret dartagnan let us <UNK> them away this secret aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence	267.1558
<UNK> men and half of m	311.8690
of that which i am ready to feel toward you and what is that proof are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress oh yes said kitty clapping her hands very willing well then come here my dear said dartagnan establishing himself in an easy chair come and let me tell you	121.9967
that you are the prettiest _soubrette_ i ever saw and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who asked nothing better than to believe him did believe him	100.7937
i should think so but not without difficulty	227.1999
m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority	175.6438
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it	178.3262
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table yes monsieur that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it deposited with the justice they said it was bad money very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which	161.5390
it once lays hold of	7076.7407
before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with terror	267.0310
without doubt <UNK> and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	151.1396
get your clothes together	203.9814
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him	143.8128
the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords and returned them to their <UNK>	345.6018
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion	384.0601
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat	125.4601
the sergeant drew near to planchet	139.8479
we have served them to the best of our poor means and god will recompense the will forgive the want of power	142.0667
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly	382.9077
madame de villefort fell at her husbands feet	51.0907
it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i cannot take off my doublet for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself that is true monsieur replied dartagnan and whether drawn by myself	108.8073
or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman	183.2176
look behind this wall said de comminges knocking against the wall	301.9091
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy	61.7999
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois <UNK> enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	497.7511
i learned it since i have been in prison and that from the conversation of monsieur the <UNK> amiable man the cardinal repressed another smile	244.9488
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met	160.0368
which route must i take demanded dartagnan in his turn	186.2459
aramis went to cromwells desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis	179.1901
an instant afterward the three young men separated <UNK> to meet again at four oclock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house	158.9114
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis <UNK> round the light columns forms one of the prettiest <UNK> to an inn that you can imagine	545.8199
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted	266.1339
in which we hear tidings of aramis	225.2408
he knows her brotherinlaw	338.2349
yes replied a gendarme	108.7747
yes sdeath in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend	736.4020
where are you going oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	160.9964
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him	342.6015
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft the duke had already begun to descend	182.9885
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or <UNK> light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said dartagnan who furnishes the wine	1238.5741
i am not going there to be imprisoned said dantès it is only used for political prisoners	142.8953
yes raoul replied the count	38.5546
yes just so	501.0607
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through	318.7986
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth	176.9112
and you my friend there is a <UNK> for your trouble you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him	96.1250
it is m	66.1758
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request	466.4005
what more do you want and she fell full length on the floor	208.3204
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service	45.5154
what more <UNK> not rich	75250.1250
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and <UNK> gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of	380.0730
the rarest <UNK> qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of dartagnan they attracted his admiration	1063.5641
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la <UNK> she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch	84.1915
the four men stood motionless	107.6217
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the <UNK> fair round arm of a woman but twentyfive years old and who yet spread death around her	598.2839
the coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by athos raoul and aramis	340.6233
theres no second constance in the world on his return to the cathedral dartagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the <UNK>	256.7801
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends <UNK> to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of <UNK> which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing	310.7990
concerns an affair for the police well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than	78.5842
into his own recollections but god forgive me cried anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her i believe that you are yourself interrogating yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur <UNK> he repeated in such a manner as to bow the <UNK> brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman	384.8287
de tréville	2.9157
noirtier was carried away	51.9485
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned	237.3064
i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed	258.9674
chapter xliv	168.3330
it was completely deserted	146.6894
my <UNK> up the aperture with it why asked blaisois	2490.4995
are you going really that is a good <UNK> hours have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going	187.3836
well said mme	48.3316
one of marie michons adventures	1298.8905
what you tell me is horrible sir	143.1245
you are examining my den said aramis	314.1817
his guards taking him by the arms and <UNK> forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed <UNK> followed behind	402.9059
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control	356.9494
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are no it is not worth while well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece all right he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could	179.9889
not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs	357.1416
now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example not at all plainly enough messrs	311.0280
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort	165.7503
we are about to ascertain sire replied dartagnan as he rapidly left the room	71.1879
i have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to paris i know that well	124.5092
when one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence but never mind that my <UNK> and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects i will go directly was edmonds reply and embracing his father and nodding to caderousse he left the apartment	303.0016
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace yes said dartagnan till she comes out ah my faith said athos you require too much dartagnan	96.8449
what is the matter	5.3803
that m	715.1041
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass	76.5706
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the <UNK> waiting only for a call from his master to mount	311.9763
to his room	403.9264
adieu i also intend from this time to work on my own account	83.4264
dartagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose <UNK> mouth emitted sounds of distress	1301.1277
de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your <UNK> sir replied morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me	219.5407
the injured man had recovered his senses	220.2200
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties resounded	289.0525
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost	140.8854
then heres to our next merry meeting adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon	247.6620
bonacieux and your regiment your captain by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance yes you are right a <UNK> is needful still another obstacle murmured mme	389.1042
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good <UNK> we are about equal	199.2587
the brigadier had a moments hope	230.5290
a real father yes so long as he pays me youll honor and believe <UNK> right	1877.1946
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner said danglars	574.5078
no <UNK> <UNK> assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort	2468.0000
yes sire in solitary confinement in a dungeon like the lowest criminal the devil murmured the king what must be done sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal	207.3585
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts	99.0980
sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me unheard	79.0288
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet dartagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme	121.3013
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted	588.9848
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend king charles we have but ill defended himit remains for us to save him to save the king said dartagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos	148.9451
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is <UNK> and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa	293.8197
it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and <UNK> the <UNK> light of the lamp	276.9572
and you have a letter yes there it is give it to me then and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read	42.9034
maximilian said she maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be united adieu valentine repeated morrel	217.5366
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart	224.0339
i take them then said the lieutenant	61.2994

i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless next <UNK> day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested yes sir i was there and very	225.7742
anxious to speak but danglars restrained me	197.9736
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this morning chapter xvi	103.7730
come in gentlemen dartagnan obeyed for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself	201.0786
he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom	270.4496
de bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at selfcontrol and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum thats no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act	90.6475
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn	71.4114
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to flight	362.7320
my letter of recommendation cried dartagnan my letter of recommendation or the holy blood i will spit you all like <UNK> unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten	311.1041
m	nan
but said franz in his turn interrupting his hosts meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was m ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight oclock precisely i have you intend visiting <UNK> <UNK> you mean the colosseum it is the same thing	256.6870
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading _le <UNK> <UNK>	378.2180
goodevening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent	140.5421
about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars	223.3944
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount willingly then it is settled yes but where i have told you where the air is pure where every sound <UNK> where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature	264.9518
and has this man displayed a friendship for you albert she asked with a nervous shudder	312.8306
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the <UNK> being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood	599.4721
do you think i love you said monte cristo taking the young mans hand affectionately in his	24.8574
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	57.5951
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion	95.8697
it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès with the passage which united them	155.7354
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult	210.5280
m everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful <UNK> sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold <UNK> down upon me and the most splendid <UNK> about to be entered into	639.7428
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès	165.6550
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day	472.6007
i had informed m	244.0528
draw up this note for us aramis but by our holy father the pope cut it short for i shall prune you in my turn i warn you i ask no better said aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the subject	178.2780
well bazin said dartagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	73.1292
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but i give you leave to try them upon this one	125.8885
he will inform against you	401.0721
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht	51.5653
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers	77.2250
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand <UNK> he was	2015.6930
do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this amusement	81.6724
he is my master and i am his slave he has the right to notice nothing the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy	75.2878
lend me your <UNK> dont let the cardinal go porthos lent him his back and dartagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself	130.8020
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping	106.3705
felton snatched away the knife	190.4764
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris write to him <UNK> the time you are sure of your enterprise yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead	162.9404
them	nan
noirtier resumed m	298.9932
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile	45.6347
meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed	50.8591
at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse	35.3954
look look doctor said villefort he is quite coming round again i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence m	136.0012
what are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command	56.8935
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	130.5025
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage i do not think that is the case however it may be valentine you must not be alarmed	56.6765
come come murmured dartagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort	185.4838
a vision at four oclock the four friends were all assembled with athos	98.1919
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that <UNK> its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a <UNK>	1076.7092
my dear m	18.4887
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts	183.2744
each of these little <UNK> arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh	445.7487
really that <UNK> <UNK> is very charming so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleepingroom and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished	550.0460
with whom are you going to fight with beauchamp one of your friends of course it is always with friends that one fights i suppose you have some cause of quarrel i have m what has he done to you there appeared in his journal last <UNK> wait and read for yourself and albert handed over the paper to the count who read	197.3079
as follows a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance	671.2089
silence but you promised me whispered the poor mercer	165.8034
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared	160.5310
to take no notice of it	66.7905
at length after winding about for a minute or two mme	480.6391
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which	117.8518
it really <UNK> is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no	157.5076
other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers	164.4586
and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	179.9278
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice	34.3095
the flickering light of the two candles showed <UNK> phantom shadows in the lofty room	1580.6404
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance	255.9215
and this _carte blanche_ said dartagnan this _carte blanche_ does it remain in her hands no it passed into mine i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell a lie my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life then it was to go to her that	139.9374
you left us said aramis	163.3060

de saintméran and m	34.2381
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit	145.5155
get in laporte laporte obeyed	2080.3215
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst yes added planchet like the famous ass of <UNK>	516.5088
no kitty you are mistaken	114.4863
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet how my friend planchet	282.6253
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but youll die of hunger said the patron	314.4254
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step	219.5508
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	108.0819
oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross <UNK> and how shall i be dressed demanded andrea	622.7252
the prison register chapter	3404.7083
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos	67.2925
the count <UNK> his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind	273.0464
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity	332.1955
besides dartagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her	610.6180
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave monte cristo returned her smile	138.7042
de la trémouille commanded a little reflection	140.3547
the sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said who are you gentlemen two gentlemen and where do you come from from london and what are you going to do in paris we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england ah every one seems to be going to	84.1440
see the queen of england	51.0842
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish	391.1028
i certainly never will get drunk again dartagnan it is too bad a habit dartagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me is it to your mind asked dartagnan	169.9624
what are your grandmothers symptoms an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched	276.9409
see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard	126.1013
noirtier m	1316.8185
come come cried dartagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment	214.5355
they will believe he is arrested and that will give him time in three days i will tell them who i am and they cannot fail to let me go bravo athos noble heart murmured dartagnan	116.9852
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	162.9658
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	206.5296
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo the history is ended chapter	427.2351
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner rapid as had been villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	201.5394
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the <UNK> girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as	388.0542
powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	2175.5093
davrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful <UNK>	231.7040
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their <UNK> their <UNK> their coats of arms and the origin of them	909.8486
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting	69.6656
my god yes <UNK> that is the word said porthos for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty without the saddle said aramis	229.6126
she went to the palais replied the steward	89.2119
this was alberts favorite <UNK> place	18211.6074
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the <UNK> entrance of the tent	348.7108
chapter xlvii	241.6609
and what kind of a man a genuine englishman your eminence	183.7277
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at crèvecœur	134.1712
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence the <UNK> took their seats m	285.6930
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up	420.6311
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts dartagnan	3898.4541
sit down my dear friend and let us talk and aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which dartagnan stretched himself out	81.5660
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled	657.2229
then your excellency is going to the hotel <UNK> pastrini said the _cicerone_ to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on	209.7379
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	155.1330
it was on thursday the abbés reception day people went there in <UNK>	1884.3577
for you	15.3802
thus richard iii for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile <UNK> two children are impediments in my way of promoting the	451.2418
happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne	529.8344
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule	412.1161
so my dear mother i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger	145.7209
colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are betrayed	189.0106
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till halfpast eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on it is likely well will you try and overtake him nothing i should like better if you do not overtake him before we reach <UNK> you shall have twenty francs if not before louvres thirty and if we	317.9725
do overtake him forty said andrea after a moments hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise	188.7657
yes your excellency he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur	138.9823
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence who are they replied the duke	136.3872
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up	153.3975
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth <UNK>	1628.3147
pronounce one single word muttered dartagnan and you are a dead man the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring	83.9770
then he has neither the parliament nor the people with <UNK> represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of france dartagnan scratched his ear	267.4733
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man	55.6943
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand	65.4762
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous <UNK> of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray	305.2080
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london why so because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice ah but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like	136.3264
to know what for you would be all the wiser said athos	78.4414
her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight	290.0610
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and <UNK> thought	209.6130
it has been made up a long time said gondy	36.5346
at this crisis of the battle the prince who had been <UNK> de chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero	258.8073
let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich	180.3282
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber	274.0043
de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin	97.6122
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	146.1727
it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a	128.8703
fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athoss eyes	140.2730
milady is fair you say she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ah my poor dartagnan said athos	150.5661
at this moment two women entered bringing <UNK> filled with ices and <UNK> which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose	1189.5868
edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his <UNK> but jacopo refused it <UNK>	550.9156
they ask where i was born i answer	327.9778
project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the unless a copyright notice is included	179.8404
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches <UNK> and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens	811.4235
that is doubtless our boat said athos	129.8976
shot my dear boy	67.2915
dartagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet over	60.0138
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in	217.6144
on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who <UNK> the musketeers of france	304.9652
listen	nan
i am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked italian accent	36.6079
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galleyslave on his deathbed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion	271.1676
if so depend on it you will be happy me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me	167.9769
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment	101.4099
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence	129.8394
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	207.3046
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated	198.6705
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert	135.9001
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection never to anyone you understand me replied villefort affectionately when i say <UNK> my <UNK> anyone living i mean yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness never i swear to you were you ever in the	290.4007
habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning	74.4615
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor	291.8026
i knew you were gloomy and always <UNK> over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of	392.9789
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return	90.4283
a silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked again	159.2677
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest thank you and god reward you about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney	168.9376
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared	128.9121
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was <UNK> fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use	347.2675
m adieu i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte <UNK> certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose	193.7103
of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in <UNK> at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses	880.1940
i have warned m	189.9757
one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès chamber	176.6050
i can assure you that this <UNK> of yours is a deuced finelooking <UNK> dressed	3004.7451
at this last thought mercédès burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to	164.0597
us the old man died as i have told you had he lived mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity	132.3717
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my <UNK> rich even	101.3370
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so <UNK> and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the	205.6909
most smiling and attentive hostess	2777.9541
a paltry piece of business murmured dartagnan <UNK> his note	2831.4346
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient	92.8331
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	255.9264
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to pistache let us go on to another of his exercises <UNK> was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed <UNK> you not remember that the duc de	150.9654
guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the <UNK> of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs	373.3240
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared	90.7564
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	248.6866
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes	204.6501
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmers son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which <UNK> from a leather baldric hit against the <UNK> of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback	489.5907
milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind	109.4770
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month then you really lost by that affair in spain yes only francs out of my cash <UNK> more why how could you make such a <UNK> an old stager oh it is all my wifes fault	423.2813
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this	23.9632

not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	191.3366
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form	158.9547

at seven oclock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night	89.2941
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	148.1898

and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to delbeuf	230.2796
bravo cried mazarin they told me that you were the man i wanted	48.4436
can you imagine said monte cristo some <UNK> or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall	314.4926

he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the majors little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his banknotes had immediately converted them into an available <UNK>	570.3331
their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived	146.0762

yes said morrel it is true i have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you are you then come from m	58.0303
de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months	85.1231
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such <UNK> pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested <UNK> injury is repugnant to every mind	1228.2084
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time	106.3376
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual	292.3023
you are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friends then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes	96.7050
it was m	62.7886
has he gone intending not to return <UNK> ten oclock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton there a postchaise was waiting for himhe entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau then what did you mean <UNK> left a letter for me a letter yes read it and the baroness took from	168.9893
her pocket a letter which she gave to debray	148.5329
this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood	128.6844
asked beauchamp	205.8693
m why should he doubt it said beauchamp to châteaurenaud	175.0018
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man	84.4996
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen	354.3003
therefore kitty surrendered	19719.3301
look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel	187.6664
the abbé took the note	127.1937
but the <UNK> child sir repeated the agitated mother	4709.1919
nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert	170.2316
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip	187.1564
you have a good memory repeat what i have told you	46.6744
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart	191.5416
porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal <UNK> which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing pierrefonds and added that name to his others	342.7503
now said she listen to me the request was needless	86.7035
it is true he had been playing the day before playing the day before and with whom lord who can say monsieur	98.3641
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for myself mundane presumption i know myself father my resolution is irrevocable then you persist in continuing that thesis i feel myself called upon to treat that and no other	478.5493
for i am sure the count is his father	40.4152
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	72.7733
dartagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale	397.2077
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated	1823.3800
chapter xxxvii	463.0840
de saintméran whose sole heiress i am	180.4191
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost to die whilst doing a good deed it is impossible	123.8857
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons	677.2321
your turn my lord said athos	24.6480
whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot	203.8218
but his majestys decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours dartagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded	587.9922
the <UNK> of it	19923.5410
ah my poor friend i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twentytwo years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh	102.6899
oh come come but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase	114.1862
coquenard had ascended	604.6566
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence	151.7600
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterdays <UNK>	243.8268
oh you cannot believe what you say let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady elated	131.7279
chapter xxvi	568.5543
as soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform me	153.9937
she is quite well replied danglars quickly she is at the piano with m	96.3149
poor dear man he is innocence itself and something like a faint smile lighted the <UNK> features of the young woman	414.7509
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray	91.9820
now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table	913.4014
morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the counts guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural history	285.9751
the good george said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy	118.4182
that is all i had to say to you and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady	169.5465
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root	141.5675
there with all their <UNK> <UNK>	75395.3750
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person	76.6939
political <UNK> are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation <UNK> to the condemnation	1479.3800
that will serve us for a relay said athos	98.3855
faith you are indeed right not to return to it	55.4000
the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand <UNK> two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	323.8743
she <UNK> cried the young man	478.9367
see the prince is <UNK> himself said one of the thieves	708.3982
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of <UNK>	711.0250
ah wretch cried she you have <UNK> betrayed me and still more you have my secret you shall die and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden <UNK> and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound	198.8625
upon dartagnan	848.0859
short and stout who is it they all asked together in a low tone	171.8304
are you armed he asked	82.0126
yes sir he said in a softened tone	40.4833
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness	456.7715
morrel i <UNK> insinuating dog you m	41483.2188
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror	379.2922
the siege of la rochelle the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of louis xiii and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal	50.5175
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queens letter short but explicit gave him the clue	172.6196
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the <UNK> he is so dreadfully pale i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to	179.7986
find out	96.0999
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy	136.5156
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some <UNK> <UNK> we will recommend you to him consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself	178.5628
responsible for you i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you and do you think your power as great with the <UNK> as monsieur le curé told me it was just now i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant	106.3300
with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me and could you count on fifty resolute men good <UNK> but active souls <UNK> capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at <UNK> i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult	682.9141
and more important than that ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them ifaith exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the	176.2815
curate	nan
this belonged to one of his friends at the café de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of <UNK> rue <UNK> that being the name and address on the card	240.5419
going along dartagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not	143.1872
he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside	156.2013
no cried dartagnan no steel	474.0863
grimaud rose	125.2621
m	nan
one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort	49.5203
chapter	nan
we have said that at halfpast twelve oclock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage	45.7673
he therefore informed m	587.0392
whilst dartagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris	52.8317
it was the way in which he spoke	25.1952
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow so tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back again	190.8524
misfortune <UNK> the memory	55579.3867
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before <UNK> and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home	158.6245
de <UNK> by the comte de <UNK> and by the chevalier de <UNK>	1454.0192
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to dartagnan	287.0860
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis	110.2531
this child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the <UNK> and the god of the hurricane	184.9205
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a sun	218.8497
i make a match	200.6628
oh if he were minister and i were his dartagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin <UNK> what fine things we would do together yes said porthos the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest	228.4587
we have walked eight paces whispered dartagnan and gone up six steps so <UNK> is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery	442.3760
de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt m my dear m	84.0827
so so replied porthos	112.9115
i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known good my son	88.0597
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal	267.6022
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and <UNK> do not follow my example	526.2203
begone then to your beautiful duchess i will detain you no longer and she is not to be despised in my opinion now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last do you love me still ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a <UNK> campaign in which my presentiments	137.0755
tell me i shall be killed oh dont talk of such things cried the procurators wife bursting into tears	54.5012
it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings	180.5548
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this <UNK> which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians anne was caught she could not draw <UNK> signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep	319.3784
certainly you must give the orders for i intend residing at the house m it was <UNK> for a servant of the counts to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat	182.3359
<UNK> it or i will break it in said grimaud	182.0989
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champsélysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light	53.6659
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart	171.7806
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said but no it is not for me to be the judith to deliver <UNK> from this <UNK>	289.6027
etiquette had no <UNK> unknown to him	1466.7123
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible	85.7622
my faith i dont know much about it said athos	41.7419
morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed	546.7644
laws alone swamp our small staff	1523.4263
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a newborn child	637.2465
aramis and dartagnan whispered to each other	54.2919
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the <UNK> what i tell you <UNK> shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish	141.8823
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes	88.6607
was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen	145.8935
as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and <UNK> my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation	562.9313
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the <UNK> who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they	277.0428
carried to enter closing immediately	1688.9170
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him	115.5177
dartagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying	235.5239
my jeweler and my secretary the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply	301.1081
athos did not leave his chamber he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself	60.3998
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything	93.5636
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of	188.2054
the king inspired him	222.4987
we <UNK> a long time madame on different subjects of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous _aqua tofana_ of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we	339.8127
<UNK> madame continued the count with perfect calmness but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick <UNK> or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that	215.9590
it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand at this moment the clock struck six	141.1755
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church the mendicant shook his head	131.5709
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills	109.5938
milady had listened to all this menacing <UNK> with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart	147.7380
on the way we escaped	277.1591
villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight	407.5443
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice	145.9881
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort	63.5081
porthos and i will stay here the friends obeyed	132.9676
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of <UNK>	159.6552
these names are too numerous for me to remember them all and i will content myself with the first said the queen graciously	92.0018
gave me some days before he died come i am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively	143.2725
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do i have both reflected and decided answered he	161.4194
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me but i cannot leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped	104.3201
i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended <UNK> he were a real count he wouldnt be so rich	534.0737
well be it so said she	84.1986
yes said the baron assassinated	200.3614
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself	179.4551
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth	365.7766
_pardieu_ monsieur said athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman	105.8773
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures	1685.3564
five hundred pounds and where did you get so much money said athos	54.6981
he esteems me highly	8307.3955
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback	168.7670
dartagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	308.6445
what is it asked mazarin	13.7655
let us be on our guard oh my dear dherblay who can say whether dartagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal	68.8381
yes said the king but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men sire i am here said dartagnan and i give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it and now what is to be done asked the queen for i hear them monsieur laporte go to them and	49.3950
again recommend silence	48443.7383
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against <UNK>	584.7764
zaccone are the same absolutely the same let us speak of m	102.1577
he was <UNK> surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo	110.1672
they have closed up the grating with a board that is well god has made them senseless said felton	310.1224
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool sweet child murmured monte cristo	207.3817
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and <UNK> begin with his father if you please said the abbé edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one	153.2513
sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abbé edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la réserve oh yes i can see it all before me this moment was it not his betrothal feast it was and the feast	123.3332
that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested yes and up to this point i know all said the priest	426.3082
would you like to hear the story sir yes relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history	127.8951
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained <UNK> in the background	823.7026
at the door he stopped to listen	27.8116
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and <UNK> reflections	810.3115
ah goodevening my dear m	231.0687
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles	117.7627
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness but your eminence replied the prince	92.2382
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with travellers	93.4904
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner	245.2374
deuce take those italian princes a man too who could boast of dante for a <UNK> and could reckon back to the <UNK> <UNK> a nobility of the rope said châteaurenaud <UNK>	1955.0588
it was very hard the horse said morcerf laughing	145.2562
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening	131.8530
besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you imagine this woman is full of mysteries murmured dartagnan to himself	135.3771
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the	272.0125
contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife	318.9884
alas said she i did all for the best one of our clients is a horsedealer he owes money to the office and is backward in his pay	260.7972
baptistin	nan
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	110.9145
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference	118.3400
i dont want any supper said caderousse	219.8623
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern	99.5641
they had only halberds before now they have muskets	785.0023
mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the <UNK> and most intelligent	153.5286
for the last time will you come cried milady	45.0207
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so	37.2169
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour ah baron baron said albert you are not <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> like you oh dont worry about me sir <UNK> said	701.6270
danglars then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father willingly if you wish it but let it be done explicitly and positively	125.1679
and i too added aramis	146.7204
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions	2433.2122
but this is tyranny cried one of them in very good french though with a foreign accent that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine nonsense let us break open the door and if he is too far gone in his madness well we will kill him softly gentlemen said dartagnan drawing his pistols from his belt	151.8959
you will kill nobody if you please good good cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these <UNK> of little children and we shall see brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly	145.0875
go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out one of the feet that support the bed you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there halffilled with a <UNK> <UNK>	256.6379
were i in her majestys place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen	94.2709
but thats more than dislike thats ingratitude come come calm yourself my sweet girl i thought you had softened	794.5875
what monseigneur said dartagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself	92.5887
coquenard understood it	109.4467
de trévilles courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted	185.3429
tell me how <UNK> know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting and louis xiii	829.2296
no but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing	117.2561
halloo monsieur de rochefort said gondy laughing are you a boy to play with <UNK> rochefort recognized the voice	262.9753
besides i have promised him your patronage you are right said the duke	49.7908
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her <UNK> to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment	100.2483
after shutting the gate behind them i pretended to return to the house but i immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge i gained yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everything	192.5884
tell me quickly my time is not my own monsieur said dartagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble	125.3030
lest i should not merit it it is indeed a favor young man replied m	108.7073
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled	100.7325
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor	158.4552
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	169.1442
the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queens generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure	408.8244
oh i confess it is all the same to me oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your <UNK> and crimes would <UNK> for it what you talk of <UNK> madame messalina lady macbeth either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your	468.3908
jailers and your <UNK> against me my jailers and my <UNK> <UNK> madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening	1135.1598
dartagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de trévilles place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey well i am in a maze said porthos do _you_ approve of what dartagnan has done _parbleu_ indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it	127.9201
and now gentlemen said dartagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for <UNK> is our motto is it not and yet said porthos	212.7194
left alone dartagnan read and <UNK> his billet	4571.6763
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are <UNK> to figures like an algebraic <UNK> but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to	382.1937
the greatest degree m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a <UNK> the first day two <UNK> the second day and so on	356.4233
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything	348.8282
he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited you know not the subject of their conversation he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london was this woman english he called her milady it is he it must be he murmured tréville	192.3374
and where am i inquired monte cristo laughingly	119.0470
noirtiers room	330.8594
he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that	241.6828
is being in love conspiring	3857.9885
and it will be even a disadvantage to you a <UNK> man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it	191.8853
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard	105.1033
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of dartagnan who beheld in these two men <UNK> and in their leader an <UNK> jupiter armed with all his <UNK>	677.2618
the two rooms looked on to the <UNK> fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an <UNK> advantage	2041.7479
imagine a man who has <UNK> business with me for i dont know how long to the amount of or francs during the year	129.9601
nay dear mother say the accused person	655.5910
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god it is possible have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time well those	267.2440
splendidly wild days may chance to come again i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment	258.2465
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received	252.3443
i shall hide myself in your cabin	98.1408
<UNK>	nan
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it	44.5059
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed <UNK> ambiguous words it is true but rather <UNK> ambiguous	388.0849
dont you agree with me aramis entirely my dear count	111.1448
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself	235.3047
de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before	203.7148
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing	253.8371
where is her stepmother	194.7429
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have <UNK> to repress it	486.0364
felton did not enter	36.3507
villefort was about to retire but m	44.8963
a nightly patrol	32847.1445
he thought of his wife	26.3329
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	79.9181
<UNK> us see them here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table francs in gold and francs in banknotes	219.3551
cavalcanti said debray	66.6088
have they not obeyed me it is done as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure that is well do as i have directed you then what the devil said the host to himself	129.3342
but methinks i need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass	213.9063
he labored and toiled until he had amassed francs six years sufficed to achieve this object	496.3492
yes <UNK> that is to say <UNK> robbers at them cried raoul	4821.5293
monsieur le prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by madame de <UNK> therefore madame i ask you to look not among your friends of today but among those of other times among my friends of other times said the queen	201.4649
it is nevertheless <UNK> to my mind	3759.3535
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances	250.7400
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues	200.3172
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing	213.1783
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop then he passed into the dressingroom which he examined	85.2790
but <UNK> whom god created in his own <UNK> upon whom god has laid his first his sole commandment to love his <UNK> to whom god has given a voice to express his <UNK> is his first cry when he hears his <UNK> is saved	1303.5789
<UNK> at a given signal which shall be the words at last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you	294.1989
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the customhouse officers	103.9470
it was a superb moonlight night	312.8473
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own	126.7841
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	88.5082
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who <UNK> him are his accomplices with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed <UNK> <UNK> on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity	1456.6160
and my only heir are you not said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady	68.6255
what are there no grottos at monte cristo he asked	119.4953
fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend caderousse there you are beginning again to <UNK> to talk again and again of the past but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only oneandtwenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it	259.6634
i have since learned that he was confined in the château dif and i should like to learn some particulars of his death what was his name the abbé faria oh i recollect him perfectly cried m	85.7695
although the day had been <UNK> neither of them was inclined to sleep	342.1044
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above anothers	194.3614
the queen rest assured we shall not see her and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal immediately	80.8020
the same had been done for the queen and madame the president	59.4607
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin	172.0530
louis de <UNK> prince de condé who since the death of his father henri de <UNK> was called in accordance with the custom of that period monsieur le prince was a young man not more than twentysix or twentyseven years old with the eye of an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as dante <UNK> nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of	1008.2816
all the qualities essential to the successful <UNK> is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage	3128.0957
this windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before	77.3619
and you ive only thrown the fellow down but hark another shot of a carbine was heard	684.9459
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral <UNK>	624.3090
oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but dont try to bite for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage	78.4841
marseillesthe arrival chapter	74.7043
a moment later the <UNK> man was beside him	801.9632
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be <UNK> speaking a great criminal	337.4180
saved mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raouls arms raoul was but ten yards from the shore there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet	276.2170
i see you are spoiled dear friend you are <UNK> your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinals guards have so many proofs ah my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton	237.4561
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twentythree years of age said athos in a low tone	137.0899
the next morning when kitty presented herself at dartagnans she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death	224.6931
the fact is said dartagnan if men are punished for imprudence and <UNK> this poor king deserves punishment	1274.6670
de tréville was not at his hôtel	26.0267
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	117.0719
it is strange said aramis	46.3779
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended	69.6801
all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man particularly when that young man is a musketeer had disappeared as if by enchantment and for fear no doubt that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world bazin had laid his hands upon sword pistols plumed hat and <UNK>	241.5597
and laces of all kinds and sorts	3213.5864
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given	273.0266
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m	177.7800
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking nevertheless or find some one else continued dartagnan turning his back	125.0377
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé <UNK> from for levêque of <UNK> from the bastille	417.8633
chapter xl	234.5782
the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and cæsar borgia paying him most marked attentions	387.3613
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age	162.8583
the king had not yet returned from hunting	201.9600
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth <UNK> in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle	183.1833
the accused replied that his name was jacques <UNK> bonacieux that he was fiftyone years old a retired mercer and lived rue des fossoyeurs no	811.2266
she became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a <UNK> which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syllable	181.9947
in truth said porthos i understand but now about the middle of the rue des petits <UNK> they were stopped by a second patrol	194.2413
at this moment a horse neighed	87.4701
two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor	290.1301
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	207.0211
for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner how dreadful exclaimed renée turning pale	441.8804
put back that weapon dartagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated	229.2102
here he is a man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him	161.7692
yes i share your hopes the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent	105.5229
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried valentine	51.3130
you edmond on the <UNK> are still young handsome dignified it is because you have had faith because you have had strength because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you	318.6011
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted	168.5125
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the <UNK> gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis	108.4343
yes looked the old man	147.0549
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the <UNK> of the morning with its houses and towers	179.3987
besides it has perhaps been her majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so <UNK>	722.9156
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos	46.2250
dartagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of <UNK> and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile	152.9716
let it be a million said caderousse you can never have so much as i wish you thank you said the young man	33.4882
take these flowers into the anteroom or dressingroom said the viscount they make the countess ill the footman obeyed his orders	585.7367
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself	149.7945
as they stopped at the door of the cardinals study dartagnan was about to be announced when rochefort <UNK> him on his shoulder	132.6080
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	160.5921
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid the queen smiled	48.2300
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise darmilly that was the name of the young <UNK> to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her	316.5690
company	nan
i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours	49.1733
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back <UNK> from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of <UNK> athos smiled	211.6039
de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor	592.0035
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september	192.6686
this morning i awoke at six oclock	61.6633
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key	386.4549
m	nan
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	69.1149
he was called count he was said to possess livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme	414.1845
franz questioned albert as to his intentions but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor	140.8748
yes madame replied the magistrate	38.5607
he was young he had an old father whom he loved a betrothed bride whom he adored	124.6339
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or <UNK> to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service	276.1619
the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordered with tombs	916.9545
in the capture of a king his degradation and his murder oh oh cried porthos do you think so you are <UNK> athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant	193.8737
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening	101.2089
chapter lxi	53.0775
ah ah have you finished grimaud grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes	113.5440
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused	99.8899
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness thanks my captain replied dartagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the	109.6031
lieutenant general	31144.1328
he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party	41.2000
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but selflove but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs	225.1376
since i have the good fortune to meet you i beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your friends monsieur the duke said m	46.0179
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her	147.1066
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	226.0052
what the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a <UNK> with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence <UNK> throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen nobody knew a word of this enigma	439.7639
you <UNK> more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	181.1442
morrel had better godo you not think so grandpapa yes signed the old man	732.9880
now to supper said aramis	102.7762
two hours passed thus madame de saintméran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	60.0294
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie	241.2345
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count	132.1381
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the <UNK> of all the persons concerned in this <UNK> affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted	516.1690
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me	191.1019
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	148.9741
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to <UNK> a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen	170.1412
years old	136.7046
now saddle the other three horses do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece said planchet with his shrewd air	202.9184
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant	216.2266
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign	244.7448
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time thank you sir it will be well employed i hope cromwell turned as he was going	98.9854
give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge	162.8726
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released him	231.4496
an instant after they were on the deck	34.2562
goodbye count morcerf took his hat and left the room	56.6902
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to <UNK>	101.1250
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied dartagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host	211.4246
that your mother and m	134.0171
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine upon my word the drum draws near said dartagnan	158.4976
oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard	61.7015
shall i go and offer her my services thought he	120.3895
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room	99.2413
yes her hand exclaimed everyone	1250.2094
then you must know what her name was as a young girl oh mon dieu cried the executioner i think i am dying	46.5101
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the <UNK> of his august auditor and he	487.2259
went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual <UNK> storm which menaces no less than your majestys throne	250.6160
look dartagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of <UNK> gaze she has not turned pale it is lady fairfax herself said dartagnan	331.1722
the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her	361.6873
bravo planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master i will promise you a place in my service oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur dartagnan at the same time dartagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his hand	70.4967
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all	88.0467
raoul had only been at m	63.7331
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	85.8790
we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it but alas it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption	207.9912
you promised to obey me implicitly	520.9556
no one at villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	457.2858
is this carriage for me said dantès	111.2571
bonacieux who had sent for m	27.5087
go my <UNK> my dear gérard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place	312.6785
is our little neighbor worse asked dartagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth	157.9593
i searched <UNK> counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years	679.8927
you start for paris	320.0594
ah dear dartagnan see how regularly i live and how easy i am here	164.8212
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brotherinlaw	203.3107
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel	537.9230
ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor	67.8703
my friend said andrea i was coming from <UNK> to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me	305.2620
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so so much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	114.9060
repeat your fathers name said the president	26.2870
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure	105.4418
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for <UNK> that advantage would be taken of that circumstance	479.2444
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a <UNK> fork	1507.5220
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him	59.2459
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest go sir replied the tutor but in heavens name do not expose yourself to danger do not fear	176.2994
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos	106.1864
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience faith no and you dartagnan ii own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux	473.9425
i do not know you read this letter he said handing it to her	41.9284
caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse	399.5675
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of <UNK> appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully <UNK> to proceed	330.1577
<UNK> directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep	431.5467
oh thanks sir thanks cried madame de chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have a noble heart i bring him to you madame said athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him till now i have watched over his education and i have made him i hope an accomplished	89.0694
gentleman but i am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction	272.8825
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost	140.4197
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says	92.4903
one terrible idea pressed upon her <UNK> someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again	164.3227
suppose he said we <UNK> chalk out a career for this young man	1001.1518
this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them	67.9427
he used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat	1247.7533
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis add monsieur dartagnan my lord	74.7057
he reminded me of it telling me if i did not pay for you he would be paid by m	66.8764
then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks	677.8300
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name so he has but i like mine as well certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly	156.7203
rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make <UNK> i prefer m	298.4707
it is a <UNK> and the proof is that there were five of the cardinals guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur dartagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully	189.7548
and with this agreement took leave of him	134.0214
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together	185.7443
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a childs caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mothers voice when she <UNK> me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as	380.3130
her command was given	332.4976
it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	59.6035
in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived de winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation	199.3070
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that <UNK> politeness that most <UNK> barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	890.0018
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break <UNK> and bear him off into the centre of the storm	195.7960
useless to look everything will come to us when wanted	390.5928
he is the evil genius of both of us	215.2651
the enemys army extended from <UNK> to <UNK> and as there was no species of violence or <UNK> it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated <UNK> and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them	1004.5997

the four or five remaining hours before nine oclock arrived andrea employed in riding paying <UNK> to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankers in their gayest <UNK> them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the <UNK>	756.9890
bonacieux at home chapter xviii	234.2995
how would you like to have it	43.5752
athos was <UNK> as he had never been before	285.7107
let us be open with each other and sincere what cried the gascon do you think athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis no answered athos embrace me my son zounds said porthos sobbing i believe im crying but how foolish all this is then they embraced	191.2868
ah said the marquise de saintméran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty <UNK> these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since	716.1497
we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by <UNK> the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the <UNK> while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius	704.2156
their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame	563.9385
how will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv support a double weight the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir oh you madame	172.7937
the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing	128.4095
set out immediately for paris and demand of the count of monte cristo avenue des champsélysées no the son whom you had by the marchesa corsinari and who was taken from you at five years of age	98.1185
i am no relation of yours you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man	67.8723
no you do all this not i still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders	169.6329
captivity the fifth day chapter <UNK>	563.0824
m listen cried he pity <UNK> me no my daughter is not guilty	591.0853
finally he slept	74.9143
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy asked milady	170.4376
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes you are right cried the affrighted mme	93.9223
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they <UNK> they had been seized stripped and bound	546.3907
i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india will have taken some <UNK> and my <UNK> pioneers will have discovered some mine very good very good but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a <UNK>	561.8205
sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of <UNK> and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better	643.8589
morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m	124.0334
yes monsieur a most excellent sister married nearly nine years happy asked the count again	555.9012
i shall be gone only a few moments villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace	193.5759
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him	89.2414
the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin	551.5999
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you <UNK> cried dartagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell whos an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman	571.5612
dont you remember porthos we saw her at general cromwells the roll call continued	1029.7986
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the <UNK> who in turn looked at villefort	146.6696
in fact four men such as they <UNK> men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing <UNK> or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single <UNK> inevitably either <UNK> in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or	1602.4281
by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem	499.9068
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted	122.0384
fire replied the steward	95.1680
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing	61.1903
dear grandfather said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness	244.1133
m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentines death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the <UNK> <UNK> of the season could not refrain from paying a last <UNK> to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth	470.1494
m no he wished to speak to your excellency i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed give it me said andrea and he read by the light of his <UNK> you know where i live i expect you tomorrow morning at nine oclock	121.0999
andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect	135.1789
once more replied the major	104.6635
no false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos	193.8190
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond	951.7098
in ten minutes the masters slept not so the <UNK> and more thirsty than hungry	1085.8274
<UNK> an old shoe	865.1993
every instant mme	389.8975
in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get <UNK> abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wifes and daughters jewels and a portion of his plate	244.6651
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles	208.4008
in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach and reached the seine at <UNK>	168.8208
i think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not	52.1506
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy	481.2679
we are for the king and the princes added athos	54.4232
my dear count allow me to show you the way they passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his place	83.3108
he placed the young girl again on the <UNK> lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole <UNK> remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	290.7012
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and <UNK> were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house	274.9181
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerfs face	108.2547
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert	63.3348
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham	386.8981
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else	25.7267
well eagerly demanded all his three friends	394.0374
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit	267.6711
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away oh mon dieu my dear mr mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me you know not then anything of your <UNK> have never seen your mother	210.8669
yes my lord she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurses house i remember the last time she came as well as if it were today you have a good memory said mazarin	89.8897
but we must say at the present moment dartagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested	128.3858
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	102.9868
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal	153.1888
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him you demanded a favor said the baron suspiciously	971.6845
the closet was empty	206.1298
chapter xlviii	311.3479
davrigny i should kill myself well said the doctor after a moments silence i will wait villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words	50.3659
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs	22.8621
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from <UNK> silver casket and these two letters	1036.5569
m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going	139.4401
goodbye then goodbye till we meet again they had arrived in the champsélysées	107.5082
get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	106.4106
he had tried his strength to the utmost	123.1806
ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out	204.6265
the line he had traced to the count who was watching him	65.7162
the notary looked at villefort	72.8059
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be	206.3777
saying to ones self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it	164.7847
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword	124.7085
no i have good luck that is all	73.6241
but come what is this about asked porthos	96.3234
he had retired at one oclock under the pretense of being indisposed	161.0945
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair	315.8668
how can i go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall die by my hand pardon monsieur pity in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon	105.0112
his knees and leaning upon his <UNK> he began to lose his strength with his blood	146.1979
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was	98.1265
the abbé scarron	612.4943
mme	nan
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise	301.5055
chapter vi	282.5721
but will you be able to follow me oh yes your wound gives me pain but will not prevent my walking be ready then at the first signal milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed	149.9910
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	82.5850
my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me as he spoke dantès looked toward the spot where the <UNK> had been wrecked and started	156.2662
the rendezvous chapter xxiv	783.4086
the <UNK> was sounded	40970.6094
during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune then with that money he <UNK> in the funds and trebled or <UNK> his capital and having first married his bankers daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a madame de nargonne daughter of m	282.9915
try and find a <UNK> is one by that <UNK> which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak indeed	199.7686
now to horse that i may see you depart raoul obeyed	196.8875
you said just now that you had a hundred friends very true but you introduced me at m	92.9268
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money	117.2022
they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be ransomed	74.6210
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	128.0735
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the _lorgnette_ and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth	268.5901
of ours than anything human	2817.5125
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was <UNK> pouring some ink into the birds <UNK>	443.6166
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent	124.1461
at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice and said i want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon as to the man to be depended upon i have him under my hand monsieur said m	115.0109
every soldier must be ambitious must he not	558.5846
m a girl of six or <UNK> is a little younger than <UNK> sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa	1524.8027
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurators wife and not to say a word of the wound thats agreed you have my word oh he would kill me dont be afraid he is not so much of a	91.1730
devil as he appears saying these words dartagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much <UNK> debt and his life	194.5053
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m	241.7318
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor	125.3038
the officer followed her	71.2460
you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave paris bringing them with you to cours la reine	81.8185
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you	95.2500
i begin and without any <UNK> allow me porthos said aramis	709.2913
and he threw away his pistol	94.4792
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object	331.4209
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man	26.3096
i am <UNK> cannot see	6295.9849
here i am my lord did you remark that man who is following us yes my lord who is he i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at the louvre to wait for you and now leaves the louvre with you some spy of the cardinal said de winter to him aside	79.0075
if you received the work <UNK> the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work <UNK> in lieu of a refund	213.8725
the prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court but richelieu never came in this manner said the <UNK> boy	439.1323
edmond welcomed the meeting with this <UNK> had been one of his own <UNK> a sure means of <UNK> the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance	511.7303
what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard	153.6932
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him	89.9948
i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it have you shown this letter to anyone asked villefort becoming still more pale	121.8320
i have just made m	73.9711
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not	140.9085
doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a <UNK> smile	118.2146
in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count	123.5840
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	378.5111
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be <UNK> of the king exactly answered the musketeer	164.9787
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity	207.4653
bazin remained at the window	34.0635
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	177.1927
bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the louvre that was all	92.1765
how often did he <UNK> over it and pronounce the name of a dear <UNK> friend lost to him forever and on his deathbed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were maximilian it was edmond dantès at	517.3436
these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and <UNK> said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship	200.6352
and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment	138.3640
eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and escaped	63.1980
dartagnan glanced at the dinner service	332.0444
now young man regulate your conduct accordingly and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these <UNK> which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us separate	425.9877
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence i understand	67.5365
dartagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier	194.5498
chapter ii	15394.3535
what are you looking at asked dartagnan	29.7063
felton reappeared and without observing whether milady had or had not touched her repast made a sign that the table should be carried out of the room it having been brought in ready spread	145.7270
these were pistols of an especial <UNK> which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room	471.5998
and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness	166.1534
taste this and the <UNK> of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie	2630.7200
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to	183.8065
do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the kings attorney and thats all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke	180.1098
how soft and perfumed was the air how lovely the blue heavens and <UNK> sky ah then madame i was able for one instant to be alone with you	557.9412
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully	111.1777
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself	38.9122
dartagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat	81.6769
this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss	188.6150
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape	93.5039
now said felton we are safe milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted	109.9017
goodevening m	24.3206
i will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a <UNK> on each word as he proceeded	193.7900
athos lend me grimaud who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked up a little english and can act as my interpreter go grimaud said athos	340.5585
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as <UNK> wife could <UNK> up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen	889.9191
haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes	335.6357
under pretense that hes a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without assistance really captain said dartagnan determined to continue on the <UNK> tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french	335.1987
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly	39.6014
parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise i	79.3435
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of _la jeune amélie_	153.9148
neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more	182.6422

the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which dartagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence	212.5800

two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays <UNK> that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets	208.9110

planchet said dartagnan to his domestic who just then <UNK> his head through the halfopen door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine i prefer that ah ah you have credit with your landlord then asked porthos	167.3443
he saw then that he was with a poet	63.7902
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers arm	366.6447
i confess this staggers me and it has staggered everybody	1301.1432
your feet too said grimaud	660.1197
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrinis hotel	164.3661

there were caskets of diamonds cashmere <UNK> valenciennes lace english <UNK> and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the now in passing through this room andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most	552.6379
valuable of the ornaments before him	252.0634
rochefort passed at a gallop	114.7131
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal	86.6601
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous mazarin was superstitious	322.4910
this <UNK> is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible <UNK> that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of <UNK>	1638.7892
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be <UNK> with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and <UNK> integrity no one could oppose him he is allpowerful even with the king he would crush you at a word	388.7109
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in	235.2125
de villefort yes but can he understand you yes oh said villefort <UNK> delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him <UNK> be satisfied i can understand my father while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth <UNK> together violently	378.3141
it is an old mans caprice and is there no means of making him <UNK> his decision yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that m	130.4777
we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected to our readers	247.8841
on entering the hotel dartagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire	54.0599
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime and youdo you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body how miserable not to be free dont be <UNK>	314.9345
the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentines room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment	124.0418
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who <UNK> everything at home and <UNK> france as in europe your majesty probably <UNK> to god said m	1699.7123

i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly	514.5277
to paris first i have affairs to settle and they both set out for paris	189.3859
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	137.3201
de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine <UNK> girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid <UNK> that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat	541.0676
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	132.2830
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here indeed said dartagnan i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals and i alsoi was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar <UNK> who is	239.2616
very agreeable and understands a joke i should have got a lodging elsewhere the pretty madeleine who had approached during this <UNK> stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthoss words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated	336.9925
what then well he is a man porthos looked at dartagnan in astonishment	76.3524
you know the rest milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed	128.4760
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door	113.2638
mazarin came within three steps of dartagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the <UNK> turned and the orange tree resumed its place	358.3774
you have <UNK> the face of your king	896.1366
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis	36.5571
noirtier the <UNK> was the next morning <UNK> m	5722.7705

he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès	90.5660
zounds i could defy a nation be quiet porthos said dartagnan we are observed we are admired ifaith answered porthos	259.3640
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was <UNK> had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish	184.2634
he received yesterday a message from the prince de condé he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not returned have you seen madame de chevreuse she was not at home	73.6563
meanwhile the heat became excessive	2119.0483
made richelieu smile	62268.2227
four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles a pistole is not enough said dartagnan tis worth a louis what is worth a louis four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis four hundred said porthos	142.9899
he gave us some very fine horses and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own	169.7214
felton in his rapid walk <UNK> in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i	801.3841
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers	258.9532
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone	43.9702
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could	188.2913
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors	148.0439
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung the deuce they do said mousqueton i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war then porthos meantime asked dartagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey	229.6549
what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my <UNK> to make a woman of thirtynine look like a woman of fifty	313.6277
what fault do you find with the fellow he is a <UNK> oh sir cried olivain reappearing at this accusation	367.3163
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which dartagnan had hitherto resided	241.9547
m	nan
general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared	195.0820
suddenly the jailer entered	35.3412
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears	111.2750
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise dartagnans vigilance	457.5286
have you seen the cardinal he sent for me answered the mercer proudly	54.9149
dartagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	47.0404
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married no they told you then that m	59.0681
ah my poor friends murmured dartagnan where are you	35.3829
if we cannot we will do without him	111.7711
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank	276.5179
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	40.5279
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye	185.9268
tis not for me a private individual to <UNK> a queen from her kingdom	536.0392
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	204.4752
dartagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	100.5472
they both went into the house the drawingroom was lighted upthey went in there	225.5342
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair	43.4800
i shall return very safely to the louvre all alone as you please madame bonacieux said the <UNK>	268.9201
what no wine	1531.7543

this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security	68.0473
there remained athos and dartagnan	119.4146
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	127.6442
a kind of steward appeared just as dartagnan and his companions were prepared to mount	130.5452
madame de saintméran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	170.5856
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man	1351.3959
monsieur the governor was all astonishment	206.1445
what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your <UNK> <UNK> no you are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention no repeated noirtier no valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment	318.6634
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead	139.6329
the queen had just regained her chamber and dartagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly touched	84.4924
beware if i am not saved i shall be avenged you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly	53.0073
eleven oclock sounded	83.6870
the evening of the betrothal villefort had as we have said hastened back to madame de saintmérans in the place du grand cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon	162.8903
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods	459.7088
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me	71.1333
but you continued m	214.0707
you wish to ask for liberty andi give it you oh my lord answered dartagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you you have your liberty repeated mazarin in terror	106.4597
listen m	332.7848
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard	214.4968
dartagnan took charge of it	138.5729
andrea had fled	137.3497
the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their <UNK> boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of <UNK> and forms <UNK> and passing beneath that shade	2533.7068
but sit down said monte cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking <UNK> have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour dont mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself	170.2490
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any <UNK> schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the <UNK> that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics	546.4052
which brought noirtier and m	650.1558
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master <UNK> never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their <UNK> or <UNK> may turn out badly <UNK> what then why then they would be laughed	319.5723
at and a master <UNK> must never be laughed at and what have master <UNK> to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	604.0302
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish	62.0850
the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> properly speaking not a jessamine at all has yellow blossoms	129861.5625
mercédès and albert were in that room	94.7632
goodday to you have you slept well excellently athos but what are you looking for	215.3385
behind dartagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak	65.7798
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed <UNK> own eyes streaming with tears	246.6223
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your <UNK> an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled several persons hurried up to m	281.2609
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos	51.5597
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for	148.1644
no replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori	117.1592
the soldier went out leaving the dinner served	224.5803
be content i will depart but you will not follow me you will not watch me i will return home instantly ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme	66.3089
the gratitude of anne of austria	55.8401

inflexible man she murmured	467.9309
we have <UNK> cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in <UNK> mazarin you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into truly athos interrupted dartagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which <UNK> would be ashamed of	402.4709
porthos was discontented with his condition	517.9392
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius recall le <UNK> <UNK> villequier and <UNK> said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys	731.5742
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly	257.5688
my horses said monte cristo	37.6986
de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past	81.1339
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea besides we are conversing in italian well then replied the major they paid me francs down monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them you have then been induced to alter your opinion you	202.6154
have had some proofs of their truth the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold	137.3932
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m	1977.6592
do you think he would recollect you my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me well go and talk with the boy said dartagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not	106.0277
at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible while dartagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of <UNK>	217.4562
m before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine	128.9033

i had acted hastily towards him	353.7714
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the <UNK> the bacon and sausages	695.9804
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses	98.8197
youll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow by this arrangement dartagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis	207.5315
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently	109.3260
thats well	36.9294
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo	148.6898
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those <UNK> are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her sons arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count	174.8909
as for m	42.4092
now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs i shall still have my place no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents message oh sir what are you proposing a jest sir unless you force me i think i can effectually force you and monte cristo drew another packet from his	136.5179
pocket	nan

and then i also wish to see a notary that i may be assured that all our property returns to valentine ah grandmamma murmured valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me	86.9283
silence said dartagnan pressing her hand more closely	59.4316
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress but milady started up pushing her away	158.7845
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder	174.0991
besides we must try our own arms bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless manner	157.6780
my god my god good god good god added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that	56.0599

leagues apart along the northern and southern road your excellency may depend upon me the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the bankers house	299.2422
valentine carried the <UNK> to her mouth and swallowed it	312.4133
i thought you would never come in whats the matter now planchet demanded dartagnan	132.5808
m chapter	124.5925
the three young people were talking together	81.5373
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	84.7058

and she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window help help for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people help comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a <UNK> voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard <UNK> murder fire assassins	749.6490
master broussel is being killed master broussel is being strangled it was <UNK> voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her <UNK> <UNK>	2619.5906
you are inclining toward false <UNK> my young friend you will be lost you will be lost said the curate shaking his head sorrowfully	181.3637
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most intimate of his friends	96.0133
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after them	105.5768
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them then <UNK> madame m	740.5469
i have this said he	67.8874
oh no said kitty it is not me you love it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man	96.1256
is that in love everyone for herself then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the _soubrette_	293.6002
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur	89.6731
you face the insinuations of the <UNK> and the <UNK> but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head	774.6985
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman	43.2191
at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	110.5201
return to camp and you shall know rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a days journey from surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them	91.5324
then i confess to you that i have eaten nothing since ten oclock this morning and i am <UNK> hungry we will dine directly my friend only you must please to remember that this is friday	175.3273
i hold this serpent in my hands	206.8934
well three days after that you talked politics with m	317.9808
an old proverb says like master like man let us pass then from the valet of athos to the valet of porthos from grimaud to mousqueton	234.6839
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever	262.2830
it appeared likewise that mme	289.8808
they ordered the lackeys not to <UNK> the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately	148.0126
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain	212.6527
i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself	115.5837
let us go and die with them said the king	17.8233
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer	399.3841
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man	50.9947
zaccone ah indeed and when a child i often played with the son in the <UNK> but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty	219.0762
to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples	110.7713
or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count	121.2076
and could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it	306.6133
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger	65.6307
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the <UNK>	744.2480
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry	52.3717
no you do not know me i have done all in my power to oppose it ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend alberts account on my account said the young man oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is	79.6849

i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself you could do no such thing fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i cannot give you	212.7190
more well i will do better mercédès	149.0672
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent	82.5593
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living do you see said caderousse all my happiness is <UNK> by one thought what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own <UNK> honestly do not let that disturb you i have enough	364.7835
for two no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse good caderousse so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me true remorse and besides an idea had struck me andrea shuddered he	134.0602
always did so at caderousses ideas	1245.6210
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly <UNK> sir if you please and my master lord <UNK>	433.7697
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	76.2110
ah really this is magnificent but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear <UNK> understand i mean because he wants <UNK>	484.0019
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height	179.7655
you go to madame <UNK> and you pay your court to her you go to madame de <UNK> the cousin of madame de chevreuse and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady	266.8231
bonacieux	nan
this world was not then so good as doctor <UNK> believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the <UNK> manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall	222.5069
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock i shall see what color his is then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp	174.2207
it may be judged whether dartagnan looked or listened with avidity	1540.5947
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment dartagnan entered	195.1024
is your horse tired tired	1038.2704
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my motherinlaw and madame de longueville	94.5270
no no said fernand restraining him stay it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès	150.8143
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	89.2085
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn <UNK> would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example	108.1016
you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i require	63.2134
does he <UNK> with aramis	6635.5425
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of dartagnan	82.5076
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy	151.0169
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman <UNK> with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding	409.0100
is the deed of sale ready yes count have you brought it here it is very well and where is this house that i purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary	163.7036
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have <UNK> in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you	320.5593
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations	468.3242
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes	56.6801
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which dartagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	132.0719
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance	286.2068
all london was <UNK> to the doors of the house	512.0085
our béarnais was a prudent lad however young he might be	490.7432
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m	46.1265
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met	41.5407
and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation	482.3456
all hands to the <UNK> i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we <UNK> the more came in	611.9396
the trial	684.7704
i will do as children do for fear of losing the <UNK> the name along the route	756.9179
he has come thought milady	476.3055
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort	12.2974
the superior education of dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy	343.2922
what is he waiting for asked another	91.4785
he still lives are you quite sure of it i am he there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature	113.4855
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the <UNK> that had lodged in a hollow of the rock	407.4731
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped	43.7049
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him	97.1355
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race i am highly flattered returned beauchamp	139.3666
this was before his servant came	114.6873
dessessart	nan
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis	67.2366
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girls arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child	107.1385
at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase	108.3943
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard	490.4679
close the door said la carconte i do not like open doors when it <UNK> particularly when there is money in the house eh answered caderousse <UNK> the door	374.9467
do you promise i swear to you i will it is well	32.8733
i went up to him as he was singing a love <UNK> and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet	285.6205
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo	182.3737
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with motherofpearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor	348.0881
where is providence my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal him my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart	113.8568
he then arose	136.3895
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	531.1044
aramis smiled as one who hopes	511.5354
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him pardon me said he but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no	141.9870
part in it by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and <UNK> above all the world i swear it be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal	226.1825
the count felt his heart beat more rapidly	127.5417
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis xiii	149.9681
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained	140.0065
m here is said the englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of francs to our house by m	84.3393
oh i <UNK> find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i <UNK> find him though i dig forever monte cristo drew back in horror	592.2872
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at ones <UNK> for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to gain and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion well	283.5129
my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil that of bracieux in the <UNK> and that of pierrefonds in the <UNK>	627.5465
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day	246.7785
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in	361.8092
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him	740.9100
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	122.9762
but dress yourself see m	1189.1296
at six oclock villefort retired to his study at eight m	143.9149
the three friends looked on panting and astonished	189.2006
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the	354.1076
unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you	426.6744
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the <UNK>	3478.5251
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that <UNK> the devil are their <UNK> and porthos dartagnan and porthos ah yes	209.9742
then adieu valentine valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them	105.5292
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of dartagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last monsieur dartagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a	93.2125
hollow tone monsieur dartagnan shall die indeed is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	175.0532
even before the coachman had hailed the _concierge_ the massy gates rolled on their <UNK> had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning	386.4254
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone	142.7529
oh i see you prefer <UNK>	3129.3728
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars	186.6203
my mother gave it him and as she did so looked <UNK> than the marble against which she leaned	444.7442
i cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant	75.5646
women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris but know that if you had even hidden your <UNK> from your husband who has but the commencement of the <UNK> generally husbands <UNK> not <UNK> would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the	613.1713
world	nan
the devil said porthos	37.5595
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings	393.1438
sdeath he cried with his gascon accent	67.8297
the horses only arrived at two oclock and the _cicerone_ did not bring the passport till three	90.5007
then turning toward the second musketeer dartagnan said monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	167.4205
villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage	927.1485
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbé	328.2450
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	126.2389
you know the rest	66.0899
that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the <UNK> understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your <UNK> call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government	1053.2017
all day he toiled on <UNK> and by the evening he had succeeded in <UNK> ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone	570.5656
the escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to wait	71.9643
do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall	31.3559
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse	428.9727
i had chosen this <UNK> me dear dartagnan if it is not to your <UNK> inutile est desiderium in oblatione_ that is a little regret is not <UNK> in an offering to the lord stop there cried the jesuit for that thesis touches closely upon <UNK>	1825.9606
adieu sir she said	37.2342
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor	69.3088
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death <UNK> and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane insane raving mad his head becomes weaker	355.4020
chapter xxxvi	57.6568
_peste_ matters are going all right should you know those doors again yes do you know the numbers yes what are they no in the rue de vaugirard in the rue de la harpe thats well said the cardinal	98.1646
oh i am dying oh save me a pen a pen said the doctor	92.7844
i believe so replied aramis	82.2189
the latter had surpassed himself he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with monsieur de <UNK> coatofarms	1458.4954
andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m	249.0572
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand	167.1992

we want money for our return to paris i am much attached to that horse athos and there again you are wrong	92.3629
cavalcanti	nan
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution well then i will content myself with arresting you madame the possibility of my arrest has	130.0316
been foreseen and should i not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or	130.9273
six times that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and delbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him your pardon madame i know all that	119.5988
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans	62.3815
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of <UNK> which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of <UNK>	660.2881
what is the meaning of that noise oh my god cried morrel turning pale what is it a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled sobs	131.4084
dartagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god	190.1451
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven oclock she was at the fort of the point at eight oclock she had embarked and at nine the vessel which with letters of <UNK> from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne raised anchor and <UNK> its course toward england	251.0738
i claim then the right to choose my opponent	562.0084
morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the <UNK> effect of all that he saw	523.3980
chapter lxxxi	501.3501
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my fathers love	269.3062
she was branded athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand	185.7301
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a doorkeeper	114.5700
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet	194.4670
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his <UNK> i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting	354.9264
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	51.3993
the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved and this constitutes the <UNK> of human fortune	604.8057
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you you have said puritans have but one word	138.9863
the cry proceeded from the grotto	380.6405
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three illlooking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frockcoat and hat with broad brim	126.0401
on saturday at six oclock	78.3301
in the old greek legend the atreidae or children of <UNK> were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father	878.8481
questions and answers followed in a <UNK> manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own	341.5417
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your <UNK> thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a <UNK> grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to	294.7870

you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door certainly your excellency	161.9491
dartagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so	227.7251
on the doorsteps davrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he <UNK> of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others	432.1595
dont condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this the same password exactly adieu master a good journey gentlemen do you want anything dartagnan shook his head and set off at full speed	213.3338
when they met they looked <UNK> at one another as much as to say have you found anything however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act	196.2763
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the kings commissioner la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window	137.4301
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it	68.2183
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine grimaud hastened to awake dartagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place	116.1819
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really <UNK> and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	289.8711
it will be happier i think than ours has been	256.4419
mute with horror the three friends had remained <UNK> their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible	243.1989
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply oh said dartagnan this is rather warm it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person	158.0048

while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	142.3790
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three steps forward	199.1889
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	106.2502

one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude	550.5784

of risk and danger	3551.5842
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but dartagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down tonight upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur dartagnan to the	146.8140
end of the world	11.2816

he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent <UNK> for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern	193.5681

to save a man to spare a fathers feelings or a mothers sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus	145.8682

is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied dartagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into <UNK> houses	117.3145

as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him france will <UNK> the acts of the english nation and thus so <UNK> harm england and especially the <UNK> of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and	765.1361
paused to glance under his eyes at the young man	48.8907
count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own maximilian you know i have no relation in the world	37.9713
here monsieur mazarin is everything does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england oh no he is a subtle <UNK> italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament more reason	411.7993
then he should protect a king pursued by parliament the queen shook her head despairingly	208.6189

my misgivings had been but too true	646.4000
nothing good replied dartagnan shaking his head	43.7953

not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love true replied franz	298.0640
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others	169.5551
either from chance or from illluck or from some natural defect or impediment remain halfway upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations	738.2935

undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is <UNK> and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	161.1571

the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the kings name were powerless against this formidable multitudeseemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more when at the shout in the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms illtreated he sprang into the <UNK> sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards	338.0939
you do not know your own good fortune and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing	55.1927
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness	600.0970
the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtiers old servant who had heard the noise from his masters room and run there also remaining behind the others	179.9810
they are quite new and have not yet been used	127.2628

so that now it is no longer hatred but vengeance indeed and the queen believes well what does the queen believe she believes that someone has written to the duke of buckingham in her name in the queens name yes to make him come to paris and when once come to paris to draw him into some snare the devil but your wife	94.4830
monsieur what has she to do with all this her devotion to the queen is known and they wish either to remove her from her mistress or to intimidate her in order to obtain her majestys secrets or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy that is likely said dartagnan but the man who has abducted <UNK> you know	116.9500

and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	1426.5944
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a <UNK> cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful <UNK> leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear	344.3081
was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward	204.3913

you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses that is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our blood	242.3838

i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on	167.0525
her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we	160.3969

but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others m	138.1349
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here	357.9615
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden <UNK>	377.1065
she was charming	110.7508

m general dépinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the <UNK> that he missed his aim and fell	259.9008
all at once the horse stumbled against a <UNK> and then placed its foot on the sand	411.6814
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows	119.6690
in truth that italian <UNK> does not deserve the services of an honest man dartagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anteroom	146.6758
live maximilian and i will be yours	75.7730

well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	65.1119
i understand you fernand you would be revenged on him because i do not love you you would cross your catalan knife with his <UNK>	191.6961
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb	332.5588
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	237.5614
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do well it is true said anne of austria and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully	87.3220
it has always been against the policy of <UNK> governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear	657.1643

i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly <UNK> irish or <UNK>	649.1883
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants	135.3361
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before <UNK> letters of unlimited credit i can be no longer <UNK> but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment nay answered monte cristo with	248.0037
the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded	812.6130

what man is that	50.7434
they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of <UNK> function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to <UNK> prefer my own specific undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask	395.1850

silence silence begone said kitty	460.9719
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a <UNK> sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	310.3631
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf	208.9569
aramis blushed	1503.3413
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for the voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the partition	282.2738
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house	528.0580
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs <UNK> outside	417.8253
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	392.1908
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back	112.4842
de blacas taking his hand restrained him	134.0735
we were but the instruments that is all but as to free will aramis how acts the judge	502.1700
farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st jean where state criminals were buried	299.9351
come said dartagnan let us go and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses <UNK> with foam and dark with perspiration	258.4153
the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door	102.3926

yes but in order to avenge herself she must be free	57.1315
yes	nan
should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it	190.2039
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched	103.0568
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	107.4032
then you must suffer hunger suffer hunger said danglars becoming pale	324.3618
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	194.4453
de villefort said the king come in villefort bowed and advancing a few steps waited until the king should interrogate him	120.5297
undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery not to me i hope no not to you so i am going to tell you where he is porthos devoured dartagnan with wondering eyes	94.3017
i must and will see him again	93.2374
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the <UNK> king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air _à <UNK> and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair <UNK> strewed the table with their <UNK> treasures	2909.4048
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressingroom which led by a side staircase down to the <UNK> going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle darmilly scarcely raised with both hands	382.5790

woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied	163.5393
together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs <UNK> to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her	383.3942
dartagnan here himself but thats impossible he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal	95.1099
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign	142.5399
_pardieu_ cried dartagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get cold can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his friends	100.1111
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	117.5410
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd <UNK> continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate	320.8457
ah la ramee if you would but accept my offers i would make your fortune how	158.9012
what were you saying to this youngster my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in <UNK> times and that todays events are very like those in the days of the ligue of which i heard so much in my youth	210.7113
i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her <UNK> while the father talks to you if you compliment her at all let it be on her voice at least said monte cristo	281.1370
it was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised	290.9904
on the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères	64.7596
this execution <UNK> the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of <UNK> death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than <UNK>	2087.2913
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the <UNK> belt for <UNK> days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful <UNK> being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was	498.8845
cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable	410.3174
she had allowed herself to be <UNK> in generosity	545.5516
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god	326.2365
suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his <UNK> was halfpast four	487.1757
the host called the <UNK> and ordered him to saddle _le <UNK> then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse	335.0881
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner is there any <UNK> wine in your tavern asked athos	209.4194
but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked <UNK> at the newspaper i had been reading	163.1702
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	292.2781

the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to <UNK> at in his toilet	283.3415
no replied monte cristo god grant i may not have done too much already the next day they indeed left accompanied only by baptistin	235.0397
to whom	106.3854
<UNK> said albert it is monte cristo and his greek the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée	121.9916
he gained just twelve hours by this engagement he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight oclock in the evening	93.9685
de villefort has secluded himself	2966.6799
benedetto yes and to the point	169.4376
but where is your master he is following me the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet who made a sign to dartagnan	74.3280
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly	561.6684
no i would rather die by thus <UNK> to his own mind the anticipated illfortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly <UNK> carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at	510.2734
in what a tone you speak cried valentine	93.5284
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so i alone am to blame for the indiscretion	67.1861
dartagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk	278.9638
yes a passage of st augustine upon which we could not agree said the gascon	170.6150
and when did you arrive here inquired she	146.3545
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two <UNK> do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented	333.4408
everything appeared as <UNK> precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire	987.7886
_au revoir_ benedetto and running into a court he disappeared	224.2754
i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty <UNK> has been hanged ah so much the better exclaimed the king	295.5592
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a lookingglass	169.4885
m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction <UNK> his	599.4584
features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	496.1407
and why not	151.3875
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse	80.7955
i shall try in the latter case alas in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france	161.0616
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger	307.6060
<UNK> your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for i will answer for it something <UNK> will happen ere tomorrow but stop do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us suggested porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people	476.2739
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south	383.7192
he repeated his question	330.2376
come tell me she had seduced and ruined my brother a priest	211.7972
who knows	76.5696
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted	341.0273
remained alone and turning his eyes on his <UNK> horace muttered <UNK> et <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> m	31455.0742
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco <UNK> the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of <UNK> and so on along the scale from <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> exposed in <UNK> of crackled earthenware of which the <UNK> are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were	2851.2368

just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the <UNK> in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated	316.4997
on his part aramis wrote a long letter	155.5178
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition	325.3542
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day	165.4763
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul	121.2846
yes sir replied the englishman	17.9266
but dartagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts	501.1835
yes noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything	149.9648
hes in the bastile that is to say he was there replied planchet	52.7456
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in <UNK> him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his <UNK> desires	295.8195
send me the keeper of the seals séguier and that man what has your eminence done with him what man asked the cardinal	88.0146
the two musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes	128.6265
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted	55.4293
in truth the lieutenants horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die	154.2734
who occupies number the little fellow who arrived last night in a postchaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish	229.1290
he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin he will consider us as brothers	139.2392
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish _genet_ and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon	391.0159
i will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire likewise	255.2967
de morcerf entered at the last stroke	71.4634
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her breathe you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her	74.8440
marie michon and what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	126.1689
dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel of m	73.2208
ah if we had been five murmured athos thinking of dartagnan and porthos	92.5203
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarins than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right	842.2178
this is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for i stand here to accuse you sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the <UNK> of the treaty <UNK>	365.5036
the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows	298.0769
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man	87.2888
in consequence he brought them the key of his <UNK> least such was the apparent motive of his visit	477.7413
i imagined it must be said morrel	113.9594
the <UNK> <UNK> in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	959.7026
de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that dartagnan had received from the duke of buckingham	74.6238
his gravity made him look older than he was well then if we can get athos all will be well	199.8766
explain my child he said explain my child he said <UNK> did you find this purse in a house in the allées de meilhan no on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor but cried morrel this purse is not yours julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning	130.5342
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital	180.8213
you want to know how we came here	65.0941
what do you want screamed milady	81.8415
you will speak in italian said he	92.3733
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand	156.9073

ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered	83.8527
the suicide chapter	8852.3398
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite ordination cried dartagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him	273.7540
kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should i do so why you said answered mademoiselle danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals m bah said cavalcanti crossing his arms one has friends the brigadier advanced to him sword in hand	192.0909

gondy bit his lips	81.9101
about five oclock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting	119.0530
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out	161.1663
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways	1061.7662
we have accomplished more difficult things than that	104.8783
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished m	93.2249
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry	73.9304
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my	142.0760
heart with one of his <UNK> rays	2018.8674
no door gave entrance to the room	247.8268
if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it	128.6870
let us rather kill them yes kill them cried dartagnan i see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening	256.7939
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window	175.5067
the queen will never <UNK> me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if i fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	240.3855
skirmishing	nan
and what will that signify to me	47.2574
dantès your health fernand rose impatiently	2520.2004
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed	248.6223
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two years do you think so said mercédès	126.2510
look at it and tell me what you think of it what a <UNK> crooked staircase said châteaurenaud with a smile	146.9114
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_ how dreadful said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo but that is a trifle	100.2678
since it enables me to justify myself to you and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	119.8393
at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	164.0358
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape	160.4436
i have told you of her attempts to <UNK> m	296.1291
yes without accident perfectly safe and sound porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal	592.7110

to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation i <UNK> famous hashish precisely	845.7400
de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline	1021.9913
do you wish to speak to us asked morrel	14.9653
so call me mercédès if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m	187.0139
davrigny	nan

seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count	47.9562
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room	30.3532

the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance	2046.1746

and follow me wherever i go to the worlds end then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god	108.2179
but dartagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers	193.3462
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps <UNK> and murmured here beneath this planetree must have been where the infants grave was dug	1065.2289

many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself	412.8025
all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended	158.9740
she thanked them both with a smile	109.6544
now in the army from the <UNK> who desire the death of the <UNK> to the soldiers who desire the death of the <UNK> all desire some ones death	732.2778

besides dartagnan passed the evening with me well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with a brow flushed with anger	120.0018
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle my dear <UNK> learned from dartagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of	117.5931
my own accord	699.9662
what will you do with the letter then asked porthos	29.0055
this man named emery was the object of popular <UNK> in the first place because he _was_ superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred	558.4693

this musketeer had just come off guard complained of having a cold and coughed from time to time <UNK>	1033.8809
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	77.9450
but dartagnan had now slipped through the window	80.2254

in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	71.7992
if i had any money said dartagnan to himself i would go away but i have none	41.1508
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance	803.5441
a gallant knight cannot decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments i am of aramiss opinion said porthos	232.7435
de saintméran oh doctor i would swear to it what i heard of his symptoms <UNK> too well with what i have seen in the other cases villefort ceased to contend he only groaned	344.2020

porthos was discontented with his condition	517.9392
but the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his selflove which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart	401.4863

for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then <UNK>	417.2506
and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes <UNK> in eluding its <UNK>	9705.2090
there is a certain fatality in it yes you are right dartagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged	142.3030
on opposing sides yes added athos i now ask you dartagnan what side you are on	201.9868
at one of the doors that by which he had entered i placed our scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again	72.1421
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here	152.5755
once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posthorses	476.6022
de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult	265.0450
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in <UNK>	153.6755
i will stop at the first <UNK> said danglars to himself	295.2083
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	171.6327
take some more of these cigars m	375.7210
yes was the reply in a low voice	49.6550
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative	146.8390
andrea cavalcanti chapter	72.0255
that gentleman is the abbé dherblay replied he	47.7794
ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay	235.1783
ah good heaven there is the <UNK> louder than ever dartagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the cellar	498.5333
there were no questions	71.9894
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding <UNK> forehead round <UNK> head and <UNK> nose like the <UNK> of a <UNK>	3593.0000
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa	104.7101
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte	74.1788
de tréville requested athos whatever might happen to be <UNK> of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his comrades	185.1300
he is moving and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see	42.3616
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord said rochefort	31.6284
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon	207.5536
what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell	182.4518
nothing was changed	108.6670
every article of <UNK> coat gloves and <UNK> from the first makers	9301.0918
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m	157.3873
now go he made a sign to cocles who went first the seamen followed him and emmanuel brought up the rear	147.9046
the tower of st jacques de la boucherie	104.9890
they killed a dozen <UNK> in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a <UNK> overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library	986.3823
no she must have conceived some <UNK> scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous the blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his mind	318.4641
noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw valentine and his eye brightened	82.7585
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and <UNK> with admirable skill	479.8538
it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay talking of captain leclere has not dantès given you a letter from him to <UNK> there one i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care of what packet are you speaking danglars why that which dantès left at portoferrajo how do you know he had a packet	248.9672
to leave at portoferrajo danglars turned very red	779.8570
no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	88.7325
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentines death	117.1864
apropos when do you aspect m	1004.7286
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house well baron what is there difficult to understand about that merely the term <UNK> else certainly is not that word known in france	320.6633
by your reckoning i must be <UNK> at least	539.9936
i hope i am not the cause hush said andrea	53.7752
i congratulate you many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me so you see in what a situation i am make your complaints known thats my advice listen rochefort let us make a compact	291.6420
he stepped forward	180.0034
a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	164.3745
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of <UNK> or	172.5460
in the mountains of atlas a marshals staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur	414.5035
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	180.8396
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends	249.1109
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared the scoundrel said aramis	63.5016
but to die	151.4676
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly i am mate of the _pharaon_ belonging to messrs	114.6367
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even <UNK> than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you	223.4110
wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	371.4636
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran <UNK> to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death <UNK> its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person	496.6996
thus m	882.7065
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances	185.1933
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	100.4601
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass dartagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour	94.0114
of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been <UNK> at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m	236.7014
yes that is my name you said then by the word of bonacieux	90.5292
thomson french via dei banchi rome give me a draft for louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it	249.7615
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a <UNK> had just quitted the port of toulon and was <UNK> all sail towards them	555.0718
but to return to our duchess <UNK> duchess de chevreuse or the duchess de longueville have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de longueville	97.8857
madame exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old	232.5000
ah said the king i was unjust here is a creature that loves me	62.3591
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the <UNK> the subordinate and the master	190.8746
master friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous <UNK>	337.1345
i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought dartagnan	106.7692
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champsélysées	150.6189
no his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite	372.0232
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captains feet	271.9449
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation	803.8514
at ten oclock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten dartagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last but that was not all they must get to london	132.5371
besides i care not for his displeasure still situated as we are yes do you know how we are situated	186.7326
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice	69.2322
dartagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	148.6511
aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly	131.5158
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked albert lighting his cigar	82.8015
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not <UNK> out of it but <UNK> like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings that is to say <UNK> of	369.0991
their clothes and fragments of their cloaks	163.8138
look he said	24.5234
he held out his hand	20.6189
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville i did go there well she was no longer there but she had left her new address where was she guess i give you a thousand chances how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight	134.1303
then i saw no more but i heard the noise of breaking furniture	80.0078
love me then haydée who knows	79.9264
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	306.9128
i am nearly thirtyseven mind <UNK> smiled as he <UNK> we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future how formerly i was your <UNK> by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old indeed then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a	330.3571
good <UNK>	6402998784.0000
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers	182.3079
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool	108.5689
what do you fear that we may be discovered the door is locked they may tell us to open it they may if they like but we will not you are a perfect <UNK> eugénie and the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require	167.8519
the abbés chamber chapter	332.9373
i faint	192127.8750
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	94.8834
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	170.8013
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most <UNK> cabbage for instance	3760.0239
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was <UNK> been burnt no doubt by some <UNK> read this treasure which may amount to two	269.9205
have you gone mad my dear friend what is the matter returned dartagnan we are saved i dont see that at all answered porthos	50.2527
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the <UNK>	240.0750
have i any need to tell you so	41.0381
well laporte asked the queen	84.8016
de villefort	4.0417
de châteaurenaud did they speak of me not a word so much the worse why so	95.9838
now dherblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached dartagnan	203.7332
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of <UNK> water i left half because it seemed so bitter noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak	96.9788
i have been here since the morning	44.5213
that is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife but i have not told you that i know him cried bonacieux in despair	101.4057
m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator	132.8349
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten	112.0636
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked <UNK> of the brow and by a deeper sadness	608.5673
on the ground floor diningroom two drawingrooms billiardroom staircase in the hall and a little back staircase windows magnificent windows so beautiful so large that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame why the devil have they any stairs with such windows luxury has everything but shutters yes but they are never used	589.1339
dartagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was	225.6538
in a closet attached to the queens apartment	149.3753
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer distance	1263.2557
no fifteen thousand are not enoughi cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs no replied andrea dryly no i cannot i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly i said without your laying out a sou do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good <UNK> yours with <UNK> both of us	338.9068
to be dragged down there again it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you <UNK> creature who would be glad never to see them again andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	275.5990
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their <UNK>	746.9012
i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis	81.4599
i will make you another offer what is that i do not offer you a million because i have it not but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercédès at the catalans and give her two lines from me m if i took them and were	68.1992
detected i should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred well said dantès mark this if you refuse at least to tell mercédès i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out	120.6289
your brains with this stool threats cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad	355.9028
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy	117.3873
you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the	229.2294
culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his <UNK> they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die	309.9296
you hear madame yes sire i hear stammered the queen	172.1172
it is impossible that your majesty can make all this <UNK> about a letter written to my brother the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête	120.1624
de villefort relieved all dantès apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort	154.2666
a folded paper fell from edwards breast	1839.0554
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure	121.0000
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another <UNK> live the emperor said the figure	707.8738
the young man was overwhelmed as he read	44.3517
in one second athos joined him	469.2248
this is not my weakness i tell you at once family joys have no charm for me	227.1667
of course we do replied albert	103.9374
no one could be seen or heard	47.1108
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the ministers cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped	106.3210
whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled <UNK> and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling	200.5855
his <UNK> ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the antechamber	578.0438
madame de villefort was dead	9.8932
<UNK>	nan
what is it i have spoken to you <UNK> about danglars on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him i am glad to be reassured on that point	138.5944
our duty is fulfilled not yet said aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i cannot say before the queen chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a	94.0387
gallery on the ground floor	24.4735
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	88.3113
how did your father receive him albert	128.0101
no but my mother as a child saw her	66.9245
long swords but light purses	4315.3350
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m	55.4150
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	198.5025
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de <UNK> or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for	145.3162
my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	442.1501
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello	45.0872
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have them a horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in <UNK> style my friend ah madame said porthos haughtily do you take me for a beggar no i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a	187.3989
horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on <UNK>	381.7366
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat	160.3735
fortunately she was <UNK> and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa	1058.4734
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions	73.7338
you are madame bonacieux the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror	103.5100
his <UNK> deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the <UNK> of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure <UNK>	694.5763
who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king	104.9547
pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight no said albert the engagement is broken off well said beauchamp	252.4914
he went with groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by captain <UNK> to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat	260.7992
who goes there cried a hoarse voice	88.0925
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and dartagnan was a gentleman	201.9166
th april	257.6487
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	100.9336
in the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget that	120.9163
i have a letter to give you from the count from the count murmured the two young people	38.6345
m	nan
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme	273.4448
obey said noirtiers intelligent eye	5975.1699
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg works	29.5316
they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little <UNK> containing his letter of credit for francs	252.5804
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances well said andrea let it be as you wish	223.2515
the road to picardy	478.5417
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count it appears so sir replied monte cristo	83.6557
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	261.2184
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart	259.7064
that letter is not lost cried he	48.6347
de guémené	496848704.0000
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly	271.1387
what does this mean demanded he of the cardinal	78.1624
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	46.0318
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé dherblay of whom you have often heard me speak i remember him monsieur come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	82.2332
some gendarme he exclaimed	455.0558
are you asleep that you dont answer when i ring and dartagnan heard the door of communication opened violently	228.9145
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos i shall go and shoot on his estate	211.4980
it was not uncommon for richelieu and louis xiii	110.3396
it is my happiness my treasure my hope	192.8866
i do what i please m	221.6055
in the name of heaven my lord cried mme	20.3618
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m	166.1461
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow	848.6174
noirtier asks for a notary i suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore i shall go at once and fetch one barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted	255.7648
it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his <UNK> of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event	122.3905
of their accepting the box in question	712.2045
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor come instantly pray come madame madame cried valentine calling her stepmother and running upstairs to meet her come quick <UNK> bring your bottle of smellingsalts with you what is the matter said madame de	256.4636
villefort in a harsh and constrained tone	745.2029
m high walls not more than eight or ten feet that is not prudent said caderousse	191.1807
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly <UNK> my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	222.7608
desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire	403.9485
can i have lost it	24.4458
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him	151.7816
the morrels have been <UNK> from father to son and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at <UNK> _pardieu_ and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted	432.9798
you wish to see blois again it is but natural then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed raoul joyously	108.9249
noirtier said davrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade	101.8295
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung and on what account i rescued from the hands of mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years will you name him oh you know him well my <UNK> is count de rochefort ah really yes said	181.5845
the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned	169.0638
<UNK> fish as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris do you know that	153.9168
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on	180.0374
a <UNK> light without warmth	50268.7578

my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about <UNK> you see cried dartagnan	565.8181
i have but one portmanteau i dare say you have nothing else with you	107.0445
dartagnans plan was very simple	85.0204
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of dartagnan	34.8439
taste this cutlet my dear dartagnan tis off one of my sheep you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it said dartagnan	235.9270
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning	138.4622
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too <UNK>	1261.5316
pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me well said albert	33.1446
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and <UNK> wrath	456.2192
haul <UNK> they obeyed	161606.3906
beauchamp she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moments reflection yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly yes my mother said albert i will return and woe to the infamous wretch but first of all i must get there he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo	118.3483
might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete	74.6053
yes <UNK> can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbés gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays m so much the better for you if what you assert	253.1894
be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong	173.5481
to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise	92.7581
yes yes replied mazarin	27.3255
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church	92.4923
they stopped him at the door	19.0213
he asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the host	149.7207
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship _pharaon_ this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and portoferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to	126.6473
the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris	131.5844
oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really <UNK> said villefort	176.7474
i believed him still at brussels oh sir if you know who this man is cried dartagnan tell me who he is and whence he is	117.5645
bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great	121.6249
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur dherblay and myself to do in your service	44.9485
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not <UNK> unjust	140.7874
this is not his writing said athos	82.6340
the mind can see as well as the body	147.1329
from the count said bertuccio	79.1202
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal	916.6200
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared	496.5331
come in my host now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself	206.2622
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	333.6972
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace	77.9659
dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken	210.7578
they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their <UNK> addressed mazarin with so much <UNK> and determination	319.7709
that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of <UNK> he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned	177.0351
if m	804.8652
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to <UNK> and distract his mind	1501.1500
i will write to him then nearly in these terms let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look	256.0237
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the <UNK> then i felt that i was lost felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body	229.4985
monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared	38.1536
laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time	81.3185
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i havent seen what does not concern me but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers and he added turning to porthos heres a gentleman whos of the same opinion as myself porthos who had not	259.9443
spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	192.8062
thomson french inquired the stranger	39.6214
well what have you to say	20.6240
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject	45.9746
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera	136.5027
all three then cried alls over hush said dartagnan	4696.7144
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos	189.2517
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously	444.0319
since my misfortunes i have been subject to <UNK> which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver	288.6151
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day	84.1936
this last apartment was a sort of dark room <UNK> with papers	757.8619
ah my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal ah he was a great man will your eminence be angry if i read you a lesson i never you know you may say anything to me	76.8999
rather place faith in what i tell you	207.0789
you will tell me that i am a living being and not a <UNK> man and not a volume	138.9630
now if i die say to dartagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me	71.5007
yes sir by whom inquired cromwell	416.8442
the second operation was as successful as the first _la jeune amélie_ was in luck	167.0430
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor	762.7025
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her	203.9344
yes but it is not a horse for hard work you are mistaken i rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour and a half and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made the tour of the place st sulpice ah you begin to awaken my regret regret yes i have parted with him how why here	132.8546
is the simple fact	248.6084
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself adieu gentlemen said de comminges sleep well we will try de comminges went away dartagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted	218.3641
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i cannot fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a	115.5513
very elegant handkerchief and of fine <UNK> cambric was dear at the <UNK> a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor	1351.2231
each of them took one which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee	250.0571
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinals police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things	215.8471
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of <UNK> to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>	817.7583
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	252.7697
but how do you procure a light oh here are two <UNK> and a piece of burnt linen and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little <UNK> which was readily supplied dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as	253.0448
though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind	608.9037
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman	219.0141
<UNK> said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jewellers <UNK> is another branch of industry paralyzed have you finished said <UNK> you want anything <UNK> you have my waistcoat or my hat	834.1166
bonacieux	nan
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha	90.4661
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos	154.0313
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door	52.5732
bonacieux in her power	59.9704
he perceived in the tavern a <UNK> boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister	270.9384
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously	136.6498
for my part i wash my hands of the affair so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather	215.3104
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same	198.0983
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette madeleine was the daughter of m	415.8967
the affair at armentieres whispered dartagnan	1219.6473
then there was the ring with the lions head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand	159.3806
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me i only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark	114.2094
are you sure that no one is aware of the queens project mazarin reflected	144.3478
a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd	189.0486
what has happened all sorts of misfortunes what in the first place monsieur athos is arrested arrested athos arrested what for he was found in your lodging they took him for you and by whom was he arrested by guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight why did he not tell them his name	146.2046
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none	165.4074
i can pass that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass easily and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier dartagnan	200.1882
you may convert to and distribute this work in any <UNK> compressed marked up <UNK> or <UNK> form including any word <UNK> or <UNK> form	9283.4736
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of <UNK> slew him	887.3488
he took her for the queen said dartagnan	69.6795
and the next day bernajoux	188.9158
we are going to execute your wishes may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe	131.4594
in fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the louvre no one appeared to be aware that charles i	149.5513
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess	977.7256
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel	160.5689
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around	99.7485
does that satisfy you said athos to his adversary	99.5745
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you but on what day will this ball take place asked anne of austria	51.0949
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud	135.0594
scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much <UNK>	413.4524
what do you desire a bed my lord replied dartagnan	41.7893
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you	91.1207
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter	67.4301
the devil thought dartagnan	263.9746
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him	340.1221
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their	119.8876
tongues could not before a stranger	216.4568
dessessart and inform him of his promotion	137.2377
when you leave this you will behold my men at work	213.9734
and yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish	250.5553
do not forget your crosses	261.3190
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a <UNK> answered this signal	1915.3392
the young man now knew her secret her terrible <UNK> secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself	299.4262
it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer the clouds which m	268.3310
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which <UNK> and gave passage to a small greenish colored <UNK> about the size of a <UNK>	500.7760
in the evening m	41.7552
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor	568.0093

the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played	220.8356
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take i have his letters said she	235.5990
are we going to continue this pace all night asked planchet	133.3035
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the <UNK> and jealousy of some unknown enemy	355.5837
let us be the avant guard said he to porthos and find good quarters at saint germain nobody will think of us and for my part i am greatly fatigued as for me replied porthos i am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the parisians are idiots or rather we are very clever said dartagnan	181.3639
danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one <UNK> by liquor the other overwhelmed with love	396.7256
oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all	134.0651
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table	58.4796
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her contempt oh yes i know what sort of vengeance you told me that what matters it to you kitty	61.1317
no certainly not you were sent by some other person yes by the excellent abbé busoni exactly so said the delighted major	196.0181
yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a <UNK> without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way	236.1729
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out	84.2980
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a <UNK> air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it	199.9714
what were you doing at the moment you were arrested i was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m	146.6851
bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days	75.0140
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan	137.4794
be it understood we are speaking of athos	96.7802
de villefort indeed said m	65.3420
we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these <UNK> and in many of these victories	316.7945
it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me but for my security	125.5265

he saw that he was on the highest point of the <UNK> statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam	258.5178
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let	96.1937
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard	71.6333
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position	608.2401
albert besides being an elegant <UNK> young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a <UNK> recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as <UNK> in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages	984.8426
albert de morcerf commanded an income of livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris	146.1044
could you have believed such a thing possible why you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself m certainly not returned danglars	141.1269
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m	52.3326
poverty overtook you	4289.8496
he shall go thither and at his return you will send him to me	51.1136
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility	591.5827
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with it but i have neither my women nor my servants you shall have all madame	107.7363
she therefore contented herself with saying that m	126.0436
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	45.5724
pooh said porthos it is always that	25.6840
you killed that woman alas i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you	114.0532
what shall i say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battlefield that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay and of surrendering only	113.1216
to fifty men the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis <UNK> as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst dartagnan and porthos stepped backward	157.2667
i could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them	113.4928
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments	59.8515
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description	87.4645
am i not to know to whom to present it you will know when you reach london at london you may tear off the outer envelope and what are my instructions to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed	166.2751
the first who advances is a dead man cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back	199.7774
this evening m	74.8366
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in oh i was arranging a little surprise for you indeed	104.7163
at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham	129.2310
the soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon dartagnan called the sergeant	260.8605
no no i go i depart i believe in you and i would have all the merit of my devotion even if that devotion were stupidity	160.3499
let us go said athos and aramis	9.6814
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced dartagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself	274.4295
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but <UNK> is one of our friends no madame replied raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of	207.8781
being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle the young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor	226.1904
cavalcanti remained master of the field	247.5126
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	178.0481
de villefort but like the feudal barons who <UNK> against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	1574.4683
a mass of straight black hair <UNK> all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment	1307.8768
and yet as you come from <UNK> or <UNK> from tarbes said dartagnan	2795.5386
cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the <UNK> of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers	104.4172
with your belt my lord replied la ramee	60.0445
the only thing that <UNK> me is that he did not strike me dead at once	360.5823
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying	204.9618
let us leave them she said	24.2503
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	125.9756
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here	59.6880
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue	488.5163
the company looked at each other in consternation	150.7725
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand	86.7734
holloa said he what does that mean if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are <UNK> to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done crimes are <UNK> to you which had brought down far <UNK> heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal	404.9251
de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings	101.3231
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on _limpartial_ the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor	222.2067
m	nan
bonacieux saw that he hesitated	102.7120
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language	621.8155
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell	296.2642
penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain	95.4522
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	118.8316
his companions <UNK> could neither move nor cry out	2403.8313
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with	129.1787
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money	98.7123
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule	347.8362
goodevening m	24.3206
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into <UNK> the daughter by my first <UNK> renée de <UNK> edward the boy whose life you have this day saved and what is your <UNK> from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo	678.8651

they reentered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the <UNK> and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud	106.3669
dantès <UNK> his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge	701.0839
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk	230.6691
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter	94.5338
chat between brother and sister chapter li	987.8079
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked	62.7795
well said porthos i will run to the hôtel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight oclock the rendezvous the place du palaiscardinal	111.8449
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened	101.5244
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	125.1864
i not at all	149.3309
he shall not come in before i am gone said he and when i am gone you can open to him but i ought to be gone too	69.8453
dartagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	317.4639
morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black <UNK> brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	588.8449
de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyers dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess who was enormously fond of him	284.5988
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things	122.6522
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you <UNK> you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be <UNK> is a secret	139.9173
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent	10.2057
when i am insulted i do not faint i avenge myself and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room	78.6601
they are destined to produce at least ten	109.9702
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	150.0576
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	351.3943
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him	193.3804
oh do something for me the doctor flew to his patient	293.7115
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	89.2033
sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winters voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	231.9418
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the <UNK> tried his best to make it assume	370.5875
the appearance of a new coat	119.7932
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitors cross that lesser criminals were executed	137.8114
i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound again	136.2885
de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly <UNK> by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that	138.8447
his father would carry candor or rather <UNK> so far as to relate such a history	411.5580
speak speak in heavens name and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair	203.9512
i didnt understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is you think so	88.1159
but all three reflected upon the youth of dartagnan and dreaded his <UNK>	973.9004
the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the streetdoor	87.5160
i have induced you to take a charming promenade here is a delicious breakfast and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the <UNK> taking us for heroes or <UNK> classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other but the secret said dartagnan	753.4728
the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be but on my honor if he thinks so he deceives himself well listen morcerf ah beauchamp i see you know something already you will restore me to life i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you but it is at	76.8262
least a ray of light in a dark night by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain tell me satisfy my impatience well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina say on i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries	175.1035
they halted for the king to dine	78.6543
count what am i bound to do being in possession of this secret my dear friend said monte cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart	105.4655
i was taken to versailles for three months i struggled with death at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south	142.8091
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set fire to the villa sanfelice to procure a <UNK> for my betrothed an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased m well my dear albert said franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen luigi vampa i say he is a <UNK> replied albert	532.7846
and never had an existence and what may a <UNK> be inquired pastrini	1544.4482
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de <UNK>	117.5196
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hôtel	425.3938
he he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung not so foolish as all that ah muttered athos i may be mistaken i havent the <UNK> eye of dartagnan who is speaking of monsieur dartagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room	170.2039
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast	55.3280
here is what the letter contained milady be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be present	102.6657
did your excellency desire to see me inquired he	82.2271
but what astonished franz who had treated <UNK> description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself	241.9763
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals arm	224.2271
he must be apprehended do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	203.0722
m	nan
you think then that you can help me more <UNK> than your brothers said gondy	236.9776
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object	973.1953
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from	102.6481
behind the blinds of his pavilion as <UNK> observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants	575.2645
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep	487.1982
franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the audience	197.2737
let us follow him said de guiche it will be the surest plan i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne	94.1608
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france	52.7442
the pavilion at nine oclock dartagnan was at the hôtel des gardes he found planchet all ready	84.2188
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris do you hesitate asked mazarin	182.3916
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be	176.2967
the journey chapter	242.6383
theyre after me was andreas first thought	2430.4695
de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine but the accomplice shall become the avenger	161.4380
those in whom the king has <UNK> <UNK> highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the <UNK> <UNK> which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once	704.9504
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini	73.1578
a moment cried dartagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their <UNK> swords	425.2940
i dont believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin how well you reason said porthos admiringly	249.2079
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the _pharaon_ yes and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl yes now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things	124.7995
well said the count what are you doing you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do what may that be we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them do not concern yourself about that we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo i will have whatever costumes you choose	78.7528
brought to us and you can dress there after the execution cried franz	214.7651
at bottom the character of m	135.0267
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them why yes i think soin the street said athos and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise	84.1023
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man	143.8491
morrel	nan
he was masked likewise but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity	441.7405
depraved as a girl <UNK> as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his	523.7982
hair like <UNK> stood on end and <UNK> with fury he cried out silence sir she was my mother her crimes i know them not her <UNK> i know them not her vices i know them not	829.5208
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this <UNK> morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was <UNK> gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	438.9860
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil	167.4420
said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another	128.3328
planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier and dartagnan toward the rue férou	48.6125
two openings have been made in these caves the treasure is in the furthest angle in the second which treasure i bequeath and leave entire to him as my sole heir	524.6128
the sun was in its <UNK> and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor	291.5978
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded	292.4803
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard	433.7533
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly <UNK> towards him	542.5752
bah i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	251.2447
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him	118.5113
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord	233.2025
said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir say my highness is furious to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the <UNK> of the admiralty which belonged to my father and	251.5847
was promised me at his death well it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de	186.1230
chatillon and de flamarens had been there	105.7283
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action	105.0267
oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed	372.1428
you wished it to be preceded by all these titles it is quite wonderful mr president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner	213.1304
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	197.4004
de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm	148.1380
i suspect said he a tall dark man of lofty carriage who has the air of a great lord	158.4400
then replied mme	522.6660
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his aweinspiring progress m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed	276.6782
his secret asked dantès of himself	743.8669
you pity me little one said dartagnan	206.5278
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell	139.6144
felton and he addressed patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same moment	190.2923
youll see that that queer fellow will be a <UNK> before i shall be a captain come dear dartagnan look up a little courage it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the <UNK> wheels and rewards us	717.7517
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression	100.5445
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more <UNK> than our affected and studied <UNK>	504.2040
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of <UNK> of prisoners made up of thieves <UNK> and murderers	2189.3291
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love	182.4533
i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase	133.2069
then all the members looked at each other with terror	37.9042
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands	86.8982
de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which dartagnan had left him a little cavalier	37.5106
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	255.6293
planchet said dartagnan i am going out for all day perhaps	37.2470
dessessarts valet came to dartagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres	130.9351
tis here said athos	30.1380
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now oh monsieur chevalier do you love that woman still no no it is one of my friends who loves <UNK> athos this gentleman here i cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder	133.6822
to donate please visit	11240.4629
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us	143.4284
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state dartagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos	186.9876
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our <UNK> down with mazarin i will down with mazarin in french in good french my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand <UNK> in sicily because they pronounced italian badly	330.8124
mousqueton was a norman whose pacific name of <UNK> his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton	864.0548
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the <UNK> did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success	1305.4363
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville	225.1805
rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by jove dont be a coward or i shall cut off your ears	279.4367
did you know that i am at liberty i knew it from the <UNK> planchet	102.9959
the prince read as he hastened on	279.4268
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only <UNK> from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake	326.5565
there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps francs will you have your supper with us	203.4653
where was i then	71.2438
why did you not tell me so before	22.2204
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness	56.7434
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not <UNK> i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen what said the king with hauteur	263.8158
wretched men their officers wish to see you sir i have no time to see them	75.7064
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice	56.2041
swear my son the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said i swear to your majesty henry said charles call me your father father replied the child i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king good my child	101.5550
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventyfive pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the bargain	250.9719
all is ready for tomorrow evening	111.8094
and when	74.2271
oh it is <UNK> must have saved some <UNK> more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve	638.6242
the gratitude of anne of austria	55.8401
will he be at home at eight oclock this evening doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired	92.1000
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since halfpast eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices asked valentine	216.1556
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty anne hesitated	140.8649
take advantage of all and live happily and long	270.9635
the first thing that met his eye was the <UNK> drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died	141.9472
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart adieu count said the abbé dherblay i return to my convent adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach tomorrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening adieu gentlemen said the count i am going to sleep twentyfour hours i am just falling down with fatigue the three men saluted one another	131.0752
whilst exchanging a last look	801.5775
holloa there some bread he called	672.1887
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced	109.4622
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers	345.7695
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy	406.1707
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to bertuccio said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner and so closes our interview said andrea to the worthy steward i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil i will return tomorrow said bertuccio	172.8013
you are right welcome	88.1692
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the antechamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him	75.4325
no where i can confess but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul	115.9989
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket yes said dartagnan athos is right it must be burned	120.6126
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests	194.5941
i have already <UNK> sentence of death five or six times against the <UNK> of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart gracious heavens m	682.6891
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human	127.9176
noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the newcomers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character	288.5017
a true friends eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me	217.4870
hush said athos	3.9935
and remember my life depends on your answer	240.6898
dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	128.5854
yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation lord de winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct	131.3633
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	230.3955
at this precise time the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door	134.6098
there edmond dantès he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body	117.8707
of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentines room of which he doublelocked the door	184.6749
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	181.8197
good said monte cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a <UNK> soldier and you leave us said julie at a moments warning	315.6154
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	201.9897
as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the <UNK> and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the <UNK> of napoleon	388.5587
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of <UNK>	498.7195
you are certainly a <UNK> you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting do not fear i have little to prepare monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained	185.1775
a moment absorbed in deep meditation	747.5821
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley	148.7125
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said dartagnan if you persist in offering him a civility	165.5517
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him	85.3344
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place	68.0207
the duc de longueville gained the government of <UNK> five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and henrietta of england	131.2327
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now <UNK> directions are very nearly the same	1007.3939
we have promised and we will keep our promise	54.7085
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered dartagnan shaking his head <UNK>	150.8177
danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear	620.6729
giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility dantès proceeded <UNK> but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop	359.8969
unhappy father said monte cristo	18.4315
you know how much he loves me my mother	43.7178
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness	388.6408
good said dartagnan rising and brushing his knees now i have <UNK> art a frondeur and the lover of madame de longueville chapter x	220.5551
you never knew her eh madame who knows said athos	324.5743
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep yes sire said aramis yes you are right	101.3063
but for heavens sake resumed aramis	256.5056
at length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed horrible said the monk	105.2863
we are going then we two with our swords you with daggers	191.9965
in ten minutes it would strike seven	211.7163
halloo cried dartagnan has something fresh happened eh sir replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time it really must be doomed they are bad managers said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	212.4585
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil	104.7525
heres a sword and a dress said porthos	140.1989
i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us he assured me that they were two noble steeds well madame said porthos if he owed you more than five crowns your horsedealer is a thief there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurators wife seeking to excuse herself	188.5520
explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt everything because having neither arms nor password we shouldnt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms yes but before we can kill <UNK> he will be hard to kill that <UNK> will shriek out	352.2393

he swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness	454.9775
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened	173.5285

de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment	149.7715
in fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of february	107.9474
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back	69.6141

at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being <UNK> in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud	334.7821
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	177.3489

i love your devotedness said milady	168.8393
chapter	nan
noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	267.0711
that will be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari precisely	190.6566
dartagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand	63.3461
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	108.6371
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	105.1873

in the place of the palais royal dartagnan saw a sergeant who was <UNK> six or seven hundred citizens	154.4284
france is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant and who is to pursue him cried mazarin	256.5612
gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he <UNK> and desires for himself	344.4500
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty	452.3463
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m	59.1982
have you provided yourself with money	165.0862
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as <UNK>	285.9219
the plate was magnificent old and <UNK> to the family	1429.9116
there was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	400.5961
so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent <UNK> rue du helder paris the abbé opened his mouth hesitated for a moment then making an effort at selfcontrol he said and <UNK> tell me that she has disappeared disappeared said caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor has she made a fortune also inquired	418.9706
the abbé with an ironical smile	85.1024

coquenard	nan
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the <UNK> of the sloop	76.7452

you know what athos told you the other day you eat at everybodys <UNK>	656.2665
de villefort was as usual unmoved	116.7980
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected oh <UNK> sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercédès	572.8367
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an <UNK> <UNK> and of sullen appearance	692.6039

one of the officers seated at his table	59.2190
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	568.3925
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an <UNK> and flow of <UNK> rubies emeralds <UNK> and diamonds	1937.9758
he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed	64.3232
bertuccio alone turned pale whenever <UNK> name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so	369.9080
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	355.9753
this <UNK> is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in	137.0341
the simplicity of his heart	82.6202
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly let him come in then said the cardinal quickly	79.2428
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi to be his guide	224.1347
the minute hand moved on	2156.8909
dartagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	177.0128
what chance brings you here gentlemen said châteaurenaud shaking hands with each of them	150.3272
those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror	266.1933

i take charge of everything be easy it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sisterinlaw and me said athos she is my wife dartagnan <UNK> he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret	180.3046
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one <UNK> of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which i had undertaken to watch valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred yes said valentine besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m	204.4542
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling <UNK> the instant approaches which will decide everything	954.7229

i have made him a spy upon his wife the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who <UNK> the superiority of the master as great and retired	126.1112
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues <UNK> and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of <UNK> reminded him that instead of returning to	239.0792
the friends of his childhood every instant <UNK> him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	860.7687
well i call you and say to you friend felton john my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman	273.7528
he will never see you again all is over	143.5262
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	37.6716
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it the marquis of saintméran returned the count	64.5354
lord de winter tore his hair	35.9848
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her	69.1628
you said prince did you not	217.7824
go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the <UNK> which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior	532.6568

i ask you what year is it the year returned jacopo	188.9291
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river thats well said dartagnan	52.0120
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel	54.0137
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance <UNK> me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or <UNK> but this <UNK> diana continually surrounded by her <UNK> gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some	842.1789
day bring on me the fate of <UNK> and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerfs remark	523.3611
you think	126.4764
everything is clear to me now	72.0110
de morcerf the other day well monsieur franz is his friend you know what then monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate	88.4526
de saintmérans and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the <UNK> by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence	4636.6377
it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme	83.2111
dartagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity	72.9481
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servants who is seeking you the duke was not mistaken when he saw franz the servant came up to him	74.2750
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke	892.1442
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him	90.2688
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me	205.5572
the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of <UNK> portraits	205.9520
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters grave	137.1206
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop	97.7946
is it really your intention to make me captain of the _pharaon_ if i were sole owner wed shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian <UNK> ha <UNK> ha <UNK> who has a partner has a master but the thing is at least half done as you have	395.3774
one out of two votes	1711.4431
de tréville slept still worse	559.9286
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	200.6339
well said caderousse why what a lie he told he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city	69.3577
zounds he said i dont suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i dont know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv you will my lord	142.2791
duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee	271.9547
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp	76.2784
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered <UNK> between the interstices	538.3813
she fainted	1429.9506
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant	301.6286
de tréville himself	26.3850
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence	88.6178
they had seen no one	34.0868
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return	371.7883
they were in earnest conversation	237.3737
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me	1510.4454
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the <UNK> of clouds <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> lightning from lightning <UNK> no replied dantès	3422.0098
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the <UNK> office	519.6803
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten	111.0542
thanks father thanks and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocketbook which contained ten banknotes each of francs	315.9572
i believe the storm is over said he	94.1086
the carnival at rome	282.2503
the four friends followed him	23.4018
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals motive	349.0761
ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek <UNK> into our ranks welcome cried several bandits from <UNK> pampinara and <UNK> who had recognized luigi vampa	2887.5535
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	299.8317
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself	152.1775
in the meanwhile the promises of m	74.1683
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene	419.4812
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month and what did the doctor answer asked monte cristo	219.2921
adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door	85.0500
he wished to see everything	34.8043
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and delbeuf and of the coadjutor are <UNK> consulted but with regard to yours we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have	239.3630
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well	179.3191
what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at <UNK> is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble	235.0149
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same	110.9872
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses	152.6067
because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak	143.1419
what is life to younothing	6338.7056
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two well but theres his comrade true said porthos	259.1271
the letter from the executioners assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected	721.6678
the soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along	243.8638
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling	739.2451
the carriage stopped the footman sprang off the box and opened the door	46.4911
i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion and of what did he die asked caderousse in a choking voice	111.5743
de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together	60.0678
the blade was round and of flexible silver	804.1175
we must understand each other said the duke	26.8786
germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit	120.6997
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered	131.6389
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athoss aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athoss residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin	135.7946
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart	131.4593
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain	147.2230
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest	45.9884
almost all the armed <UNK> that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith	328.5161
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty	71.4261
there were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from athos porthos and dartagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them	78.1492
<UNK> his mistress and mme	191.4269
chapter li	919.6992
must you know all absolutely and rather from your lips than anothers <UNK> up all your courage then for never have you required it more albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword	319.8882
more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost money m	190.5286
on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux as athos had just left dartagnan to report at m	75.8685
upon gaining this advantage dartagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman dartagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features	153.0315
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man	71.1874
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st paul or of the place de grêve it was at the traitors cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him	212.9262
what could be the good of that	60.0351
no replied dartagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way ah you surprise me	131.7553
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris	77.4875
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	105.2605
who says this aramis is not a wit	168.7090
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties how is it all the better yes for his eminence will give you all that you <UNK> money and titles ah ah ah said porthos opening his eyes at that last word	103.9084
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to <UNK> assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall	98.2737
see him first however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to	285.0545
hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his <UNK>	305.2357
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied	299.2664
when one is eating ideas flow easily	4307.1328
i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind	234.8747
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he	44.3048
an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the _lives of the saints_ to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced	152.2100

père pamphile had seen dantès pass not ten minutes before and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the <UNK> foliage of the <UNK> and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring	259.8726
dont forget the signal jesus seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the <UNK> air	570.9532
you were walking one day behind the <UNK> when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere	182.6898
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the <UNK> i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear but you forget replied debray laughing that we are <UNK> by name and <UNK> by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free who will	519.9279
tell her the first person who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep <UNK> as well as mutes oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry <UNK> so far	277.7688
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris	263.1241
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups	904.0449
ah may you be a true prophet said dartagnan laughing	148.7313
he had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone	85.6387
its my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not	172.5246
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening	346.1823
go morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire	277.5859
in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in the massacre of st bartholomew in and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging	198.1186
<UNK> rochelle is impregnable except to famine	3131.4055
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter	89.8164
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	158.4039
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly <UNK> to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust	453.8936
i will have him come in if you really wish it athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back	119.8841
let us go to breakfast i shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry yes said porthos my air is excellent they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the <UNK> were gilt the <UNK> were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt	411.5197
she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue <UNK> and stopped at the passage du pontneuf	217.4964
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur dherblay	89.4822
but scarcely had the two rapiers <UNK> when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m	337.7364
at blois dartagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal	121.3874
then dantès departed for genoa	1603.9524
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of <UNK> your <UNK> i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your <UNK> to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued	312.5869
to gaze after in speechless astonishment	5041.3862
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a question	390.2475
dartagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist	182.5081
at halfpast three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the <UNK> of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour	149.8026
bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me mme	96.5086
de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies do you say m	158.3571

prevented from being heard by covering his head with the <UNK>	781.8568
i am happy to see m	25.0738
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him wretch exclaimed haydée her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he <UNK> of was the price of his treachery did not you know that my dear lord something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo but the	197.8005

<UNK> not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take	133.2287
her away the devil whats to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or <UNK> and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you cannot take me with you no the	146.9811
order is imperative	16719.3398
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an	145.8452
act my lord said dartagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier dherblay who <UNK> you may have <UNK> offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis	224.7057
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road	404.3176
the count does not know how should i know	37.6889
what have i done then	46.8623

my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock	125.1048
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten	190.8240
where is athos in the cellar monsieur what you scoundrel have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven no monsieur we keep him in the cellar you do not know what he is about in the cellar	94.0633

and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it	53.5746
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos	171.6008
but tell me what didnt he speak of me in any way ah yes indeed cried dartagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him yes surely he said he said resumed porthos	98.2947

i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me	59.8810
but the queen pressed the childs hand	227.2533
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present <UNK> together exalted his mind above human feeling	566.9743

the conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet	272.2625
<UNK> cried franz	75.8985
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted	379.7873
we must seize the felucca said aramis	137.6120
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by	250.5072
otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever	260.2683
he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased	316.3510
i persons whom i do not like yes indeed	211.7359
there on turning round dartagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared	84.2237
some years only	794.1406
dartagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy	102.1714
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him	75.2870
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me	95.3662
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features	110.0740
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his and these men are in france my lord i believe so tell me their names perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them one of them was called the chevalier dartagnan ah my lord if i mistake	100.3782
not the chevalier dartagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the <UNK>	141.8345
of his vessel	280.0399
then dartagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this dartagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	165.2635
tis done they both exclaimed at once	275.1225
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his <UNK> pooh pooh said the doctor with the <UNK> usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman	304.7409
danglars is his banker is he not asked châteaurenaud of debray	158.4884
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart	104.4938
the matter had been named to him by dartagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger	91.8202
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he what is your pleasure with me edmond dantès replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law	143.6672
me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray i cannot inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination m	315.7489
if the league which threatened france <UNK> all his influence would be lost	917.7720
the jailer therefore only grumbled	1714.8119
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers	187.1926
but nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the ministers secretary	263.7205
as dartagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and short	323.0433
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast	244.0622
humph thought i that looks like my <UNK> i fancy i must have <UNK> that skull somewhere or other and in fact it was that unfortunate scotchman parrys brother you know on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength	964.6318
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on earth will assist him in contriving mazarins escape if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute	462.2723
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me	177.6047
through or over coachman gallop on the coachman raised his whip	1080.4663
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	120.0449
mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of saintméran i say hers for she inherits it today	239.5691
an hour passed during which dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves	191.5684
chapter	nan
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door himself	32.6666
think often of raoul	4134.9458
certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to <UNK> into my heart	521.4193
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety	91.5653
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller	137.1138
i have been myself to the best <UNK> of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence	247.4369
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m	159.4960
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion	302.6865
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a <UNK>	150.4151
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo	45.2831
quite quite alone replied the <UNK> at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment	307.3889
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction there was a stream close by and a bridge across it	144.6556
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman but i am eager to see our young vicomte	113.2569
against <UNK> said m	32073.3887
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	163.6901
poor <UNK> to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia thats why you want to purchase my english horse said debray you think he will bear the cold better you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa you were very	276.2610
much frightened then asked beauchamp	1413.2454
in after years whether he had forgotten this <UNK> of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band	223.5806
let us break the carriage cried the people	52.5640
in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything	205.6775
he then endeavored to reenter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly <UNK> and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman	468.8947
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared	327.6052
morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what the money well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest thanks my friends thanks cried morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do	142.8556
so these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman	1533.6053
the counts serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receivergeneral held in his hand	159.0623
i think i have killed the insolent fellow	86.5000
go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet i have finished mine seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon dartagnan but he had too strong an adversary	158.0136
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more	159.4344
who i am madame	231.3976
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction	261.6324
on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse	222.4604
you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to gods <UNK> who says your supposition is not reality	1063.7142
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest <UNK> of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the <UNK> brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar	284.3983
manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction	244.0714
well then to my health although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me bah said athos god is great as say the followers of <UNK> and the future is in his hands then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next	187.8113
to him and drew near to one of the <UNK>	240.3368
except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to <UNK> them i am very ignorant of <UNK> a count of a fresh creation <UNK> in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary	340.0473
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him	178.9245
but the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies	134.0450
we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have francs left the blood mounted to the temples of debray who held a million in his pocketbook and <UNK> as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with francs under her cloak while	256.6280
the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few <UNK>	1377.4080
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving himself time to <UNK> his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack	265.2950
and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the icecold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he	317.3301
brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hidingplace the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in	534.3422
which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside	104.6715
yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite planchet was sent for and instructions were given him	449.8492
it is useless then to attempt anything with him	128.0949
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes mercédès let them fall and sighed	161.5450
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian	410.7994
from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay	54.3877
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily	129.0946
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK>	4834537472.0000
so much the worse so much the <UNK> as they say in my country reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing poverty pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a <UNK> door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited	580.4775
we can watch the skipper and if he doesnt go straight i will crush him thats all well said porthos replied dartagnan	119.3746
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the <UNK> the most conspicuous	451.0570
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count bad replied athos very bad but you received it with enthusiasm as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear dherblay	102.5039
you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange	67.0979
yes yes murmured dartagnan thats the <UNK> own residence then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all	227.6521
nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind	852.9083
ah mazarin mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction	233.8035
chapter xv	216.5030
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried milady and a threatening glance darted from her eyes	96.7092
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room	93.6055
the blow was parried	1181.9069
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and <UNK> the kid	551.4207
de tréville	2.9157
because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation another method of assassination said the general shrugging his shoulders	193.2983
i saw her this morning and bade her adieu have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired maximilian in a faltering voice	113.0054
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort	151.9967
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue	67.8494
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed <UNK> interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes	546.8160
let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes i am really he <UNK> in the austrian service was i a major timidly asked the old soldier	248.2347
is it my father no madame de villefort no me the former sign was repeated	105.8955
i understand perfectly again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial	223.3376
ah behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you	394.2298
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber	52.1027
behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of m	93.5788
<UNK> we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room	103.9466
curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of	197.8825
aramiss room	491.9273
what new <UNK> is that he says he is german my lord replied raoul but i doubt it for his accent is bad and his <UNK> defective then you speak german also asked the prince	496.4789
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it	195.7985
i am not so much at liberty as you suppose on the contrary i have a most important engagement ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might <UNK> make an excuse	177.8434
ideology chapter	447.9036
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me alas alas what a fearful extremity valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother i would rather die a hundred <UNK> yes die no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will	215.4017
not complain but hope i will think of maximilian you are my own darling child valentine i alone can save you and i will valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her <UNK> she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for <UNK> began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had	329.0132
no other covering than her long hair and that the <UNK> of her heart could be seen through the lace of her <UNK>	532.8552
davrigny no mercy sir the physician has a sacred mission on earth and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb	201.0624
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	194.4978
she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and <UNK> of morcerf	227.5942
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person	261.9337
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade	38.6559
there is but little reason why i should delay you	107.0495
the journey chapter xxi	169.4382
oh what a detestable crew they are these <UNK> speculators madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month	201.9158
in my service the very best coachman in paris	245.4265
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than <UNK>	781.0996
oh it was cruel to us <UNK> i say <UNK> you also listen my friends said the <UNK> may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven <UNK> discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know	589.8000
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient <UNK>	183.6151
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to dartagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served	130.5740
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those <UNK> remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	965.3464
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged the king was invited to come and see the hanging	150.9381
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left dartagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything	85.9755
milady faltered dartagnan and fainted a second time	308.2267
shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious <UNK>	1314.8446
as to the sailors of the _pharaon_ they must have found snug <UNK> elsewhere for they also had disappeared	393.1997
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are	85.4201
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting	128.1801
in fact we must not <UNK> that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark <UNK> gave him serious uneasiness	337.0865
the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind	190.8368
i will denounce you before men as i have denounced you before god and if it be necessary that like <UNK> i should sign my accusation with my blood i will sign it ah said my enemy in a jeering tone thats quite another thing	204.5910
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were <UNK> made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he	295.7620
looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all	89.1449
the man made no reply	43.0149
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose <UNK> air and austere bearing pleased him much	703.0728
bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air	447.7618
come with me then	26.7774
yes said athos magnificent	290.8144
in brief i regained your harness and then mine	945.1698
this frequently happened	2728.6206
another possessed all mercédès heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead	730.1840
la <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> the devil said athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other i will go to the second after attending the first said dartagnan	387.6643
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	208.3462
m ah yes i see said the count in a voice hoarse from emotion	81.3302
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful	389.4894
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade	51.9464
no but we are going to replied dartagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground	63.8228
what does he want with me said monte cristo	18.3103
my affianced husband returned	2975.9192
dartagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time	110.6005
there is no hurry you know	42.3727
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with <UNK> notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m	341.6043
danglars what rival _ma foi_ what rival	1390.7811
not the least in the world replied bonacieux	57.6013
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word	188.7330
besides to tell truth whilst dartagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to <UNK> with athos <UNK> open athos	1009.9074
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino	291.9352
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours	100.1673
albert extended his hand	26.0496
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peters by daylight	194.7778
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue <UNK> as if he was waiting for some one	224.0078
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	184.5466
bonacieux shrugging her shoulders	142.4108
tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anteroom	115.1118
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful	231.3535
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the <UNK> principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being <UNK> not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my	332.9046
dungeon	nan
see i have sold my watch for francs and the guard and seals for	237.8620
has anyone brought a letter for me asked dartagnan eagerly	107.7404
you meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics	3103.1902
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels	151.1608
de villefort who had been the kings attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles monte cristo glanced at bertuccio who became <UNK> than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling	164.5197
like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was <UNK> with glass but it was locked maximilian was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room because a red curtain was drawn before the glass	192.2866
dartagnan believed this cough to be a signal	293.0690
no my guardian replied raoul blushing	218.1129
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as <UNK> as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for _terra firma_ and which <UNK> and <UNK> as we draw near to them	647.8539
at seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled	158.5628
but he will make it up in you i am sure	52.7180
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	181.4353
there <UNK> in that <UNK> brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material <UNK> sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with <UNK>	6671.0430
<UNK> cried dartagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken	50.2643
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse	1989.7971
so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you	204.1583
oliver cromwell mr mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at <UNK> and promise me to set out tomorrow morning i promise my lord replied mordaunt but	157.9706
how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave mordaunt bowed	96.9782

lord de winter on quitting dartagnan gave him his sisters address	155.5099
but dartagnan remained <UNK>	19157.1738
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded	69.4812
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a <UNK> for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	202.0106
he opened it and read as follows dear m	212.6121

the two musketeers were already there and were playing together	91.2867
a great favor zounds monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin no matter said dartagnan in his most wheedling tone	133.5246
it appears that he had met with <UNK> likewise on his journey	313.7809
free to leave me leave you	70.8683
de morcerf as you saw and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together	116.2405
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him	284.1263
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find dartagnan	111.7563
de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously m	156.0626
debray is one of your friends m for shame exclaimed the baroness	74.8393
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside	151.0598
the breakfast chapter	396.7551
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthoss long cloak and dartagnan rushed straight into the middle of it	87.4255
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait	358.2972

there was a great deal going on that morning and many <UNK> persons at the palais <UNK> persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	449.3163
<UNK> i wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time	153.3986

four marble steps led down to the waters edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide	357.0072
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there monte cristo made a sign with his head to	73.9181
show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded	189.7587
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me oh oh said dartagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso	159.5262

now he was accustomed to walk with his <UNK> piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind	431.1316
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly	64.9890
take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness m oh sir said caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which <UNK> his <UNK> sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of	164.1892
a man i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings	198.4288
dartagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme	143.4821
i have that honor your excellency you had a new livery yesterday yes sir i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow	110.2934
we shall both get into trouble	341.5108
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	17.2830
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage	51.4708
ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the <UNK> are <UNK> by observation danglars was quite annoyed by the young mans indifference	594.1230
oh father do not look in that way at me oh i am guilty then you will not pardon me the monk recovered his usual expression	79.0912
it is well said he kissing it it is my masters ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it	133.4002
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity	360.9082
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me so much the betterso much the better said caderousse	168.3869
miladys supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers <UNK> which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere puritan	299.7771
de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawingroom in half an hour as he expected the notary and m	56.3496

my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two papers _la <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> within six steps of her for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m	667.2054
i was mistaken said the host hes not quite dumb	137.3030
de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously	124.9450
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la <UNK> by the <UNK>	442.5560
we hope so answered the curates	439.3975
dartagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army	83.9064
speak speak take this letter said dartagnan	69.5158
the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities but once again that <UNK> is he	315.2417
no monsieur jester replied dartagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god amen said dartagnan getting into his saddle	110.8491
sit down there before me dartagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standing and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed	87.1493
whats your business here you hussy dartagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak	281.6195
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saintméran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy	96.4432
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church my dear bazin you ought to perceive said dartagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly	171.9714
changed in everything	345.5295
eh he said to the postilion eh <UNK> <UNK> this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian <UNK> with cavalcanti	2012.1235
the valet de chambre announced m	78.4678
de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my fathers demeanor madame said albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years	357.2751
arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road	162.8667
onward cried dartagnan in a loud voice	30.1480
my safety is now a mere question of speed at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg <UNK>	139.8633
i have the price and dartagnan threw the bag upon the table	72.1477
lover and husband chapter xix	150.3817
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a plot	140.6016
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone athos smiled	449.3896
he had a deepset penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray <UNK> and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast	484.4092
if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left	415.0955
you need not awaken the coachman ali will drive in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door	82.5328
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution	1114.7777
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who <UNK> great importance to you as i have heard him say but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed and how much did she give you for	175.2101
this fine enterprise a hundred louis well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something	185.4190
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	210.2600
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with <UNK> by mme	1682.5973
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis	166.9193
oh m	299.9435
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me m mercédès burst into tears her womans heart was breaking under its load of memories	162.8850
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of dartagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself	139.7414
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to	113.6596
be <UNK> pretty good when i havent eaten for twentyfour hours muttered danglars	1457.8159
noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man	352.2651
sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise	44.7120
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house	659.6361
tis he past all doubt what do you say nothing nothing	107.9611

fortunately the <UNK> were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without <UNK> had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the <UNK> to see in the dark and the pilot who <UNK> did not evince the slightest hesitation	441.1296
<UNK> one too he exclaimed	366.3305
answer i command thee said the duke	112.8481
he was a strongminded upright young man	224.0930
mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement	165.8205
haydée scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of <UNK> too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural	283.7553
a mantlepiece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an <UNK> on each <UNK> representing homer carrying his guide the other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> paper red and black <UNK> was the appearance of lord wilmores drawingroom	5953.5894
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	182.8683
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know dartagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul	169.9486
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his	305.9885
disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly <UNK> gentleman	208.2076
i confess it replied albert	91.2714
the corvette must now i think be on her way to <UNK> must she not m certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles and the yacht was ordered to remain at <UNK> tis well	643.2026
the little house was surrounded by a low <UNK> hedge two or three feet high	308.6756
ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment	103.0257
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish	139.7317
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared	102.2522
who was it you were talking with over there she asked	232.3116
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him	174.7393
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us	208.5821
here he said here is a draft at sight and here is your fowl danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost	257.2013
that means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which i trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble <UNK> in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in	370.7655
twelve months and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance	204.1980
mercédès although <UNK> from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the	599.8156
table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed	604.4104
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of <UNK> your majesty on your side said dartagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been you are in error sir answered the queen	154.8221
justice before everything then turning toward m	267.3011
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she i am sure of it nevertheless i confess i still doubt but the _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence athos she is your wife i tell you repeated dartagnan only reflect how	99.2427
much the two descriptions resemble each other yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually it was dartagnan who now shook his head in his turn	169.8016

my brotherinlaw and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain	184.5332
and what else does your worship wish for to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom the viscount de bragelonne	81.8669
monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	58.3706
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion	333.5311
i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de <UNK> appearance	147.7188
the door opened two guards received bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him	112.1696
the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the <UNK> of the projected alliance m	232.9431
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman	100.6185
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuses and wrote the following letter to dartagnan dear <UNK> am about to set off with aramis on important business	218.9275
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground	347.6505
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures	98.6769
yes monseigneur replied the officer	33.3383
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	85.5647
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitors cross the carriage was taking the direct road to it	249.7378
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother	114.5949
morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair	90.8680
he arrived valentine was expecting him	391.5728
dartagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army	174.8335
but is this all that is known they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him on his track said villefort	112.1602
the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers	93.8833
m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	336.6763
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on	103.4210
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head	41.7389
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a	108.5547
chance to speak to beppo and who is beppo oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his <UNK> castle indeed you are a provident person i see why you see no one knows what may happen	183.1504
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to be	77.2806
take it and there ends the matter what cried athos are you selling my <UNK> <UNK>	1730.7437
coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk	135.9913
i am the bearer of a letter that is all	35.6506
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation	54.0422
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall	54.3025
by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering <UNK> and carbines of four gendarmes	2133.8137
in half an hour the young man bowed	28.0179
my dear mistress turquaine said the gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly if you happen to have any <UNK> make them pay you or any creditors dont pay them why <UNK> asked madeleine	522.4544
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars	148.9923
the abbé busoni said la carconte	77.6156
he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert	171.3909
lucien debray ah indeed said danglars and where was that at the house of m	77.3575

he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty	373.2576
morrel you are going to destroy yourself indeed count said morrel shuddering what has put this into your head i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the	87.3406
latter in his hands	60.7009
they resumed their route	143.3434
i am monsieur du <UNK> an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincennes mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that dartagnan and porthos should give place	141.4468
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment	80.0852
i will prevent you m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings who am i repeated monte cristo	346.0085
as this was the height of dartagnans worldly <UNK> be it well understood from his desire of finding mme	881.2897

de tréville began to disquiet the devil what must i do above all things be always on your guard	126.9939
dartagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet	258.9820
i will send you to constantinople no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of <UNK> ali the sultan send me the <UNK> and make my secretaries strangle me you say very true responded debray	711.1684
ah my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us	64.4638
in the morning it was <UNK> that prince de condé had evacuated bethune and fallen back on <UNK> leaving however a strong garrison in the former city	796.5344
mademoiselle de villefort my <UNK> said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand	68.7049
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph this work is provided to you <UNK> with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of <UNK> or fitness for any purpose	502.8803
it was only a way of speaking	51.1420
when m	278.6804
for a moment dartagnan thought that parrys brother had disappeared but he was mistaken	86.6298
nineteen returned dantès	1748.8553
the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators	370.6799
why didnt they search more <UNK>	20399.3965
mazarin did not even turn around	115.5863
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively	505.3355
how pale you are no but i have just met with a terrible adventure are you alone athos _parbleu_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and dartagnan rushed into athoss chamber	94.6848
i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you i burnt it for fear that even a fragment should remain for that letter must have led to your condemnation and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier yes i can easily comprehend that	124.9439
they are the count of châteaurenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table m	221.8418
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of <UNK>	469.9915
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos	1092.2412
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	96.2873
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man <UNK> in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at portovecchio and tunis	256.3177
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt	101.1432
from two oclock till five franz and albert followed in the _fête_ exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	393.3103
alas he said i am then to die	26.8024
but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate	141.7651
you have brought me something yes if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief here it is said aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it is	151.8696
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed	42.1542
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured dartagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence	135.5062
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	115.5260
their agony formed part of their <UNK> they were not seen alive they were despised when dead yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes	188.7090
but had the good sense not to say anything	199.6204
pardon me my friend we will see about that presently said dartagnan with a slight smile	45.1369
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand	43.5249
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but <UNK> his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the <UNK> of his auditors	652.3995
franz waited impatiently inhaling the <UNK> of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air	631.7815
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon	145.1232
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his <UNK>	257.7664
emmanuel of this gentlemans visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon then turning to monte <UNK> hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a <UNK> alley	235.6552
therefore athos had invented the phrase <UNK> <UNK>	50865.7734
at auteuil near paris m	589.4467
well since there is another <UNK> and younger why you may take the old one and let us drink what asked the host quite cheerful again	417.4546
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent <UNK>	439.6330
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips	153.2226
he replied in <UNK> and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another	621.6370
caderousse drew a deep breath	338.7239
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness	626.8353
de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto	247.6204
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams	504.9754
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings dartagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos	107.4349
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber	79.9260
this must be then an affair of importance and what is the most important affair to a woman of twentyfive love	86.3468
the treasure of the spadas exists	1279.7017
i am your landlord ah ah said dartagnan half rising and bowing you are my landlord yes monsieur yes	132.1883
i am the friend of the great cardinal of the great cardinal perhaps you would contest his right to that title madame i would contest nothing but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister	125.5577
he never spoke of women	246.2254
he <UNK> replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it	175.8707
and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	197.9640
ah how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying	151.5826
oh tis a noble <UNK> athos yes true as gospel said dartagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities i remember well said planchet he was fond of <UNK> truth he drank but not as other men drink	616.0375
it was about halfpast nine	72.0190
the tiger whose nature <UNK> him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary <UNK> the idea of <UNK> is not alone that the	699.2613
laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological <UNK> dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart	420.9457
eh he said negligently this money is not mine	146.4005
what is it that we really <UNK> which we cannot obtain	401.7895
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this <UNK> gesture turned towards	246.2905
monte cristo and <UNK> my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner	252.2727
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to <UNK> for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity	269.1302
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage	36.9899
she bore me rapidly away	1386.4177
then dartagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting	95.4621
his face a little <UNK> had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	936.6566
what refreshment can i offer	901.9927
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressingroom would be able to defend his property himself	161.7350
porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to parrys brother he was not nearly so strong as himself	191.6140
soon the water rushes out of the <UNK> like a <UNK> spouting the vessel gives a last groan <UNK> round and round and disappears forming a vast <UNK> in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea	537.0050
the ballet was called <UNK>	8874.3594
sometimes on a sunday i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my <UNK> in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which i am really in want of but nothing happens	207.5999
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event	227.5688
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman	211.9975
you might have taken lord <UNK> tis said was your <UNK> but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our <UNK> preferred taking them mordaunts very lips grew white with rage	1242.3768
the <UNK> of _moccoletti_ entered on the scene	4687.3486
attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said dartagnan for myself i will <UNK> the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard	293.2362
but resumed la ramee that is only a way of corresponding and that is a great deal it seems to me but not enough pardon me for instance i say to my friends be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses well what then la ramee began to be uneasy unless the	79.3833
horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you thats not needed	282.6297
i am lost said he	25.8108
you cursed host a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird you was right said the swiss <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> with <UNK> there said the dragoon	1664.3344
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor	338.8969
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension	150.4622
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme	57.5758
it was fortyeight hours since i had taken any nourishment	160.5441
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos	275.4809
i really must pray you to excuse me <UNK> <UNK> was not attending to the conversation marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on ones wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion	641.1066
of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m	483.9073
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others <UNK> them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like	320.5081
myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults	424.2331
he would have <UNK> at this instant someone knocked at the door	277.9031
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated	29110.8926
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is <UNK> is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards	126.6260
you with all the deference due to your rank	309.9395
i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her	63.5660
you are young	43.5206
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere	188.6036
well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends yes certainly added athos and the other two	130.2709
what are you doing said he	10.5303
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the <UNK> and the <UNK> seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments	785.4475
in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old <UNK> formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to	419.0443
resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to <UNK> his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	609.9767
in the rue de seine he met planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a <UNK> of the most appetizing appearance	284.8055
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud dartagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar	487.8082
ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities	468.9135
de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the <UNK> his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to no in the avenue des champsélysées	451.9125
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says <UNK> <UNK> gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of <UNK> shrubs <UNK> fruit and <UNK> virgins	4359.6997
between six and seven oclock the road of chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of <UNK> but suppose we all go said dartagnan what the devil they wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos	257.5712
m i have the honor i presume of addressing m	102.4437
when i first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances	186.2710
dartagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or <UNK> as if he had never seen them before	152.5273
mousqueton sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth	74.0276
when i ring once it is for my valet twice for my majordomo thrice for my <UNK> i do not waste a minute or a word	335.2083
the <UNK> became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers	440.3016
the sultans and <UNK> who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really <UNK> and <UNK> who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours	702.0828
of idleness and _ennui_ by no means madame the fanciful exists no longer in the east	646.7866
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate	306.1198
is he handsome she asked	215.0646
he shouted again	3412.0286
stay look at m	101.9731
de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment	103.0036
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	42.4551
we even <UNK> very <UNK> if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest	1169.4777
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you ah yes	70.8550
returned the count i know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon	98.1671
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or <UNK> is not your fault	234.5243
m yes you cried franz whose hair stood on end you m	218.6955
what is this asked the captain	18.5848
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family	122.5105
the bearer of this letter will tell you madame what i dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of <UNK>	249.8970
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel	195.2357
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence	541.4258
the galleyslaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other	294.7184
this is a boy tréville a mere boy do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux truly without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to	202.2297
your majesty why he is a very devil this béarnais <UNK> monsieur de tréville as the king my father would have said	196.3418
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something	78.0870
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily	388.4868
dartagnan held the bridle of athoss horse and porthos that of aramis	43.7514
very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he doesnt wish to speak	122.6713
then he saw through the whole thing	72.5423
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	122.9125

aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours a cousin of his named marie michon ah i knew her cried the duchess	371.6312

this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was <UNK> <UNK> he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of <UNK> and from the other showed lips drawn down in <UNK> illtemper	841.9846
the sergeant of this company a <UNK> of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville	303.7694
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill	211.4873

she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband	43.1193

not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was	103.8811
accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba	107.1875
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait dartagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended	731.9901
but by what means	134.5408
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful is it still only an intention your eminence asked dartagnan	101.8622

bonacieux <UNK>	4706081280.0000
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy	53.8613
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	252.4950
dartagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends	190.2485
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed aloud	63.2098
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	548.4816

well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer <UNK> from your princes and your <UNK> servants all of them <UNK> who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to	562.5113
master them one of these days	140.5922
now let us go m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement	85.1183
i held back his arm	229.3310
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni	180.4386
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the <UNK> which presented themselves to her mind	329.5739
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they	209.0482
let us see said the queen what the count says and she opened the letter and read <UNK> unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you	101.6661
that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory cannot fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe	113.4314
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated they continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service	178.8323
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes	306.7348
he entered after having twisted his mustache and <UNK> his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions	936.0912
morrel replied villefort	131.9898
he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet	73.3901
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father i will live morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment	84.9376
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne	1168.7056
danglars do you not maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them	309.8784
de villefort no madame no it was your granddaughter then was it not yes a groan from barrois accompanied by a <UNK> which seemed to crack the very <UNK> attracted the attention of m	394.9276
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will	96.0674
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps i should not hesitate	273.5612
and here is mr mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging glances	268.8126
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais dartagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed <UNK> in their conversation	153.0158
m ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of <UNK> and the <UNK> whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed	179.4952
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of <UNK>	600.7303
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet	127.5096
and arms at one of its corners	538.6392
i am even sorry that this evening i almost <UNK> there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see the two friends saluted the duke	128.1469
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous <UNK>	139.3842
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	135.8654
having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dantès proceeded to make his final <UNK> on board _la jeune amélie_ distributing so liberal a <UNK> among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him	571.0522
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saintméran arose from her pillow	79.1220
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left	103.2268
the shore and was making for the opposite bank	288.5218
he had always something or other to do	233.8757
and the queen what queen madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv she is at the louvre as you know yes and i hear in bitter poverty	179.6904
as dartagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m	348.4031
but mazarin is a lowborn rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an <UNK>	579.5767
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his <UNK> anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three <UNK> anyone had said to either of us then <UNK> day will come when you will be happy and will bless <UNK> matter whose voice had spoken	445.0788
we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of <UNK> yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing youhow often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine look at me said monte cristo with that	171.7736
expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and <UNK> at me	965.5582
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow	198.9523
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the	90.6424
women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oclock this	184.1974
evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and dont you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the _barberi_ who gained	128.4161
the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell	276.2319
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act	403.9570
but hold out your glass	411.4418
gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted	240.2519
you called me didnt you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table	139.7304
speak said athos	11.4497
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of roman <UNK> francs	338.4381
in about ten minutes dartagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos	71.9492
close to the hedge the steps stopped	149.8499
dartagnan will give each of us his instructions	127.5784
the bird on the branch the dog in his <UNK> the sheep in the field the boats <UNK> in the loire even became alive and <UNK>	2065.6067
he consented	25920.1270
it is something to be well received	49.8464
then dartagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful	296.2527
he did not even give himself the trouble to <UNK> and displayed it with affectation before the queen	285.8976
i hate the <UNK> are coarse like every nation that <UNK> beer would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort	406.1382
<UNK> for heavens sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the <UNK> of natural conditions	353.4830
chapter	nan
he was hungry he supped he went to bed	130.6295
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart	120.1350
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i dont believe in them the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of <UNK> appeared to <UNK> and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos at all events man	317.8089
or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair <UNK> affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained how is that cried porthos and aramis in a breath	458.4540
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	58.2248
pardon pardon cried felton oh pardon milady read in his eyes <UNK> <UNK> pardon for what asked she	1487.3118
the host opened	133.8926
dartagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away	156.1263
the opportunity was good	455.5953
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter	153.3292
yes said he	6.7947
chapter	nan
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter yes where is this letter cried dartagnan	63.7479
<UNK> while reading this letter dartagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers	671.7695
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	73.7244
if there are two let parry kill one and you the other	302.2705
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said davrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair	163.0746
if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison	138.0355
when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses	107.5119
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out it would be very easy if you much wished it how so probably you have some correspondent in greece i should think so at yanina everywhere well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini	179.8878
you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today do so i will m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you you will oblige me danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his _coupé_	112.1061
now said the count let us follow him franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley	61.4984
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	757.3937
the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number	326.9814
dividing the proceeds chapter	259.3260
monsieur said m	78.0160
think of it madame he said if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands she listened panting overwhelmed crushed her eye alone lived and glared horribly	208.8049
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france ah that is different the house you purchase is at auteuil at these words bertuccio turned pale	110.8825
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousses glass and do not interfere with us yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his <UNK> but the <UNK> means said fernand	620.4543
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we cant fail to be beaten we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos	175.6932
i left five hundred with assunta my sisterinlaw and with the other five hundred i set off for nîmes	260.9608
no but by <UNK> the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks where can i sleep on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you <UNK> can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our	294.2832
oars as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition	224.8466
mousqueton cried dartagnan let us be off let us set off mousqueton recognizing the voice of his masters friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself <UNK> during the night	244.2408
you have no right to put me to death alone	69.8742
chapter xlix	159.6606
his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the <UNK> <UNK> and he tottered like a drunken man	616.5559
tomorrow you shall be free i had but one wish that was that he should kill me	71.8119
he saw but one means of restoring <UNK> and clearness to his judgment	1309.9572
in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress	130.3185
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des fossoyeurs near the luxembourg	63.6048
as long as the procurators wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself	74.5598
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly not well then and so he is in paris yes and what effect does he produce why said albert he was talked about for a week	230.3855
then the <UNK> of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle <UNK> diamonds and so people talked of something else my good fellow said châteaurenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	352.3246
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a <UNK> and began <UNK> blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking <UNK> at the cerberus drew the letter	504.1254
from his pocket and presented it to aramis	49.1089
for one <UNK> my <UNK> day if you do so they will <UNK> you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as i die	564.9656
i dont ask porthos his opinion has been given why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token dartagnan may sell it my dear aramis you speak like theology personified	316.5316
dépinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m	123.2018
he also morrel like you considered himself the <UNK> of men well asked morrel	1405.8398
m maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you to seek me repeated morrel as if awakening from a dream	145.5417
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents life is a <UNK> of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile	1115.8914
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two	87.1232
but were you not on horseback	102.3604
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity	167.7131
these important advantages dartagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe	183.8145
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence	155.6288
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud <UNK> you	1664.2891
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then then asked caderousse shuddering	193.3267
well i must confess it does replied dartagnan	87.2050
everything was in <UNK> dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys	712.3376
he fell back cursing with rage	639.1696
give up broussel she cried fine counsel indeed	1267.2885
the tower of st jacques de la boucherie	104.9890
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound and grimaud threw the dagger on the table	140.6587
i have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching <UNK>	1279.4680
devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing i havent seen you with so cheerful a face these five years the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of <UNK> la ramees ideas grimaud entered and made a sign	172.7367
to la ramee that he had something to say to him	27.3870
it is m	66.1758
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall	97.4304
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame <UNK> edmond hate reproach the man that has spared my sons life for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m	853.5706
a nice acquaintance my friend porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is <UNK> to you among the women gentlemen gentlemen cried dartagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious	133.3789
can i trust in you oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking it	63.2573
if my mother could know of this attention on your <UNK> i will venture to tell heri am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed	132.7241
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawingroom were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort	73.3890
some of the inmates of the lions den were watching the operations of the prisoners toilet with considerable interest	234.9082
dartagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in <UNK> yonder woman here	501.4804
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown	199.2467
when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of <UNK> chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old	215.3091
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much noise	233.0489
i have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a european misfortune i attach myself to it	363.5001
you are welcome gentlemen she said	85.1530
he was thunderstruck	505.3109
what do you see a troop of how many persons twenty men what sort of men sixteen pioneers four soldiers how far distant five hundred paces good we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health dartagnan to your health repeated porthos and aramis	183.0028
now do you want a horse or will you go <UNK> <UNK> my lord i have served always in the infantry	650.3833
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return	36.9111
to what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself <UNK> and compliments we have plenty of time to spare the two friends recalled by dartagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn	241.4996
the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and <UNK> urged dantès to try and rise	287.0515
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags	384.7746
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of <UNK> want nothing you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other i hope there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you	107.1995
monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome	118.6433
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so	153.9715
porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities	337.3065
i have nothing to say that cannot be said before all juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession	351.2266
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	18.3369
the name of one of the four friends is caderousse the innkeeper shivered	193.4664
but its of no importance continued dartagnan with natural assurance its of no importance	949.4181
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner	72.1866
aramis porthos and dartagnan drew their chairs near him	145.5061
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of lechelle ten oclock struck	108.6644
one of the officers went to the place i directed	64.8814
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance	142.0098
once in service i shall be <UNK> in m	1164.3446
oliver cromwell very well monsieur mordaunt said mazarin give me this second letter and sit down the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat	44.1091
dantès repeated he edmond dantès yes monsieur villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural tone in the world	104.2054
the same expression continued	865.7433
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan	40.7919
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol	132.1274
the headsman out of the way the sentence could not be executed	153.5538
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop	28.5732
the th of february at halfpast two in the afternoon today is the th of july why it is but seventeen months only seventeen months replied dantès	165.3258
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably <UNK> and wine which is not made of <UNK> and <UNK> i think i know what you want replied athos	706.3967
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert	3124.8098
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and <UNK> was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the	219.2728
love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours	454.1711
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m	192.4933
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought	599.2315
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this <UNK> little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it	198.4807
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much information	263.9755
you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like <UNK> <UNK> on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy	776.8988
they dont have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt this time the musketeers did more than <UNK> almost cried out	288.4328
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you an agreeable one asked the italian	128.1643
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden <UNK>	244.0948
the wise <UNK> faria could not be mistaken in this one thing	684.4956
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	73.1926
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal the coadjutor started	115.4230
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might	445.2072
andrea cavalcanti	27.0803
yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word	388.5005
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with	292.7762
the faubourg sainthonoré itself one of the most important <UNK> in the city of paris	247.1513
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt	71.9749
but what is the meaning of all these questions to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid sir i can	133.1120
take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes how is that i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it what is it	101.9338
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the <UNK> rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant	773.6619
and melodious <UNK> of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	540.7331
she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been discovered	223.9785
one opposite to me the other with his back to me good	118.9123
m you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse	298.8575

de tréville was asking dartagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour	86.5299

thats all right my dear aramis take care of yourself said he i will go alone in search of athos you are a man of brass replied aramis	56.1714
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved	133.0288
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressingroom	322.0769
well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened	46.8557
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused	136.4249
at court provided you have ever the honor to go there continued m	215.4106

gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	90.1367
alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips	130.6763
it is all one to <UNK> us who do not command <UNK> expedition chatillon and flamarens looked at each other	953.0222
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested	431.4006
please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you to which of us asked all the four friends	86.9264
he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux	120.2178
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request	70.8459
did you not see that at that name the young man stopped more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business a quarrel asked athos	73.2431
my god my god said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer give me then strength to suffer the door opened gently the beautiful <UNK> pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance god of goodness wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished then only she	275.2699
pretended to hear the sound of feltons steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees	145.9466
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight	119.1304
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced <UNK> is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy	144.8138
i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave	29.9051

i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to wait let him be sent for instantly your majestys orders shall be executed but but what but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey my orders yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king well that she	96.8098

duke said flamarens you forget that tomorrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen	162.5955

in august we lost francs at the beginning of the month but on the th we made up for it and we now find that our accounts reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday when i closed them showed a capital of francs that is for each of us	197.6401
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her	87.7433
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	102.5472
he had now leisure to look to his wound	149.3093
it was porthos	88.3656
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands	70.0079
danglars left last night <UNK>	32853.5977
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so	224.4599
the you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand	407.3595
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of dartagnan they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five oclock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii	89.7919
de la trémouilles people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them	150.5007
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love <UNK> daughter of an accursed race never had morrel witnessed such an <UNK> had so terrible an eye flashed before his <UNK> had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battlefield or in the murderous nights of <UNK> shaken around him more dreadful fire	557.2656
woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison and woe to those who forgot that i was there m as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman	125.3662
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his <UNK> who will deliver me from this man	437.5761
bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper retired	119.3327
de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs	160.5755
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated <UNK> so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and <UNK> a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool <UNK> embraces	1381.9052
he still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest	131.1804
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued	42.0727
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious the monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed	187.6526
dartagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop	163.2802
in short why should i have any more to do with the affair	53.0397
has the sun done anything for me	221.5159
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything _ma foi_ you frighten me	100.8450
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on <UNK> his keeper but i am content	639.2354
once only had villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his fathers name	117.9525
these <UNK> who <UNK> in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on <UNK> all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again	524.3067
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it	172.1996
you see i am obliged to <UNK> in case your prosperity should cease	408.6819
and by whom were they recommended to you oh by the house of <UNK> one of the best in florence i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement would you not trust the cavalcanti i	165.8816
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	252.1075
she has fostered my independence by <UNK> indulging my love for liberty	2670.3391
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	393.9611
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready yes answered the englishmen and the frenchmen as with one voice	103.5458
it had been said that evening a hundred <UNK> scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his <UNK> <UNK> but one despairing effort saved him	725.4142
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans go my dear boy said old dantès and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son his wife said caderousse	84.5179
why how fast you go on father dantès she is not his wife yet as it seems to me no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond	194.3344
morrel cannot give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it how so he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months	429.4907
do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us	71.3907
let goand clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly <UNK>	6070.9497
we were speaking of hanging ah you see how it is said athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh i was sure it was <UNK> hanging of people is my nightmare yes yes replied dartagnan	216.6908
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes	136.6747
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	414.3488
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a <UNK> we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow debrays example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts	275.0587
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous ah you do not know with what i am threatened	103.8131
end of the port wine mystery	247.7716
you perceive then that he is not happy said the count	49.3998
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their	233.0439
short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	198.9644
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter	91.8656
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m	255.7979
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach	110.2342
oh at the siege of <UNK> i was in the trenches	350.5034
the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point	106.7084
anne of austria believed that louis xiii	31.4757
you wore a close <UNK> a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe and in that cap a <UNK> feather	644.0957
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii	251.1859
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter reentered it	267.2603
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame	255.9157
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries	194.5149
a gentleman and a diplomatist then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist	153.0128
when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished dressing i am going to her and villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife	81.8904
this lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs	194.3398
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or cannot be done when you are told anything cannot be done there is an end of it it is much more convenient at <UNK> anything cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly that is what all the french say returned	187.0087
signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel but said albert <UNK> a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or <UNK> like us ever do travel	648.9781
eh dartagnan he cried	36.8035
he then began to ascend the path	66.1981
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory	479.1206
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips	37.4280
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays	538.9765
the pavilion chapter xxv	479.6625
valentine the <UNK> continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water	428.1579
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate	281.0225
let us strive i beseech <UNK> us strive to be cheerful yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind	359.5950
we are judges of wounds we old soldiers athos added smiling	735.8797
i will tell them to send her to you villefort returned and davrigny met him in the passage	102.6360
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements m my <UNK> will know who my father is said the obstinate youth i will perish if i must but i <UNK> know it	308.2655
he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest enough someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de winter	187.9412
yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the count	170.6217
attention porthos cried dartagnan	128.2560
dépinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel <UNK> however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m	181.1802
my good dame asked dartagnan can you tell me what has become of one of my friends whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago a handsome young man three or fourandtwenty years old mild amiable and well made that is <UNK> in the shoulder just so	153.8346
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	93.6686
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter	162.9955
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so <UNK> will happen one day or the other m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements i should like to be there at	123.6224
the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability _incognito_ the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz	158.3183
for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice	664.9479
then he will tell it me himself i doubt it my lord why do you doubt it because the secret does not belong to him because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen and he was alone in <UNK> an enterprise like that no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you	124.7224
were wishing for just now and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united as if they had been one <UNK> if their four hearts had <UNK> in one breast you pique my curiosity dear rochefort pray tell me the whole story that is impossible but i will tell you a true story my lord pray do so	337.9231
i delight in stories cried the cardinal	856.5678
here comes m	455.2075
he recognized the place where he had <UNK> by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto	181.3162
young edward a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least <UNK> the speaker who <UNK> gentlemen edward the infant phenomenon who is quite an <UNK> in the art of killing you are jesting not at all	869.9493
monsieur she said ii do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions	134.8749
besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which _la jeune amélie_ replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come	232.1479
now the <UNK> us make <UNK> portmanteau stop said louise going to listen at madame danglars door	3965.4236
planchet had followed the road like athos he had discovered the stains of blood like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted	119.4068
renée regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover	343.8848
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person <UNK> who says that it will begin again it has returned count exclaimed morrel that is why i hastened to you well what do you wish me to do	107.0219
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twentyfive thousand	131.3632
do you expect news from him i expect himself himself	216.7964
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries well well nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a <UNK> on the pretext of his being too rich indeed that doubtless would have happened if his <UNK> had not been so favorable poor count and is he aware of the	226.2950
danger he has been in i think not then it will be but charitable to inform him	104.9722
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only two yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos	110.1724
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen	94.0299
dr <UNK> got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy	1378.0695
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner	865.9270
something better still mouston an expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into <UNK>	1759.0471
to command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her	762.5767
teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent	147.7804
dartagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	136.5914
the most important thing was not to kill him <UNK> i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred <UNK> to kill him without being <UNK> least without being arrested	335.3487
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms just so where do you come from now i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse	161.2467
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precautions sake	323.8938
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again	229.3441
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer without a thesis cried dartagnan without a thesis	167.6905
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead	142.1534
furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make mistakes	229.2426
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in <UNK> to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when	154.8275
looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with	188.9939
the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	244.4160
de tréville was about to <UNK> this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead	168.5929
they separated and dartagnan rushed between them like a dart	261.6052
i thought you might want it to show the abbé busoni well when you receive the remaining you shall give me a receipt in full	83.0848
he will <UNK> wealth he will injure the kings revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others	777.1348
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one	203.8460
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them	46.8266
let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves	292.9280
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz dépinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered	81.6934
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond studs	67.4916
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room	301.4281
when dartagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the <UNK> athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve oclock was striking	170.8895
sinbad the sailor he said	28.3318
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed	225.2625
the guard obeyed	1662.9564
what said monte cristo	22.2555
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	766.3944
he was with you just now	99.6323
in what can i have offended heri who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave	190.6143
they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally <UNK> then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person yes have	278.4722
you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune yes i will name to you several sums which will increase by <UNK> you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions yes there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation	213.2674
nevertheless she remained motionless	67.7366
i dont see why we are very comfortable in those we wear to prevent recognition said dartagnan	170.8315
why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course is that possible true as day	400.0113
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	118.4356
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as <UNK> did his <UNK> rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued	2010.5143
my dear dartagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn my faith said dartagnan with great pleasure	59.7722
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france	45.4160
but three weeks had already passed and the most <UNK> search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti	274.5665
eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away	150.1432
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive ah monsieur and i said aramis with his soft <UNK> voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage ah monsieur planchet began to weep	292.4991
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words	160.3784
i have taught you how to handle a sword you have <UNK> of iron a wrist of steel	503.5805
and you oh i dare <UNK> forbade my sending for you and as you say i am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts	567.2839
nevertheless he pressed dartagnans hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered	81.3018
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of <UNK> was deluded by the <UNK> that is a <UNK> of madness	507.8712
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what dartagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons dartagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared	265.0473
when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom	216.5069
and you sir he said	30.3361
i wish to consult you about some thing do so do you think it is time for us to enter the service but are you not still in the <UNK> dartagnan i mean active service	141.6228
alas i am from the country which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here <UNK> down our streets	590.1255
in addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the order of the holy ghost and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the order of the king was his ancestor	242.6490
thus did athos and aramis make their appearance in the antechamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting	175.0807
who goes there was asked a second time	67.0570

de morcerf a pistolshot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe and moreover it kills said beauchamp	630.6795
have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his <UNK> and the register of his voyagers	164.1078
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known	346.9988
you are sure there is nobody there said the stranger	75.3663
davrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m	233.0901
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious	175.1144
on the th a yacht will wait for you in the port of bastia it will be called the <UNK>	153.9661
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	118.6250
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what	184.7677
it meant	6602.1064
to the champsélysées said the general the count of monte cristos	47.3359
have you then power against death	507.0471
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere <UNK> the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret <UNK>	507.9449
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips	278.9105
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	256.6764

die in peace lord de winter advanced in his turn	68.1124
how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz	274.9135
dartagnan ran after her	258.5197
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for <UNK> will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	172.8764
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree heavens athos a murder cried dartagnan	164.8945
de villefort cried the king is the messengers name m	141.8967
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant	29.9167
<UNK> noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself	176.1311
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which dartagnan traveled	178.9709
i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future	224.0174
send your saddle then to the hôtel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours very well but it is already five oclock so make haste a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue férou on a very handsome _genet_	72.1259
franz gave him alberts letter	193.4820
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does	71.4965
possessed by one single <UNK> of the promise he had made and of the responsibility he had <UNK> retired last to his chamber begged the host to procure him a map of the province bent over it examined every line traced upon it perceived that there were four different roads from béthune to armentières and summoned the lackeys	387.1731
have you any money dartagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket	79.0832
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent	130.4788
de villefort entered followed by barrois	129.7250
he had borne with the public prison and with <UNK> of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry	910.2474
what brings you to paris affairs of importance which you shall know later	273.4290
dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces	207.4205
he recognized the influence of mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless	174.6628
what do you mean other men may have entered before them and waited for them we can find out said grimaud	78.1188
if she seduced your <UNK> said she seduced him did you not yes if she caused his <UNK> said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner	508.4795
the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and i have heard nothing of either of them since	88.3968
officer cried grimaud	87.7006
however those experienced in <UNK> saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> already <UNK> off and standing by the side of the pilot who was <UNK> the _pharaon_ towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was	840.7838
a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot	277.6093
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when dartagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered <UNK> were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could	231.7981
not endure	6317.3179
i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty like a sparrow in the <UNK> of an eagle	212.4355
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos	58.4774
dartagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands	258.2423
to leghorn then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind because we should run straight on to the island of rion you shall pass it by twenty fathoms take the helm and let us see what you know the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the <UNK> promptly and seeing that	189.2622
without being a firstrate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient	633.0067
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime who said it was a crime asked villefort with a last effort	341.1633
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter	128.9864
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo	256.1125
i am choking oh my heart ah my <UNK> what <UNK> i suffer like this long no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy man	270.8388
as to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous enough	77.2008
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like <UNK> <UNK> son who has not chosen the worst strawberries	3433.7461
how can a young man live upon francs a month but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it the father will never repay it	144.9807
he therefore found dartagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with him	43.5651
because after <UNK> you are not safe fifty yards from the gates on your honor is that true cried albert	279.9531
that has weakened my purse and i said aramis imagined that i had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens with whom i had made engagements which i ought to have kept	112.0571
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy	153.1119
valentine hid her head between her hands	51.2336
the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice	249.1876
at the names comte de la fere and chevalier dherblay charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene	73.4566
it must be the son of <UNK> simon who has stolen them i saw him <UNK> about here this morning	642.8261
help help he murmured oh god have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud	146.3153
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat	157.2786
the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life no no cried dantès you are <UNK> will not die and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty	270.2511
dartagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him	47.5229
then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile	37.4728
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france	120.2737
each of these <UNK> was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman	260.3880
of what country are you asked the prince	30.4196
the religion i serve the god i adore were <UNK> because i called upon that religion and that god but still i resisted	1002.9551
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder	254.3219
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a <UNK> so be it	280.9022
then replied the count and extending his hand towards a <UNK> suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten oclock	195.4269
noirtier closed his right eye	187.7449
has he built one here then no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise both the <UNK> what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you franz looked at gaetano to see	277.3375
if possible what he thought of this proposal	241.8886
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger	89.4493
as soon as possible i am at your command sir shall we return together if not unpleasant to you on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy	168.2081
general said the president we acknowledge no king louis xviii or an exemperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge louis xviii but i do as he has made me a baron and a <UNK> and i shall never forget that for	154.0327
these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you	146.7112
honor	nan
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever	324.7113
he had entered villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand	64.9534
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	314.3569
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count <UNK> a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a <UNK> one	1018.4677
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he <UNK> <UNK> proof as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend	272.9103
take this diamond it is yours what for me only cried caderousse ah sir do not jest with me this diamond was to have been shared among his friends	163.0359
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse	56.0577
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is	71.9855
a presentiment instantly told dartagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently	188.2058
at <UNK> or <UNK> one pays twentyfive <UNK> for common days and thirty or thirtyfive <UNK> a day more for <UNK> and feast days add five <UNK> a day more for <UNK> that will make forty and theres an end of it i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage then they must put horses to	1823.8660

it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants	118.3366
monte cristo seemed in despair	70.1757
crushed and impoverished by <UNK> by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very <UNK> people as the <UNK> <UNK> described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by <UNK> they began to murmur	1212.7035
thats <UNK> opinion replied porthos	14938.8584
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour	283.6449
admirable said dartagnan	18.8164
there was no time to lose	15.1056
poor dantès said caderousse	189.2958
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them	324.1249
but will you not go up pass on before me i beg of you as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	100.1032
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible i will try to accompany you said aramis though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback	55.2981
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old	245.0704
well said the latter a young woman of about twentysix or <UNK> years of age and a man of from thirtyfive to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence but the woman left last night and the man this morning it was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to	173.9758
have them pursued	1018.0224
he visited his own dungeon	465.6097
now whither do you conduct me into my room first replied comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile athos followed comminges without saying a single word	283.3625
the next morning at nine oclock he entered franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower	239.2731
orders <UNK> themselves on fête days	203470.4688
the company was then heard departing then the door of the closet in which dartagnan was was opened and mme	88.5982
first you purchase a house at <UNK> house is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	167.1358
ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep	101.8565
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also	242.1931
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair	34.6150
my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles dont speak of marseilles i beg of you maximilian that one word brings back my mother to my	275.0589
<UNK> angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period <UNK> to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven	553.8657
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of louis xviii who retreated a step and frowned	135.2851
dartagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal	41.0247
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	325.8489
these were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept	249.8909
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the <UNK> and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the <UNK> when a loud scream accompanied by the violent	493.9297
ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel	42.5533
is it against you or against myself	390.7935
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest	256.8464
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach	125.1443
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so <UNK> an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable <UNK>	706.3889
the next day kitty went to see the young man again and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening	36.3248
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or <UNK>	6283.8794

every minute she had expected that it would <UNK> and give place to another vision but the man instead of <UNK> like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered	297.4689

there is a servant active and vigilant not like that <UNK> fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church	392.5872
meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his <UNK> could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us	435.1174
now sir said the count you are <UNK> yourself ah my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen and whilst dartagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to	247.6245
strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to <UNK> his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer	371.3471
felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying voice	107.3222
have you wanted money father i want nothing now that i have you said the old man	77.3591
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate	1073.1664

no sir replied anne of austria and you may retire until the time that i mentioned to you dartagnan bowed and went out	48.6831
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwells cuirassiers	288.2668
one only is still not in our power and <UNK> us	824.7877

baron danglars one two three four five said monte cristo five <UNK> what a crœsus you are this is how i transact business said danglars	683.2753
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	56.2764
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms	141.1658
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and <UNK> on the gold embroidered cloth	252.3016
then morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen	80.0745
that can be managed i shall be baron explained porthos stepping forward	610.1451
valentine repeated the same voice	61.2653
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	658.4124
parry who accompanied him stood behind him	88.8696
listen said he i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale	104.2334
that is to say you are in love with this lady as you were with madame bonacieux said athos shrugging his shoulders contemptuously as if he pitied human weakness	104.0570
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing <UNK>	1614.3571
_ma foi_ i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m	101.9671

the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai <UNK>	199.6967
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty	244.8624

athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a <UNK> full of magnificent flowers	256.1815
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was <UNK> as a crime	428.0167
good heaven you have more experience than i have	134.5444

grasp of man	344.7207
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old <UNK> greatest protectors of commerce and sincere <UNK> to their principles	1651.8131
but the count <UNK> his cry continued to wring the bandits wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor	638.9310
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes	35.2398
do you know what gave him strength	66.1436
ah so you are not a mazarinist	67.2433
in addition to this after a half hours conversation dartagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head	189.9900
opinions held in common are a ready bond of union read again said the old man	373.1413
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber <UNK> he supposed the bedroom of athos	253.0870
what do you want with me said she	13.0953
this time he had decided to relate all that had passed	41.3559
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much <UNK>	240.3718
she has lost a tooth next to the <UNK> on the left yes the _fleurdelis_ is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of <UNK> yes but you say she is english she is called milady but she may be french	414.9382
seven oclock had just struck and m	68.4348
question then my lord where did the army cross the lys between <UNK> and <UNK> by whom is it commanded by count de <UNK> general <UNK> and the archduke of how many does it consist eighteen thousand men and thirtysix cannon and its aim is lens you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the	851.0070
other officers	1471.0669
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	113.4043
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen	47.3351
the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master	114.2320
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man	84.0848
benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family	248.5320
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted <UNK> in his hand and he had orders to blow up <UNK> guards women gold and ali tepelini <UNK> the first signal given by my father	1381.9335
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the <UNK> of the invalid	209.8947
oh cried aramis do you see count yes said athos	33.6931
they know that i am intimate with <UNK> you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian <UNK> they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you	126.0564
the scotchman	6464.3291
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	288.5629
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts	562.5164
i am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right reassure yourself madame i will answer for the kings safety as he left the queens presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	153.3153
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming <UNK> a <UNK> and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse yes it is rather <UNK> i acknowledge but it is true	392.4518
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried dartagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel	130.1090
was about to reenter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which dartagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse	185.6418
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	58.2248
the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers and how far back into the past do your recollections extend i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered	501.7373
with <UNK> to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who <UNK> to the poor <UNK> to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners and how old were you at that time i was three years	333.4511
old said haydée	574.8208
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind	2585.0020
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal then i must wait here or in the neighborhood only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here why you	83.7159
forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute thats true but is this little woman then to escape his eminence bah said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am her best friend ah thats true i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease is that	89.1901
all he will know what that means he will guess at least	90.8206
dartagnan smiled	93.3542
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund <UNK> for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided	378.8307
at my death	739.7980
oh real enough from anxiety <UNK> any rate they postponed the matter for two months	2458.0830
albert and châteaurenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first	112.3386
i speak as one who <UNK> you mademoiselle mademoiselle cried valentine mademoiselle oh selfish man he sees me in despair and pretends he cannot understand me you <UNK> understand you perfectly	934.1307
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon you are adorable madame but do not keep raoul with you why not because he is in love he he is quite a child and tis a child he loves athos became thoughtful	138.7580
he was charming	146.5943
had not government better profit by it	1704.4692
during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required repose	262.0209
but vampa raised his head proudly as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold	291.1764
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips	188.9880
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps follow me monsieur said mazarin	236.1000
i dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a scheme	212.2202
perhaps when all is considered you are right	96.6701
of all this household only two persons deserve our notice these are mademoiselle eugénie danglars and mademoiselle louise darmilly	342.4819
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> music had been succeeded by painting foils <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music	4644.1523
and drawing the three arts that complete a <UNK> education fencing <UNK> and <UNK> and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles <UNK>	10614.7666
yes indeed the marks are recent quite so replied the lieutenant	560.3565
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs	84.8056
oh those figures how well i remember them i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free	98.2472
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name	95.3810
i gratify my wishes by two <UNK> will and my money	1989.2441
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you i must try and persuade m	206.3745
whenever your majesty pleases	115.0320
that is forbidden it seems to me where forbidden asked mousqueton	189.3975
it was the king speaking on the scaffold	65.1253
dartagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuarts prison	396.2805
never that ring is defiled dartagnan sell it then sell a jewel which came from my mother i vow i should consider it a profanation pledge it then you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it	316.7595
i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics	105.7504
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarchs blood fell down insensible	86.4278
that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman	202.7591
at dessert dartagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and <UNK> about like a man perfectly at his ease	496.4356
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of <UNK> her usual beverage and a glass	301.8210
it was a movement of vengeance upon milady	56.9318
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum	1202.7074
the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the <UNK>	279.6483
the presentation chapter	693.6241
fourteen years repeated the count	38.2580
the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village	74.4219
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair	310.9392
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it	103.7367
order i am ready for everything for everything cried dartagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus	82.8313
ah if you could but help <UNK> we could both together defeat their plan but you are unable to oppose themyou whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself	583.6552
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak	117.4478
davrigny accosted the priest	655.7360
madame de villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared	113.5038
do you see that street	69.0046
cromwells house	64.6702
then said athos	35.8048
the sea continued to get calmer	1809.9469
at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_ a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the <UNK> gave him a folded paper	178.3168
she called the maid and questioned her	108.7862
and thus he proceeded <UNK> till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained	160.0788
the harlequin had <UNK> her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask	1102.7295
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited dartagnan to drink	234.0469
athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the parpaillot	329.0186
has your excellency anything to ask me said vampa with a smile	37.0821
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman	81.3607
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman	500.1057
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him	135.8413
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear dartagnan very good said dartagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to	150.5571
work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous dartagnan gave him <UNK> buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	288.0830
listen my dear my adored valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each others hearts	288.7584
the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance	400.0553
there wasnt any trouble over <UNK> when it was a question of shooting the poor duc <UNK> well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon and we must trust to the vigilance of m	305.2789
what were you doing replied she	48.6766
bonacieux recovered her senses	217.0336
debrays name is mixed up in this affair because if you do not possess the francs i reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and m	95.2579
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was	17.9545
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty	55.7878
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv gave my father <UNK> that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of <UNK> was nothing but a fable it is mere want of occupation	438.0507
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on <UNK> days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most <UNK> perfume of fine roast meat and	597.2104
to see the <UNK> in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	1387.3422
chapter xxxiii	112.9624
have you not heard that some one is coming here yes well that some one will open the doors but my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you dont propose i imagine that i shall kill that man of the church	121.0402
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be <UNK> it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter	214.6431
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce <UNK> returned with a stunning force to his memory	590.4923
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment	152.1984
oh do not kill me cried the bandit	51.7681
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage	188.1923
de saintméran madame de saintméran barrois all fall	246.4351

a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form	210.7173
suddenly dartagnan touched something warm which moved	595.3793
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling	213.9084
what could he say	38.9104
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold	66.6912
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four	74.9302
musketeers were sitting	215.0127
andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card	302.9935
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began	135.9758
call madame de <UNK> madame de villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave	149.0333
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first	45.7405
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the <UNK> held it up as if to test its transparency	422.3839
you very well know porthos that i continue to study theology for that purpose he will be one as he says cried porthos he will be one sooner or later sooner said aramis	189.7233
on entering the room noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room	115.4057
he arrived in time	142.0509
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	517.8241
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of portovecchio dont you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands true and he is going to land them added franz	156.1591
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks for forms sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day	224.1755
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects	106.3464
the time and place are but <UNK> for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious	623.3610
morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary ah because your ambassadors and your <UNK> do not tell you of <UNK> have no time	313.9185
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni it was your excellency the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me	95.1448
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england	109.4443
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison	177.8808
never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories	196.6204
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	478.3362
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten oclock struck	45.5582
here is my bed replied planchet producing a bundle of straw	185.6351
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached <UNK> which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	247.2892
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty	59.2005
chapter xlviii	311.3479
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected <UNK> witness chalais and mme	291.9055
excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocketbook or <UNK> and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his <UNK> and drew forth two orders on the treasury for francs each payable at sight to the bearer	241.3638
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one i	89.3976
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	64.2426
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door	147.2814
de villeforts pardon no said noirtier	186.1230
he cannot pardon her the history of the saraband	226.1945
cannot i serve you as a waiting maid	382.0975
de monte cristo and myself possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	198.9936
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression	146.7228
i am not a priest you are not a priest cried the executioner	25.8983
ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saintmérans death	75.8038
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep	467.0974
the boat was <UNK> to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire	357.1431
to light them on their way	359.9516
each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized and from that moment the sieur de la coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues	96.8242
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimauds hands but grimaud shook his head	148.4175
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married mme	141.5887
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution ah said athos how much time we have lost now said the king give the word and let us start will you not give it sire asked athos	105.7118
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening	61.1671
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventyfive thousand livres per annum	216.0859
he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat <UNK> to <UNK> dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed	942.4991
the marriage feast the mornings sun rose clear and resplendent touching the <UNK> waves into a network of <UNK> light	3396.6946
and the guardsman dartagnan still my young <UNK>	6644.3257
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty	125.2663
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital faubourg saintgermain said châteaurenaud	619.2661
he <UNK> was silent as it had been for the last three days	130.2997
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a <UNK> behind me was an artificial <UNK> intended to serve as a restingplace for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the <UNK> felt the coldness of the stone	432.9771
the road is never very safe during fair time oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle	229.4903
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty	532.2919
eh eh eh stammered caderousse	2262.8396
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the <UNK>	362.5747
it is he exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos it is he i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken whom do you mean asked aramis	38.8395
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you yes fair lady replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is i myself but this castle then is mine this chamber is yours i am then your prisoner nearly so but this is a frightful abuse of	173.2763
power no <UNK> words let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said	156.0502
and did you catch any of his words i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect	163.9063
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such <UNK> policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on alberts side	275.6771
de saintméran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count	23.7178
now pass your arm through this opening why you will know <UNK> it porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening	360.1657
the animal uttered a cry during the <UNK> but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless	444.9413
two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly	600.0724
bills upon his majestys private treasury answered dartagnan who reckoning upon entering into the kings service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood	456.6881
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know	247.2803
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb	305.0497
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	174.1389
ask m	103.7440
athos remained sitting	188.3005
during the daytime valentines perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m	398.0728
it was that of a man from five to <UNK> in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy <UNK> that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on	283.0815
the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries	317.2399
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives	293.8791
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	85.7305
we dispense with your saying grace grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive	752.8792
have you not happy rogue that you <UNK> you not your duchess who cannot fail to come to your aid well you see my dear dartagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world	180.2749
are you not aware that this italian <UNK> everything both indoors and out	976.0139

thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice	102.1445
de morcerf affect me	300.1053
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	216.8153
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him	369.2536
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for <UNK>	147.8733
oh work <UNK> passion my joy my <UNK> is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of davrigny	1745.7076
cruel enough if i am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from <UNK> judges	259.4770
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	224.1039
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king <UNK> my <UNK> king himself opposed it yes and france is about to pay for her kings refusal with a war	424.0025
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men i have measured them	146.5753
the island was familiar to the crew of _la jeune <UNK> was one of her regular haunts	462.9807
i dont know such a place and that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried athos	107.8645
in the meantime follow me the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did likewise	165.8130
she tried to go toward the window for air but she could only stretch forth her arms her legs failed her and she sank into an armchair	84.5643
but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes the story will be very long excellency what matter	104.3549
i will not have you left alone so long	48.6334
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair	165.2199
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation ah said dartagnan a singular commission who is this monsieur oliver cromwell inquired porthos	255.3984
m	nan
i adopt all customs speak all languages	7985.3887
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on a chair	172.9904
remember we are waiting for our turns speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such <UNK> interrupted aramis	297.0465
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew	48.3081
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection	242.2306
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her	191.2984
this evening then at nine oclock adieu till then notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared	152.6933
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man	398.8668
he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman	104.7671
_au revoir_ then that is all i have to say today	51.4978
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while <UNK> the conjugal designs of this <UNK> apparition he had just completed this <UNK> proves that in <UNK> circumstances nothing is more natural than the <UNK> the <UNK> watching at the door suddenly cried out ah see here is madame returning with monsieur dartagnan looked out and at the corner of rue	1074.3875
montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who <UNK> in his walk with a magnificent air which <UNK> reminded him of his old friend porthos	416.8533
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	124.4476
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to dartagnan and a wellknown voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening planchet cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	140.1257
as he had <UNK> would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself	285.5128
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des gardes	48.0753
in the chamber of dartagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	96.9116
well what have i learned since	77.6975
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again	104.3595
groslow whom dartagnans praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile	502.3720
m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell let us visit them all said the inspector	119.3831
yes monseigneur said dartagnan	25.1038
tomorrow replied the steward	97.2627
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos	8495.2393
thats love or i dont know what love is come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so	104.2607
you will do for me what you have done for the queen certainly dartagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out	66.6070
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me oh cried andrea leaping with joy	102.1769
her operaglass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold <UNK> the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess	255.9309
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open dartagnan could hear milady for some time <UNK> her maid	266.9592
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself <UNK> to an employment which would provide for his other wants	244.6551
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad	338.3964
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he reopened them and stood motionless with amazement	217.0639
what more do you want i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person absolutely then as i said before <UNK> well i am ready to marry m	191.9625
you were rich when i married you but little respected	265.9918
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier	166.1356
the report of <UNK> was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace	508.7414
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary	145.9785
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table	382.2694
they must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to <UNK> by a different route	134.9042
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden <UNK> of my ingots	1201.5043
a large round rock placed <UNK> on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead	585.3339
we will arrange the matter rather better	359.2000
the <UNK> arrived but m	14786.0078
this <UNK> <UNK> the accuracy of the aim	16887.9219
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity	217.9940
de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess	48.4710
am <UNK> i then to sleep on the floor asked gaston dorleans with a forced smile	934.3053
i passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and i was again in darkness	185.3683
i am lost said dartagnan to himself	35.1672
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villeforts bedroom	168.0472
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans eyes	76.7798
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you	68.2985
it is true the cardinal had been particularly illtempered	185.9192
he found him kneeling before a _priedieu_ with his head leaning on an open prayer book	267.7358
more than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own household	162.5950
for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared	120.1516
m so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your	117.2708
arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this	85.0459
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they	98.1036
returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty <UNK> now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years	259.5486
at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been <UNK> and <UNK> by you who is it it is monsieur dartagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise	536.2770
besides courage was out of the question here dartagnan had fallen into an ambush	222.6500
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be <UNK> either to calais or boulogne	558.5535
the first idea that occurred to miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant	169.0018
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope hope repeated danglars	158.3894
this is a woman of twentysix or <UNK> years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall <UNK>	828.4946
and shall we take no notice of this incident m	182.6448
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was mad	178.9008
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do	124.0670
for more than a month past the <UNK> child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey	244.4303
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes returned dartagnan	207.5479
cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry he shall receive them on returning from the <UNK> very well what next	224.2690
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	57.3798
come in my <UNK> said the king come in i am going to scold you the musketeers advanced bowing dartagnan following closely behind them	320.9297
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present	83.6150
bossuet	nan
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	50.4213
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued dartagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly	183.4556
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a <UNK> smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment	160.4772
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers	609.6989
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey	142.6109
thank you dartagnan said comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your <UNK> i may mention it to the queen raoul was about to reply when dartagnan bent down to his ear	205.0960
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards	143.4944
what do you want monsieur demanded the musketeer <UNK> a step and with a foreign accent which proved to dartagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures	146.3906
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else tis well <UNK> well replied m	354.7233
where you please returned monte cristo since i know nothing at all of it i thought the abbé busoni had told your excellency some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and i have forgotten them then i can speak without fear of <UNK> your excellency go on m	100.4482
monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story	115.1967
benedetto he muttered fatality halfpast six oclock has just struck m	634.2629
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and <UNK> the <UNK> with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still	232.2967
unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels	83.3899
important and urgent said he	158.5440
in particular there is one yonder of a gascon look	439.9572
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment	50.3505
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	172.9589
noirtier how	2100.3203
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said	150.8966
let her alone said he	192.8847
do as i do	85.8782
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her	102.6874
you have done thisi hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees	54.3214
what do you say to that i might answer sire that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to <UNK> upon one condition sire what it is that your majesty will make him come here will	125.3565
interrogate him yourself <UNK> without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke what then you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say yes sire you will accept his judgment undoubtedly and you will submit to the reparation he may require certainly la chesnaye said the king	147.8478
i hope so the friends embraced cordially dartagnan pressed raouls hand	808.0103
how long will this fuse burn asked this person	2484.1780
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat	104.6009
ah m	451.8511
de villefort entered his fathers room followed by madame de villefort	29.4042
that is all i require	56.6631
to the smaller i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen well what has happened to them they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and dartagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by	122.9754
eight men the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to	212.7343
tell me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken <UNK> as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis	259.2473
i cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis	422.5880
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down	91.7562
he had received in the chest the bullet of dartagnans first adversary	299.7329
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath	124.9231
aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the rest <UNK> the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion i resolved to set	224.7076
out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the <UNK> of the italian kingdom but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me and	328.1334
my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino	189.8956
danglars trembled too morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this cannot be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent <UNK> mean about the year yes replied m	442.1384
i shall find many men as able as you are i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	95.1854
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m	56.9520
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain <UNK> of course on the part of the hostess	623.7559
the knife fell to the ground	69.3459
but our troop horses said aramis	760.6381
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope	276.3561
i expected this said felton	266.5017
the old man winked his eyes <UNK> which we may remember was his only way of expressing his <UNK>	1478.3004
pass on replied the guard	222.8290
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur long life to his eminence long life to the great cardinal the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m	188.3181
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet	113.3611
why my companion	427.0524
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio	1267.5314
then you pity me sincerely madame and you understand what brings me here you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened yes sira fearful misfortune you mean a mischance a mischance repeated the baroness	331.7841
chapter <UNK>	4619956.0000
and madame danglars four m	637.9327
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale	434.6059
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	337.5577
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear	381.9714
robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more <UNK> as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the académie royale	591.4372
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages eh eh said bonacieux <UNK> a plump round bag which returned of sound a money what do you think of this madame preacher whence comes that money you do not guess from the cardinal from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort the	447.1154
comte de rochefort why it was he who carried me off that may be madame and you receive silver from that man have you not said that that abduction was entirely political yes but that abduction had for its object the <UNK> of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my	301.9426
august mistress madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what	234.3325
do you say i say you are a miserable creature continued mme	45.9840
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better	71.9007
all i ask is permission to remain abed would you like to have a physician called said the woman	320.9597
around the <UNK> lay a number of small <UNK> belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen	757.5527
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation	81.9946
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too	69.6043
de villefort yes sire and he comes from marseilles in person why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	115.9712
the count read it	53.6305
de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil	48.5604
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls the duke smiled	277.3465
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic	110.4349
never had <UNK> the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a <UNK> or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure	1063.1041
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and <UNK> while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia	696.4703
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds gone	156.5465
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he <UNK> me and has murdered me i have also sent for the procureur he will not come in time i feel my life fast <UNK> wait	154.2523
a moment said monte cristo	22.3127
a <UNK> murmured my <UNK> he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols	3049.3250
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report	132.6314
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo	43.9018
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room	40.0432
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a <UNK> of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven <UNK> however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at	228.8541
a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to	124.3911
his _protégé_ monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville	87.4976
a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their <UNK>	563.5839
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	3093.8289
the evening of the betrothal chapter	157.5588
only a few days replied monte cristo	27.5789
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in	174.5033
the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent	219.2128
with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	208.9168
de tréville was informed by dartagnan and porthos of the circumstance	54.6110
your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is porthoss purse too he put it into his pocket	169.8751
nevertheless whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey she resolutely drew near to aramiss shutter and tapped at three equal intervals with her bent finger	252.2738
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	168.3019
you know one cannot change his nature he said	175.8413
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks	198.4595
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are today dartagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails	228.8249
albert could not understand the bankers look and turning to monte cristo who understood it <UNK> you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can i tell you because i imagine you have	103.5283
correspondents in that country monte cristo smiled significantly	285.0106
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them	270.6243
the servant announced m	300.3175
providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner	112.3924
i may continue to rely upon it may i not oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majestys service well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to me	109.8372
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of dartagnan and porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile	125.9555
pray continue well then listen	295.1012
the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and granddaughter of henry iv the wife and daughter of charles i	370.9040
i did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile i came to touch and he rapped his pocketbook in which he had just placed a letter	98.6243
she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed help help m what is the matter asked m	126.6167

my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent	98.5644
he found her in a charming humor	90.0885
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression	294.6820
one plays with anybody but one fights only with equals and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice	157.3847
in a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed	772.4455
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel morrel	69.4063
her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond chapter	554.5945
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party and what is the origin of this name it seems that some days since councillor <UNK> remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> round paris young <UNK> who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion	1631.0563

nobody serves me for nothing	370.2078
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly	126.8709
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle <UNK> fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing <UNK> malediction on desdemona	1733.6503
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	84.3798
dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my fathers commands it is more on your account than my own but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the <UNK> picture so gloomy a future because i judge it from the past still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed	167.5417
an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance	355.5529
there were not <UNK> however <UNK> of what we may call the intelligent <UNK> of a youth who is charmed with the <UNK> careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage	1191.8955
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives but what is that to me provided i see you again all this is perhaps <UNK> insanity but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love what queen a servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse	239.8553

foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an <UNK> so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with dartagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short	295.8296

the young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers breast	54.4988
the two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective <UNK>	629.1846
ah i understand athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to <UNK> his <UNK> place by the name of chateau	428.1988
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating	175.4472
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m	146.3173
julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawingroom with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allées de meilhan	99.9288
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt	155.5479
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together	2100.9592
<UNK> was <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> do not <UNK> it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious _fête_ mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor	1393.9813
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat	48.1829
bonacieux with a halfsmile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience	194.4543
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the <UNK> of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then <UNK> <UNK> him he managed to reach the abbés chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on	333.8032
his bed	343.3127
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation	230.4153
the monk	660.1506
grimaud gave a grim smile	520.1647

and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit	674.5625
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards franz are you m	229.0237
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly dartagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a <UNK> <UNK>	1528.6844
chapter vii	1322.8684
you are ungrateful dartagnan said athos yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner	126.6457
but so it is a woman will often from mere <UNK> prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe	630.7526
ah by notre dame as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms	276.1873
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act	114.4980
chapter	nan
alas i do replied athos with a deep sigh	41.8646
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	452.6037

monte cristo has received into his house and who is going to marry mademoiselle danglars exactly and you suffer that you <UNK> who know his life and his crime why should i stand in a comrades way said caderousse	154.7073
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great however my mother had still some hope	438.5357
dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who <UNK> the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods	466.4613
by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars	361.1162
except your signature and your partners m	672.6789
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	90.5566
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head	96.2758
then an idea came to him which <UNK> everything	2341.5754
devil take the vain fellow said dartagnan	112.6516
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre is your steward also a nubian asked debray	397.0487
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain	235.2949
there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church <UNK> women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs <UNK> of the man of quality a league off	533.8466
what do you say to a thousand crowns dartagnan <UNK> out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner	276.5632
athos smiled	63.0038
one of the culprits will be _mazzolato_ he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity	207.1149
and why so	142.3308
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money no to the cardinal its the same thing cried the young woman	174.0854
the door opened and dartagnan went into the chamber	19.8068
but here is the letter very well said the prince give it to me later	54.0710
ah replied he guessing franzs thought i know this is a serious matter what should you do in my place i who have nothing to <UNK> should go m you would accept yes were it only out of curiosity there is something very peculiar about this chief then listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is	206.2338
<UNK> stopped to see if anyone was near	213.9117
no you are a physician well i tell you i will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner the bare idea would kill <UNK> drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my fingernails and if you were mistaken <UNK> it were not my <UNK> i should come one day pale as a	276.0616
spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my <UNK> that should happen although i am a christian m	384.7814
danglars was there <UNK> recollect m	11687.6748

the duc de beaufort	17.0816
if they continue to advance we must fire again	158.1989

misfortune <UNK> the memory	55579.3867
planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of paris and to march on charenton when necessary	120.2877
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful <UNK> floated in the breeze	575.6477
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	174.7615
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it	148.9217
had the unhappy man on whom she <UNK> her <UNK> been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	586.1673
begone and may god guide you amen cried the young man and set off at full gallop	136.4823
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazins house	77.5971
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	354.2271
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	156.5754
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet_ thats it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had even to his horse monsieur for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was <UNK> monsieur porthoss horse as well as his masters	198.2505
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting	82.1254
oh that is no impediment sir said she i have had greater men than you <UNK> mazarin sprang forward	498.2419
twenty times he <UNK> for edmond	4498.9834
the motive given for all the taxes <UNK> imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy	391.2171
yes yes very sure perhaps you did not see well oh if i were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak i should know <UNK> milady was dressing herself all the time	171.8824
thirtyfive or thirtysix mother so <UNK> is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection	389.1781
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around	65.3818
no cried porthos there go three or four <UNK> away in fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city	395.0098
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble	252.7595
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis	99.6272
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti	583.6761
speak that your eminence will go at once to the queen what for merely to say these words i am going to send monsieur dartagnan away and i wish him to set out directly i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake what is the	53.0941
meaning of that may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence very well i will go	55.4857
bertuccio had <UNK> himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed	377.9742
she had only one day left	102.3692
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued	80.3526
i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening	124.9196
he meets albert de morcerf in <UNK> is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he <UNK> himself to madame danglarsit is that he may give her a royal present your stepmother and her son pass before his doorit is that his nubian may save them from destruction	477.5709
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck	165.6953
de tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him everything	65.2884
rochefort obeyed and retired	113.6213
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	296.5177
i have seen <UNK> devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm <UNK> to this <UNK> <UNK>	868.4883
of poison certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly <UNK> against the poison to which he had not been accustomed yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it oh very easily	157.5020
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg electronic works in your possession	45.5976
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant	119.6182
chapter xxiii	266.0772
albert rejoined his mother she was very pale	84.5266
he the man who would be popular cannot forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer and this marriage broken off without a reason being <UNK> it is all from the same cause make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason make inquiries and if it be true oh yes if it be true cried the young man he	182.8405
shall pay me all i have suffered beware morcerf he is already an old man i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally	136.6577
without <UNK> his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	866.8069
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the counts hand and covered it with kisses	103.7421
felton arose	414.6736
look said dartagnan day is declining	1854.5756
the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no in the rue meslay	117.7354
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you i have <UNK> my affections and like all <UNK> i am of evil omen to those who surround me no mercédès said monte cristo no you judge yourself with too much severity	384.9578
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend	70.4827
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but wewe shall remain i have a presentiment that we shall yes replied dartagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our <UNK> that famous napkin of the bastion st gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleursdelis embroidered be it so cried aramis	619.6370
to meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easychair	191.0744
well replied dartagnan bending his mouth to athoss ear and lowering his voice milady is marked with a _fleurdelis_ upon her shoulder ah cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his heart	77.9262
i will go myself and fetch the lemonade davrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame de villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen	148.9651
on the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawingroom to the right of the drawingroom a library and a study to the left a bedroom and a dressingroom	86.8697
now go down said the abbé folding his arms	52.0728
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres	66.5628
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos	150.0777
have you seen him yes sir said mordaunt	14.3536
suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat	132.7918
ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready as he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the two young men arose and entered the breakfastroom	290.8907
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an <UNK> smile of satisfaction	241.9204
tony carries our muskets then we set sail tonight asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished	238.9414
but i think i have it said athos	26.7995
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word	63.1203
lean upon me and let us return to the camp yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such <UNK> but is it not to have me hanged you have my word said he for the second time i give you your life the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but dartagnan who had	92.8169
no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude	776.6747
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan	281.8010
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage	266.6078
milady had told the <UNK> head was confused for her <UNK> plans <UNK> one another like chaos	12975.3438
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal	843.1472
de tréville thought it best to be first in making the complaint	185.9181
through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second the window turned on its hinges and a man entered	121.1899
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal	271.5694
de villeforts but lets get back to the subject talking of that said debray madame was making inquiries about that house which for the last three months has been hung with black who is madame asked châteaurenaud	246.6875
but as you are the strongest after all continued dartagnan dont be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked dartagnan with an eloquent look	244.6212
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate dartagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the porte richelieu	127.2714
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale <UNK>	252.9735
the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an <UNK> of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of	266.0465
to francs	31030.4961
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses	221.7492
noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	567.5818
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at <UNK> who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist <UNK> <UNK> for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine ah said the count that is a most conjugal <UNK> i recollect that at rome you said something of	873.9174
a projected marriage	50445.7773
bonacieux shuddering	24570.1641
de trévilles recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid and he put his horse into a trot	397.7968
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his <UNK> stood up with his arms crossed	143.0016
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish	583.8269
étienne soon returned from his errand	258.9294
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life alas would i could weep like you and he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much	193.3673
nothing therefore was settled that day as emerys head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence	458.6200
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people	178.6510
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of <UNK> idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon	226.3572
have you had any account of it none	62.1483
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort delbeuf and de bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is	184.3473
broken <UNK> you going to try to take charenton such are my orders sir since you command the cavalry pardon me i am <UNK> so much the better	623.3782
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that <UNK> importance that it demanded the <UNK> attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him	304.2544
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord buckingham	117.8183
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice dont touch them devil take me if i taste one of them murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry there was silence	187.9073
it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her	82.2535
the steward attempted to <UNK>	6860.0659
read me her letter oh my lord said laporte	122.7450
the young girls lover was in cucumettos troop his name was carlini	459.1763
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible	257.3197
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have the comte de wardes of thursday and the dartagnan of today are the same person the imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with <UNK> slight storm which would resolve itself into tears but he was strangely deceived and his error was not of long duration	397.6728
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be <UNK> to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	202.6348
the young lady went towards madame morrel	97.2991
dartagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen	35.3653
you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom i am obliged to live	284.1314

you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful <UNK> lovely <UNK> large diamonds	897.3852
gentlemen cried the coadjutor <UNK> his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military <UNK> over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy approaching	2466.6436
grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair	89.1823

a lion even ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion	2331.8506
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses	118.2212
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer	151.4303
i know what i wish to know follow me the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions	124.1304
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the <UNK> of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet	283.5678
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through <UNK> of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yewtrees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought	388.9738
andrea assumed his gayest manner	1433.7905
then he drew from his waistcoatpocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a <UNK> about the size of a <UNK> which he placed in her hand	266.5457
grimaud sprang up	71.8426
he turned up a king	143.0341
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her <UNK> of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act	303.9688
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent <UNK> and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter after all the <UNK> which were made this morning m	245.4902
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion <UNK> his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the <UNK> by an outward flight of steps	385.3647
after supper when they are <UNK> i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by dartagnans inventive imagination	247.5946
now for the <UNK> athos threw himself into dartagnans arms	706.3366
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the <UNK>	261.2538
there he cried	303.5177
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box	103.8463
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawingroom before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a <UNK> and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his <UNK> and cares since his noble fathers departure	285.7013
only we conspire against the rochellais ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming the color mounted to the face of athos and he	138.2292
made a step toward his eminence	38.4881
i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you and who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration	97.9153
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy and died that must have cut short the projects of	335.3666

altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his <UNK> organs after his death bah said beauchamp he played the prince very well yes for you who detest those unhappy princes beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very	393.2368

how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	394.5070
my god what do you fear everything replied athos	58.7681
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so everything answered <UNK> voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead ii live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	687.1291
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice dartagnan turned round as if a serpent had <UNK> him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the guardsman who had just made this insolent speech	183.5441
if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow	154.2120
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured dartagnan	202.9740
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature	3426.6440
i have seen the bastille	43.2160
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around	75.4668
oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle darmilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might <UNK> it at a single blow	205.7638
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred ah _ma foi_ who is to know perhaps it is some political difference my father and the baron dépinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort	139.3518
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light	98.3618

gleamed from the eyes of milady	24.5814
what men call the chances of <UNK> ruin change <UNK> have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me	1773.0675
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid <UNK> my own	498.6451
morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimneypiece but availing himself of the doctors order the old man would not take any <UNK> at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond	162.4173
again tell him i die blessing him the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat	228.9930
perhaps you liked what m	305.4903
morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting	124.1106
answer me on what i could get you lie repeated the abbé a third time with a still more imperative tone	138.1626
mercédès i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen <UNK> years i wept i cursed now i tell you mercédès i must revenge myself the count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred	307.2223

<UNK> truly guilty the truly guilty said milady is the <UNK> of england the persecutor of true believers the base ravisher of the honor of so many <UNK> who to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart is about to make england shed so much blood who protects the protestants today and will betray them tomorrow buckingham it is then buckingham cried felton	825.9988
in a high state of excitement	148.3907
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how <UNK> i related the whole of what i had seen and heard	377.8886
five or six minutes elapsed	29.7082
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps	305.9878
the duc de beaufort	17.0816

all is ready sire said he	92.0312
you received me very coldly	767.9272
on the morrow he received the last touches of mousquetons brush for an hour and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune	145.3903
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved <UNK> though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors	241.9124

ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a <UNK> one my dear madame uttered fresh sighs	1051.2092
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven	414.7586
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a housethe opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villeforts bell to summon the <UNK> mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age	311.3034
the presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard	276.9508
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it	192.7303
everyone hastened to purchase <UNK> and albert among the rest	1099.2225
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not <UNK> who stood before them	124.5779
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the <UNK> of sand unobserved	486.7030
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	50.5737
the poor devil would eat nothing from fear it is incredible no my dear fellow it is not at all incredible	133.5609

make way for us planchet said dartagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass they are friends the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who	122.0000
had held his breath ventured to breathe again	340.0780

the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château dif dantès nevertheless determined to make for them	188.4632
the doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to noirtier said abruptly how do you find <UNK> yes have you any weight on the chest or does your stomach feel light and <UNK> yes then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am	316.0610

de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm	171.5840
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger	72.0890
you are laughing at him caderousse no he replied only hark how he sighs come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us	349.9215

oh madame cried mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges	247.5109
dartagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast	75.2840
he found pleasure in feeling the water <UNK> over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish <UNK>	1095.9871
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile	221.8450
the heart of dartagnan swam in delirium he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly	519.0421
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in <UNK> his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise <UNK> <UNK> i shall find you tomorrow at charenton oh dont be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the	306.4283

read and answer or i will blow out your brains the sergeant saw that dartagnan was in earnest	163.0939
now nothing of the kind has happened what then asked hermine trembling violently	339.7495

when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that dartagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind	102.2651
speak <UNK> am listening said villefort <UNK> am prepared for everything madame de saintméran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes	533.4778

luigi was not mistaken	38.2893
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word	185.0672
and as to this book added she pointing to the <UNK> with her finger but without touching it as if she must be <UNK> by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de <UNK> accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies felton made no reply took the	303.7225
book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively	191.7101
no no be easy on that score	120.4048
instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to st germain my dear fellow said athos i ride horses when i have any when i have none i go <UNK> well said dartagnan smiling at the misanthropy of athos which from any other person would have offended him	148.5035

night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps	94.5810

loyalty of his purpose	98.6412
i have paid you five hundred of them thats correct said the captain	85.8346
dartagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends	138.5204
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away	202.7346
scarcely had dartagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	149.4062
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him	141.7607

he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living	221.3539
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very <UNK> reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta	229.9513

the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the <UNK> of woman	276.1114
this is all very easy for you to say replied dartagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your	151.9875

dartagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	279.5160
look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown <UNK> frank and honorable countenance to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of dartagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with dartagnan	505.7017
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy <UNK> of parisian fashion had to carry with him the <UNK> reflection that he had nearly <UNK> italy without meeting with a single adventure	539.4475
dartagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all <UNK> means to prevent the <UNK> of the bloody tragedy	1440.1951

this look of porthoss made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning	239.0308
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing	110.7402

villefort rose and ran towards his motherinlaw for it was she	87.2045
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person	262.9236
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and i shall die without absolution	126.8960
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many <UNK> to be seen on the road to the low countries and as ninetenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every	704.2444

lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away	60.6168
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away	81.2336
in dying i will say to those around me what <UNK> wrote to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable	2557.2720
besides one must lay out ones inheritance somehow ah porthos cried one of his companions dont try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity	587.5122
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of francs per annum paid <UNK>	389.2514
danglars said another sign in the negative	150.8255
that did not come from a man without a heart	91.1466
this time it _was_ the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience	415.4282
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five oclock was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one muttered dartagnan	103.7961
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden <UNK> he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie <UNK> emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than <UNK> his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count	553.3736
you understand this do you not my most precious wife	219.3687
yes replied porthos <UNK>	10323.8623
dantès house you will be at rest	475.6303
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this <UNK> it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle darmilly of whom he had heard much	125.3031
m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young mens minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld	267.8951
where she was known as la <UNK> <UNK> she was the widow of the marquis de <UNK> when she married de ganges and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new <UNK> was forced by them to take poison and they finished her off with pistol and <UNK> magistrate and orator of great <UNK> of france under louis xv	841.6586
so once more goodnight caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	327.4368
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children	79.4076
monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped	57.6835
this tranquillity proved one thingthat dartagnan did not yet know milady	486.1739
until then you will not see me	26.9633
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm good the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window	214.6924

i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the <UNK> suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing	268.4292
the countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart	159.3484
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less	368.7835
as to that we know dartagnans courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle	129.6772
for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her at the hotel de ville my dear fellow what at the hotel de ville	49.3667
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful	89.1826
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m	226.6409
yes yes continued morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears	282.1115
alight planchet and inquire for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do planchet alighted	238.9675
the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen	81.5412
you know it is you alone whom i love how can i know that by the scorn i will throw upon her dartagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously	127.1379
indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them	186.1827
she was within three steps of the bottom she already heard morrels voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and <UNK> to the floor	264.1089
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one <UNK> just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of	201.0179
the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée	227.6062
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france take care athos cried dartagnan	133.3618
dont you see they are aiming yes yes said athos but they are only <UNK> bad <UNK> who will be sure not to hit me in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him	239.9496
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc dangoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where	170.2581
they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	272.0699
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear	527.5685
the _mandaïa_ never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times <UNK> like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer	2525.0010
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow	54.5155
chapter	nan
everything with him was <UNK> or <UNK>	88522.0078
everyone must live certainly go on i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself	104.0009
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m	91.0566
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper	127.1815
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her good murmured milady the austere puritan lies as to the soldier he only smiled	180.2531
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	238.5171
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end	267.2651
chapter lix	126.2178
the musketeer was introduced to m	49.7444
i have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that i might test your character and then surprise you	226.5815
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in mens clothes	1540.5889
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied eugénie	845.7279
saint denis	97.1360
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden	61.8962
he was not however a good sleeper	217.1145
should he find him at all	29.0885
is it not true aramis said porthos turning toward another musketeer	55.0372
tomorrow is the twentythird and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet he sets sail tomorrow where for for la rochelle he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	529.8861
and is it your cook who <UNK> these pills asked beauchamp	2670.8357
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman <UNK> do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have	118.9690
them why dont you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moments pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse	57.9327
the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean	383.6613
but then you yourself are known to others yes i am known so that proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti so that you will remit to me these francs certainly at your first request the majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment	293.7373
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	160.9624
i have not seen you nor your friends and i dont think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey far from here oh lord no about forty leagues only	112.6712
when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood <UNK> afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath then fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last <UNK> and expired	209.2469
mordaunt was among these	192.3040
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or <UNK> the frequent <UNK> of <UNK> lips	2226.6912
the baroness then thought of m	143.2257
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature <UNK> after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the <UNK> of his vision and once more awakened memory	579.6989
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a <UNK> for julie who never played	635.1491
was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner the london executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead	147.5410
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as dartagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him	89.4285
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration	131.3711
dartagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue <UNK> is now situated breathing the balmy <UNK> which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night	292.9026
well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	154.1654
on whom does my bleeding heart repose	5653.6230
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber	308.1724
pardon me said albert i was not aware that he was a prince	17.2990
i only wait till you give them you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat	89.0174
thus made yes for i have the proofs i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation without doubt	175.7813
there are in this bag three hundred pistoles	82.5190
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp	163.6171
the valet entered	112.8262
i am not obliged to read any breviary	171.9143
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets	171.0760
but you know him m	65.9652
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity	436.5547
he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself	106.2243
m	nan
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted haydées arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands	89.1651
then on the anniversary of the day on which i had been insulted i hung my cassock on a peg assumed the costume of a cavalier and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which i knew my man was invited	126.6433
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain <UNK> and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	391.6710
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come m you think then all is not over yet said albert <UNK>	438.4937
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same <UNK> with everyone else and without any particular privilege	374.5002
the rendezvous dartagnan ran home immediately and although it was three oclock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure	107.7911
bring here immediately the kings attorney m	280.0894
the queen on her part thus <UNK> softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer	373.2502
tomorrow this evening perhaps i shall see him again and then the past will no longer exist this evening asked milady roused from her reverie by these words	96.2098
goodday penelon returned morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain the captain m	315.9297
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made you insist yes i insist permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising	85.7215
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret	70.7762
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	237.4678
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go <UNK> listen sire said blacas who had for a	146.7574
moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a <UNK> man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a	316.3369
great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> continued louis xviii still <UNK>	14042.2197
it is well said monte cristo	11.6168
with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of france	270.6505
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said dartagnan to athos	201.5133
and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to <UNK> castle	551.2872
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway	322.6805
the others followed	1180.8810
it is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said aramis	183.4680
i wager anything said albert interrupting her that i know what you were about to say well what is it if i guess rightly will you confess it yes on your honor on my honor you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expected not at all	75.7858
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherds life was vampas reply	137.3475
we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting tomorrow oh as to that sir replied chatillon for it was he who with flamarens was leaving the duc de beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it	174.6062
i hope that is true said aramis	21.6296
yes but it was fated that i should not keep it so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him and this one had his said dartagnan but as good luck would have it just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage our	121.8269
friend was brought home with a broken leg	461.1365
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the <UNK> tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered	326.5789
and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated	165.5439
now in the opinion of dartagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off mme	67.1829
the result was that when the newcomer left the hotel with the _cicerone_ a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used	131.3022
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn silence for monsieur porthoss idea said aramis	85.2508
danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant put in your head he was making rapid progress in italian	1035.3378
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but dartagnan confined himself to telling them that m	180.9725
the queen had at first positively refused but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly	391.3725
eh your excellency	35.1568
no longer could edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	180.5141
forward planchet forward you are a brave fellow as i told you monsieur replied planchet <UNK> are found out by being used	288.4885
it was worn by my father a loyal gentleman	108.2160
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing	374.7900
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at dartagnan who was counting on his fingers	139.5028
that depends when do you leave tomorrow evening at five oclock in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning	115.2581
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off	316.9788
thats well	36.9294
oh pray for mercys sake dont fly from me	311.6509
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the <UNK> of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate	172.1399
have you not let it go out of your hands no davrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them	111.7936
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet dartagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant	100.5865
dartagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important <UNK>	151.2145
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with <UNK> nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry	131.4995
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face <UNK> both gravity and sweetness of expression	310.6012
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	204.2254
all this looks suspicious they said a quarter of an hour	119.8390
this will teach you said dartagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion god	452.5139
in whom can i trust place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger but i must write oh yes that is indispensable	157.8102
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander king of <UNK>	425.6161
dartagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men	118.1560
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	138.0754
they are robbers perhaps he muttered	419.3776
yes said they we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last fiveandtwenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england	311.6056
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men madame said mazarin your majesty <UNK> me with flattering distinction he is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand	214.6149
give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions	185.1505
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before	213.3047
the count praised bertuccios zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month	226.6527
yes and pretty tight too i can tell you was the answer	198.0178
dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviiis throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire	323.1994
allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to do you are right monsieur it is not with you that i have anything to do it is with madame with madame you do not know her replied the stranger	53.3732
come now he said	46.3754
thieves might strip the <UNK> would annoy me less than to be disobeyed baptistin bowed	1156.1973
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	203.6994
what for	778.9409
he remembered how at the louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full <UNK> of her dazzling charms the beautiful madame de longueville	201.0739
three brigands called <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism	23791.2949
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand which whichever you <UNK> to the left here sire i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right i mean on my <UNK> there	208.5920
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find mme	187.2311
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantès jailer	464.6354
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	42.4398
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word	210.3570
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian	204.4084
we on our side do the same	120.6297
at last cried dartagnan	96.0569
goodday commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him	221.3567
you are a lieutenant	38.3530
where is the count friend	72.6224
you have done well to warn me	38.6146
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well	78.6561
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well <UNK> was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	204.9326
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles	64.9912
ah you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible	212.7183
here said she you see i have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold but you oh i am never cold you know besides with these mens clothes will you dress here certainly shall you have time do not be uneasy you little coward all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair	209.3593
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier	113.1797
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it	263.2422
tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny morrel to pray sometimes for a man who like satan thought himself for an instant equal to god but who now <UNK> with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom	724.0809
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of <UNK> of <UNK> him	3281.0750
when i like caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	111.2052
cavalcanti with your daughter and mademoiselle darmilly said the banker do you consider her no one then turning to monte cristo he said prince cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not	68.6344
this unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in paris on the tenth of january and the prince of conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of paris	229.8047
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion	110.9035
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him	200.0822
yes that is the very boy hes <UNK> by bazin ah yes i know of what importance is this little <UNK> to you asked porthos	486.5818
chapter xxxii	103.3633

two open	37696.9141
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew him	63.4091
caderousse entered hastily	535.8340
the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the <UNK> that m	277.3233
but she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible in whatsoever way it is absorbed it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death precisely so cried monte <UNK> so and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte	440.7087
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain thatand i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight i worked at night also replied faria	217.1319
and aramis said the duchess quickly	141.8611
then listen said he	68.7459
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by <UNK> is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your	463.0109
fellowcreatures this indeed is <UNK> more it is sublime m albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm	428.9823
listen for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream	292.1197
his majesty king louis xiii	191.1479
dartagnan however gathered from his <UNK> replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey	316.1817
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the <UNK> of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis	317.0654
dartagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in english come being with the classic english oath the only english words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck	153.1445
it was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak	90.8125
finally milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips	60.1739
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers	96.2745
de villefort who lives in the faubourg sainthonoré	38.4462
<UNK> <UNK> said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up dartagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little and why dartagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis	161.2594
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession then said the count i refer you to your confessor	151.2567
then mine is the boat you want sir	229.9843

no part of the programme <UNK> names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information	1142.4302
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects <UNK> of either	607.0348
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand yes said dartagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you cant think that dartagnan dartagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	192.5309
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at <UNK> and scratches himself for amusement added the king	2080.4526

the very dogs that wander <UNK> and <UNK> in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief	542.7820
we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said albert but to demand an explanation the young mans trembling voice was scarcely audible	241.5744
are you not well tis nothing nothing it will soon pass <UNK> as he said so the old mans strength failed him and he fell backwards	342.0276
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond	222.1948

de trévilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m	61.8994
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugénie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing	282.9525
but to grieve my <UNK> disturb my grandmothers last <UNK> you are right said morrel calmly	2424.4761
your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and i advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal why i am ready to tell everything cried bonacieux at least all that i know	107.7132
he was supplied with bread of a <UNK> <UNK> quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine	1222.0883
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her	75.8932
the two friends turned down the first street they came to	45.2037
oh heavens exclaimed morrel i do not deceive <UNK> young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf yes said monte cristo i recognized him how <UNK> were looking the other way m the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply	133.1191
and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street	51.8494
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	50.8644
come said dartagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks <UNK> and all the <UNK> for a fencing match	332.1814
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie said he	159.3174
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	35.4530
i think it will be wise to set off said dartagnan	44.5417
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any womans face would have expressed disdain but in a queens spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive	221.3607
you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign madame replied dartagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so	165.4669
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of <UNK> is no other than count fernand of morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to	246.6076
prevent the light from reaching him	332.0612
at sight of this man dartagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door	77.6604
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said dartagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am	68.0643
ignorant	nan
we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim	148.0604
morrel said he as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from aix or toulon	91.3085
it is nearly eight oclock and at nine i expect a visit	111.6648
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge	153.7409
this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage ah she has a carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted porthos one of whose faults was a great <UNK> of tongue	188.0721
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julies cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the	251.7914
count	nan
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame	111.7984
how did this happen said morrel	110.7485
peppino mounted the seat behind	167.9805
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin how far is mazingarbe two miles and a half thank you grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from	177.4650
the room occupied by the monk and the dying man	59.6617
at the letter s the old man stopped her	249.9119
say no more about it _peste_ you come to your <UNK> quickly	614.1492

the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources	274.9434
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	133.8815
dépinay replied morrel	103.4755
on your brow i read <UNK> lips <UNK> ere you announce some terrible <UNK> hands tremble	16932.4160
the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were <UNK> of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers	504.0372
upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were <UNK> in his heart silently and drop by drop	277.9849
noirtiers eye was fixed on the dictionary	39.2419
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep tonight madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and	179.8127
from astonishment to stupefaction	2839.2356
the count understood him	88.1017
oh the women the women cried the old soldier	127.4056
chapter lxx	568.1539
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence	566.6972
but to dantès eye there was no darkness	437.3450
is it large <UNK> how is it arranged faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan they are all here said caderousse briskly	518.9050
eh i read it a little while since	202.2345
i should like to offer him a last salute	232.5609
among worldly people manner is <UNK>	60826.8242
but remorse is not thus banished like virgils wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair	196.7396
he cannot possibly serve you as a <UNK> for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere <UNK> dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment	384.0529
great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means well returned mazarin we will satisfy you richelieu thought dartagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance you will then be at my service asked mazarin	306.0811
you are <UNK> which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter	301.7466
at the extremity of the wood dartagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle	48.7442
most of my readers are aware that the second act of <UNK> opens with the celebrated and effective <UNK> in which <UNK> while sleeping betrays to <UNK> the secret of her love for <UNK>	2048.8899
but i am not yet ready to receive it very well	33.5815
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there very well monsieur said planchet	57.0729
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight	142.8927
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand	693.6691
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning	139.2060
i cannot make you share the fate i have <UNK> for myself	316.8845
there is nobody within said bonacieux	982.2458
he had my love that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains	253.0290
take this peach then she said	347.2494
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has	70.2720
fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who	151.6525
was that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count	87.5447
as regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know monsieur dartagnan that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you	176.9988
and what friends awaited him without	305.3018
i have now to confess to you	37.8641
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the <UNK> madame here are notes of francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron to this i add a certificate in the funds of francs then for the odd cash making i think about francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m	489.5953
gentlemen said dartagnan you shall have your turn	28.7731
that was what he could not know	28.0758
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and <UNK> the cheek	526.5488
bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend	110.2014
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies	153.9287
men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place athos not having reappeared m	154.0407
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell said mazarin	227.3210
go the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him	212.0314
noble and unhappy king are you wounded cried aramis	148.2966
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	178.3710
de trévilles note in the other	104.1358
when do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to caderousse	69.3923
i point one of the poniards at la ramees breast and i say to him my friend i am sorry for it but if thou <UNK> if thou <UNK> one cry thou art a dead man the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words	222.7659
dartagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out	51.7045
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty	37.2298
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends	145.1431
de busigny	2061.7246
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur dartagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen	51.9064
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker	88.3002
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed have you no letter for him asked the young man	230.8159
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes	71.3300
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier dartagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known dartagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos	105.6317
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m	138.8216
only remember on the th of october morrel i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo	57.7286
as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it	57.6704
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the corso	57.2505
m what do you wish to see first asked the abbé	21.9189
the count was no longer young	46.0133
undoubtedly the call came from farias dungeon	4020.6355
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth	101.9114
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake what happened during the night asked beauchamp of châteaurenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble	258.6193
replied the baron	26.1840
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment dartagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	236.3278
and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them there	43.8146
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers dartagnan felt completely solitary	253.1948
lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid <UNK> could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more <UNK> in the nose	496.1244
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure	1170.5198
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	95.4316
never did funeral knell never did <UNK> produce a greater effect on the <UNK>	7200.8081
go to go to i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived	385.3949
can all this force be summoned on my account thought he	212.6037
hush whispered de guiche these are cavaliers yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted can you see what they are doing yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche	262.4323
egad yes but why dont you come there also athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here	162.3114
but first interposed dartagnan you must present me to madame du vallon a third sigh from porthos	256.2397
chapter xxxviii	59.9021
one evening i was in a garden a clump of trees concealed me no one suspected i was there	92.8052
the gascon gave a last <UNK> to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs	238.1222
i know it well so take grimaud take mousqueton take bazin take planchet	577.0157
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises	137.6141
m she pointed to each letter of the alphabet	169.4641
bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messengers words	88.8785
anne of austria sought to read in mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired	140.2143
but it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion yes thats probable said dartagnan	120.1549
in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria who was in her oratory with the young king louis xiv to receive the cardinal	221.9485

what next asked albert	423.7755
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three <UNK> whenever it came within reach of his hand	195.3604
two methods of <UNK> were at his disposal	1277.2625
oh he cried athos athos thou man of noble heart woe is me i have let thee perish at this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same <UNK> which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a	326.5549
pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated	232.4666
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	291.8681
the jesuit persisted in his opinion	259.0721
she will be the sooner with her mother	83.5160
come said athos heres another good servant	331.8300
another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered <UNK> and the <UNK> while a fifth clung to the broken <UNK>	2477.5544
and aramis i see you have not forgotten the name no she said poor aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses	340.0457
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune	88.5285
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him	140.1242
dartagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	113.0802
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew	346.9823
at ten minutes past five albert entered <UNK>	3316.9946
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	132.7292
the men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two	319.5211
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his fathers honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms	82.7275
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in <UNK> her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear	248.0820
<UNK> to the kings treasurer at blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pistoles assuredly said dartagnan i admire this piece of prose	157.2555
what do you think of that exploit my lord it is magnificent said mazarin thoughtfully	59.5528
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though <UNK> an apparition she	131.5696
then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious <UNK> as all his calculations were	234.2350
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday	84.8299
planchet sir lieutenant yesterday said aramis captain today colonel doubtless tomorrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france question him about the fight said athos	580.3748
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or <UNK> of those about me	240.6515
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity and will you make the same promise to my love cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	63.7388
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon <UNK>	3695.5645
now and then a <UNK> more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race	370.6732
a war of partisans unworthy of a king the example of robert <UNK> will absolve you sire no no i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of <UNK> treason shall fall on their heads sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father	400.9567
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it	134.1033
de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw franz and m	64.1647
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a <UNK> in france that henry iv the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with m	133.9166
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that dartagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence	117.0826
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary	61.4914
then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course	169.9638
unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition	426.2193
her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her brow	275.9236
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris	147.8143
this time without knowing why dartagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins	198.3774
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out	384.7654
the messenger resisted my brother killed him oh said mme	473.5913
and we too added beauchamp and châteaurenaud	362.0798
clear sky <UNK> boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château dif seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy	359.4660
we want said athos charlotte backson who first was called comtesse de la fère and afterwards milady de winter baroness of sheffield that is i that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself	184.2104
dartagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them	285.9379
franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the _moccoli_ and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello	30.2667
dartagnan followed the _soubrette_ with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where dartagnan had disappeared	138.6006
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel	107.9695
i will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your <UNK> at this almost brutal speech morrel turned <UNK> pale	566.1937
whom do i see yonder where in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a cloak it is he cried dartagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man	163.1708
i resisted	143295.9375
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain <UNK> you will not find him	128.7513
you will say that i keep it i will perform your commission word for word my lord and now resumed buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall i ever <UNK> myself of the debt i owe you dartagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes	129.7387
write to me at paris to m	44.8226
ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize halloo halloo friends to horse to horse several horsemen ran quickly to him	539.7102
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed	89.9985
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her	176.2035
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips <UNK> with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there	853.7403
mousqueton will lose another thats five and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful <UNK> a glass of wine and changed his clothes	258.0280

scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the kings attorney	162.7263
he has been hanged and <UNK> i hope my god my god cried dartagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure	230.7461

relation you <UNK> you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwells person	149.6428
dartagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply	38.2598
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own	46.5513
i expected thee said the bandit to ritas father	506.5959
he bowed with great friendship to the count	91.1058

besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible that is just the <UNK> so but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you	403.7498
when he arrives i will not fail to do so just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and <UNK> moustache respectfully bowed to madame de villefort	140.1737
dartagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_ which he improvised	291.8877
yes yes yes continued the old man	16.1411
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind dartagnan still directing them from behind with his voice	239.6049
i have something to say to you certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck	156.4214
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	282.1138

then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the <UNK> bedstead being of oak	331.4715
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep	171.0260
need we think of that since we are to save the king	40.9896
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought	673.7312
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis	134.7546

three days afterward pistache was found <UNK>	4332.8325

they are no doubt both curious and interesting yes yes but let us go	117.7037
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell down	409.0328
the southern districts were <UNK> in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or <UNK>	2959.1169
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the <UNK> behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	165.7098
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs	58.5634
dartagnan it is for you to accuse her first dartagnan advanced	240.7157
you were rich noble held in great <UNK> all that could render a man happy all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness only one thing said the italian	402.0406
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more <UNK> the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man	336.5638
bonacieux hesitated to continue	176.1888
he urged the horse again into a trot	354.0276
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving	54.7565

the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity	677.7318
the <UNK> of the bouquet kept her word she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after	436.5451
oh my god who could have said so the evening before	103.8313
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you	51.9130
you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow	262.3841
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to ritas father at frosinone	231.1891
no everyone would do that my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent albert advanced towards eugénie smiling	285.0311
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal	262.2989
de tréville was the father of his soldiers	43.8937
all this showed dartagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this veil	118.5515
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself	91.4729
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon	296.7403
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue you are stupid replied the cardinal	105.6776
come in tréville the duke saluted and retired	476.4929
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the kings example	190.8585
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	46.9898
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search	96.8440

these <UNK> <UNK> lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee la ramee came into the room	614.8824
it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler	172.2592
why you are mad albert m	136.5504

at this instant m	40.3413
to do with you my lord inquired aramis	55.9265
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	3689.3350
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it	107.4109
one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the _soubrette_ under the gateway of the hôtel but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed she took him gently by the hand	103.3252
but we have not done with the thing yet m do you indeed think so inquired the marquise	100.3283
de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden	99.9837
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor <UNK> and miserable <UNK> to fall into m	930.9686

do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were oh god forbid then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other	97.2678
well this man	90.9109
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject	148.8138
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living <UNK> the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with <UNK> that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very	767.6398
<UNK> of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns <UNK> off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms	358.2887
in the corridor he met mme	90.0949
to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirtysix degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit	1039.2203
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	95.6588
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example	99.2057
can you not tell me his name at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs	66.0136
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses morrel smiled	417.8085
do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life	110.2701
it was at this moment that people came <UNK> to the scene of action from all sides	206.1469
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	136.2789
toxicology chapter	30.6968
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison	238.1094
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he reentered the hôtel and flew toward kittys chamber	154.8622
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps	212.5069
then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz	188.1064
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at least	112.6929
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man <UNK> his arm	130.1755
and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased	68.7792
oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the <UNK> <UNK> masters in <UNK> favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities but said franz to	713.6771
the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law	206.6026
edmond amazed <UNK> filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles	947.9760
danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of <UNK> solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated <UNK> of the day	482.3123
your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately <UNK> your words	942.5976
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead	532.7277
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the <UNK> of strangers	217.5005
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his	124.0284
successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the <UNK> of a throne dust of the earth here i await thee there was profound silence	545.8415
charles smiled	185.5593
although he felt himself <UNK> supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step	255.2924
it does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four <UNK> and why among us four inquired caderousse	366.1916

in a few minutes laporte came into the room	26.9048
m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his <UNK> <UNK> that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse	258.5682
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today	79.5085

do you know him	5.6000
i suffered that is all yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	416.3198
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage	358.5047
can he be inconstant before being happy oh no he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart	123.4759
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released	202.2498

you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied	68.7041

having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twentyfive thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a	163.5388
million it would unhesitatingly have been given	86.7693

but <UNK> woman as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle <UNK> of your language what i mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes ah yes indeed said monte cristo with a sigh and do you think she	117.4843
is in the least interested in me i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else and does she try to make you dislike me on the contrary she often says morcerf i believe the	105.6106

he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	78.7942
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion on the honor of mazarin i should like another sort of oath better said dartagnan to himself then aloud may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen her majesty is asleep and you must set	138.5094

oh oh why really one would say that you four were <UNK> the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said dartagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see	235.1382
them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out finelooking men upon my word said dartagnan	151.6990
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and <UNK> the paper in his hands	1057.0515
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness	1088.8450
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo	226.3157
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key	94.1218
he is a fine young man of fair <UNK> little too fair <UNK> in manners but you will see and judge for yourself by the way said the major you know i have only the francs which the abbé busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money that is a matter of course my dear	197.7354

patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn	79.6363
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are <UNK> and <UNK> humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem	248.1660
and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried châteaurenaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism	620.1854
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked dartagnan	37.9209

he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to <UNK> the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal	155.8083
and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	127.5802
he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not <UNK> in two hours paris would be under arms	390.2378

at nine in the morning he reached <UNK> and stopped for breakfast	306.8668
danglars fancied that they had reached the longdesired point he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows	103.8787
you cannot go <UNK> road is bordered by trees on both sides <UNK> right said a voice almost lost in the distance	1283.4827
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	276.8604

as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had <UNK> the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real <UNK> loss occasioned by the <UNK> was to him but a trifle	545.7340
this measure somewhat reassured bonacieux	7430.7891

porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	218.0314

the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short	191.5138
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees	83.7879
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentines absence had done	661.6771

dartagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent	186.1042
<UNK> said porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur dartagnan is waiting for you in the stables porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well	102.5930

which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless milady looked at her lover in silence	643.3695
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her	114.4697
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the <UNK> sublime spot a restingplace full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and	234.4299

madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so <UNK> as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave	247.6345
the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	184.9166
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken and what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a <UNK> which he was taking to be <UNK>	295.6233
the lady with the red cushion produced a great <UNK> she was very <UNK> the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much <UNK> than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon dartagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and	310.9877
of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady	322.3776
the several members of that group were much excited	594.5110
the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them	75.7058
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children	269.3768
remain here fasten the door inside and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this and he tapped <UNK> taps close together and pretty hard the other after an interval and lighter	1032.7250
he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring	129.3183
you are madames brother i <UNK> it so but fortunately you are not mine it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual <UNK> in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman	275.5489
go <UNK> the pretty _soubrette_ cast an anxious glance at dartagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her	392.6743
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and <UNK> was in prison	624.2013
in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters	177.4501
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its <UNK> by force of arms	161.9154
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties	6951.7676
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	101.7791
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the <UNK> chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the <UNK> conversation which assumed as in the case of the <UNK> with danglars and morcerf a turn <UNK> to the persons if not to the situation	661.5743
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier	177.7031
we will explain in a few words how dartagnan had been led to choose that place of residence	128.3746
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the <UNK> all was over can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	237.2695
stay where you are i will go myself and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground dartagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier	140.4570
let me die that is all	42.3065
however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief	446.6766
well then said aramis	13.6612
oh bid him enter and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold	208.0046
m	nan
yes monsieur said dartagnan bowing we have had that honor	101.3651
no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose francs as you please my dear sir said the jeweller i had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet	75.5338
of banknotes	16764.2363
it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully <UNK> attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray	370.6052
and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room	56.3487
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows	117.5559
he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him	349.0992
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	90.4120
who rang asked valentine	1736.6786
the brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	1973.1106
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is magnificent	268.2829
noirtier gave his assent	456.8937
it would be <UNK> too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	105.8013
the duc <UNK> visited the posts	28893.4961
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you	747.2250
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which dartagnan took and shook in his	85.9504
was it the englishman who carried off crowns from here the other day m no he really had crowns and we found them	210.7156
oh you do not know what is seventeen months in <UNK> ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his <UNK> a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an <UNK> sees his prospects destroyed and	336.7827
is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited	502.0989
dartagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	106.6931
mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion	146.2695
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and <UNK> features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	264.8627
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	96.0226
ah count said he his father loves him so much do not speak to me of that said monte cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed i will make him suffer morrel amazed let fall monte cristos hand	94.8452

you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept	428.1034
the deed if you please mr notary and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors	199.9595
as for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him	33.9280
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch	163.0998
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	29.7743
cant you guess my dear athos	82.2228
it was then richelieus object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom	141.6763
i am so unhappy i have known a man much more unfortunate than you morrel impossible alas said monte cristo it is the <UNK> of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world listen morrel and	159.3307
pay attention to what i am about to tell you	23.5128
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber	51.1382
mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel	51.5163
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me	168.2658
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad hashish <UNK> became a dream for franz	611.9250
the abbé scarron	612.4943
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant and what do you think of her personal appearance oh i consider her perfectly <UNK> is just my idea of what <UNK> must have been franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with	192.6733
albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company	213.0033
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen	76.3274
it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance	60.7019
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this	162.0363
time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	165.7538
my faith it appears so said dartagnan	64.3014
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the <UNK> hinges and locks told quite another story	387.3875
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed it	88.0254
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace	64.8519
and what does he say asked porthos in a selfsufficient tone	33.6648
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known	156.0694
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but milady stopped her	120.8876
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles	1527.0868
yes continued mme	199.3373

toward the town of louvres was the reply	219.1907
noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the halfopen door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further	342.0887
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de <UNK> the sergeant began to laugh	583.8904

the catalans beyond a bare <UNK> wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans	282.0349
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the <UNK> and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat	680.7309
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques	97.0623

if only for the sake of m	100.2673
the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the counts approach	92.1404
dartagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract	61.7179
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first	55.3943
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself	151.3055
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror	81.6197

sinbad preceded his guest	2085.4277
thats not fair said the seaman who had saved dantès for you know more than we do what is that to you jacopo returned the captain	156.8925
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring	249.1305
after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	130.2895
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared	63.3546
the steward wished to turn to the left	79.8822
thats it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread	102.4729

alexander vi	1133.2279
you tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to fail she will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce herself she is capable of anything or everything	95.3624
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion	182.1666
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the <UNK> of the <UNK> in the blood and which might besides be accidental dartagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance	648.6839
i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches chapter	245.7238
de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience	776.4433
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow	71.7578
it was then observable that the substance was greenish	348.0167
this was to go himself to m	90.7189
from that moment he grew very guarded	130.3169
what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor	233.9399

milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat	221.3561
those were good old days never <UNK> people owe us no grudge is your honor sure i can answer for it they do not well we wont speak of it any more then and planchet took his place in dartagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed	263.3444

the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	341.6732
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	123.8982
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did add to that dartagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth and here we are at the ninth	150.8798

miladys secret dartagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kittys chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to <UNK> that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches <UNK> and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those	246.8694

the image of <UNK> and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of battle of fifty large sausages suspended from the <UNK> scarcely ten remained	1475.8071
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	223.2099
cavalcanti will bring without touching the money	452.0095
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m	448.5228
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of <UNK> his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model	217.2018
alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near <UNK> the monarchy	633.6330
a man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones	818.0286
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime	232.6788
dartagnan said the minister sitting down i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer i hope said dartagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend therefore i apply to you	81.9836
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said dartagnan	184.1299
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood	266.2783
franz i like everyone and you include me in the expression <UNK> thanks let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few	489.5360
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls <UNK> or <UNK> as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna <UNK> only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu	226.7504
cavalcantis m	406.6554
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best	168.1159
then extending his hand the old man said i thank you my son and now leave me alone yet replied carlini	97.7028
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few <UNK> with their white sails were alone visible	200.7149
louis xiii	2.2768
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left he is not a prince simply a count a count and a rich one too eh yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very <UNK> gentleman oh be easy i have no design upon your count and	145.7852
you shall have him all to yourself	233.9524
she was still exceedingly handsome	213.2269
de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult	82.0282
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant elkobbir assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your masters blood look gentlemen all these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the counts forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt alis blood	257.6022
still lingering there	18936.2441
or from your generosity my friend to so good a <UNK> as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his <UNK> <UNK> do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m	285.7359
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks <UNK> for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated	236.2010
one hours rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young mans bright anticipations and the hitherto <UNK> pleasure of <UNK> pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known <UNK> to raoul to <UNK> not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future	1205.2380
tedesco answered the cavalier <UNK> <UNK> and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went	215.1523
villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin	107.8372
the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the _pharaon_ which he reached as she rounded into la réserve basin	241.8253
dartagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots <UNK> the cloth and the curtains	920.3911
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know tis true replied dartagnan	109.0794
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	196.0861
<UNK> or nero those <UNK> those <UNK> of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for	1167.7173
what is that he inquired	21.0088
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your <UNK> have given yourself up to <UNK> and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend help cried caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally <UNK> may not die perhaps they can yet save my life your wounds are so	658.6086
far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead	295.0545
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a <UNK> at the end of twenty days increasing another <UNK> you would have taken three hundred <UNK> that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	163.4067
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not <UNK> in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream	283.8924
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m	144.2111
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos	156.5791
gentlemen good morning as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m	125.3444
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely	137.6982
debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness	167.5789
were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this <UNK> but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious	320.5272
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	158.2325
i know who it is then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord impudent fellow cried dartagnan you will get me turned off the gate groaned on its hinges and dartagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal	228.7955
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an understanding	103.9866
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately	728.8086
that very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity <UNK> to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of <UNK> success	2084.0002
dartagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	218.7574
are you superhuman	1019.1642
waiter said danglars pen ink and paper pen ink and paper muttered fernand	777.0856
m	nan
the rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis	384.1947
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy <UNK> for new nets	257.0089
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port	80.2947
forward cried dartagnan and spur for your dear lives they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward scotland	216.6393
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker his banker	69.0979
everything lies in the execution good the execution of plots is my <UNK> i know it well	622.4708
athos cried the two musketeers	47.6880
worthy fellows said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been m august rolled by in <UNK> efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old	333.5545
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	82.9080
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions	714.6221
oh now i may say so so much the better replied monte cristo as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you	68.4923
she had fled with him from her convent with your brother yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	109.9865
you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied dartagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me	98.9974
may i at least return asked morrel	114.5682
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	176.0120
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg	136.8885
good day dear dartagnan said aramis believe me i am glad to see you so am i delighted to see you said dartagnan although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to to himself my friend to himself but what makes you doubt it i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i	51.6345
had found my way into the apartment of some churchman	277.2760
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	411.5239
well said the count	6.3763
tell me now can you deny all this and who told you this fine story sire asked tréville quietly	165.1708
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible	202.1855
i was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because monsieur laporte the queens cloak bearer is her godfather and <UNK> her well monsieur asked dartagnan	504.9479
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the kings death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had wellnigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree	155.8548
at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and <UNK> from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the <UNK> adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was	809.3457
a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saintmérans that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past	538.8488
de tréville was at the moment in rather illhumor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving dartagnans response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his <UNK> double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making	219.1423
a sign to dartagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent	155.4683
this was the more so because bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecolored	638.7168
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret	179.8023
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want eh pardieu said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money	183.3449
_diable_ a pallor overspread the young mans forehead and he looked around him with anxiety	93.3940
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and <UNK>	1148.4832
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her you are right said dartagnan i will have done with her	77.7741
you will take your place in the _coupé_ to châlons	89.7564
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	357.3685
what	nan
my husband has five or six <UNK> you shall choose the best	533.6458
milady looked at this man and hesitated	64.1130
no object affects me and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you	127.2832
in june the profit amounted to	1051.8174
prison had made edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever	424.9325
mme	nan
poor edward is as much m	270.1624
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own <UNK> weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	333.1354
and the disappearance of his money how am i to justify it if i am here you are right we must go out go out	76.2737
but in what force was the enemy	191.7772
noirtier	nan
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern	109.5123
m	nan
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by <UNK> similar to those of which we have spoken	206.8288
what is to be said	23.2270
the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported	324.7299
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner	95.1350
sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that dartagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage	283.6755
on the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began <UNK>	718.6904
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with such a heart as <UNK> such a <UNK> passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times <UNK> and <UNK>	418.7311
i had often seen my noble patron <UNK> ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family <UNK>	10849.0615
he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the ironheeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged	194.4848
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other	418.9802
heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond you are right dartagnan i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me	250.4028
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors	474.8390
well be it so at length said eugénie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is i see him the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty	149.4064
by no means said dartagnan	59.5918
we left paris each with seventyfive pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure i think not monsieur unless something new should happen well a pleasant journey thanks monsieur dartagnan left m	267.8373
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again	88.7893
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions	91.2438
bonacieux	nan
touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too	192.9997
we shall wait for you dartagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him	38.6104
not at all why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there <UNK> in all about two hundred <UNK> i should certainly be arrested at the barriers	479.2901
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk	139.2027
a man of from thirtyfive to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style	255.7751
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it	155.9435
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted there was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror	315.0680
morrel attributed penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his <UNK> arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the _pharaon_ longer	305.5527
dartagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m	89.3898
although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual time	87.5720
alas said andrea sighing one cannot be completely happy in this world chapter	151.1458
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours	224.4530
the carriage stopped	60.1673
was it not agreed asked the count that not only my person but also that of my friends should be respected by you and how have i broken that treaty your excellency you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf	163.3588
pardon me dartagnan he said	19.1628
<UNK> banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants	125.8437
this point settled the duke turned to dartagnan	168.1954
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most <UNK> style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to	282.8816
another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	133.3389
well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice	307.5745
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for today she has need of the same courage and the same devotion what exclaimed dartagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise <UNK> men in short so great by merit or <UNK> she deign to cast her eyes	243.9000
on an obscure soldier anne understood this <UNK> reproach and was more moved than irritated by it	3293.9636
come reflect and decide your goodness <UNK> me monseigneur replied dartagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an <UNK> but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely dartagnan paused	429.3009
he had formed his resolution	83.7809
it was that another partook of his <UNK> another partook of his <UNK> another was to die before him lead two sheep to the butchers two oxen to the <UNK> and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will <UNK> for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy	1084.5591
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the <UNK> at auteuil he slept soundly	215.4061
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba <UNK> were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of monte cristo	510.0024
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	79.0289
then turning to <UNK> you hope the assassin will be tried no then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine yes it is no news to you added davrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject	169.9606
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal	4453.7158
then she cried <UNK> under cover of the <UNK> <UNK> striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her	1530.6910
but let us see whatever i may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure	239.6805
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great haste	59.0581
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped	304.0277
ah cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend i am a gascon said i only when i succeed the answer pleased him and he laughed	82.6286
you are now sanguinary but take care	316.2175
while the struggle between day and night lasted dantès still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	197.7107
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life	65.9443
the four friends followed ten paces behind him	67.5189
i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses	58.8135
how sir said planchet is it you eh mon dieu yes my good friend this worthy porthos has just received a sword wound and i am taking him to his country house at saint cloud oh really said planchet	126.0439
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered	202.3335
as for that benedetto who so <UNK> <UNK> his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him no far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast	375.9180
those <UNK> <UNK> are always thirsty	91484.2891
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the <UNK> i shall have made in consequence of your advice work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed	108.1287
may have fallen upon stone another upon the <UNK> or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plague stifle you and your latin said dartagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted	1977.2963
yes i see for the young man raoul said dartagnan	47.4725
i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her capital but how will you get me out of paris oh as to that you must leave it to me i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like dartagnan shook his head	115.2437
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him	71.2008
i have only two <UNK> will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even <UNK> are time and distance	3293.5583
chapter ix	3575.6558
m albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea	212.3927
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an <UNK> change took place	200.1642
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from <UNK> who fell in the square at athens with his <UNK> in his hand friquet reached councillor broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis <UNK> by his leather bag	963.1721
yes the queen and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she	63.1619
had <UNK> from monsieur des essarts	9021.9619
athos merely glanced at it	299.9756
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	211.7747
it is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a woman then all at once starting she cried my god can he have and she stopped	152.0700
take away vasiliki said my father to his palikares	535.4976
poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her greatness	788.7025
i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish	291.6622
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons	71.3804
die in peace and i said m	96.0397
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon	238.1318
oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches thou who like beings of a superior order to ourselves <UNK> understand the science of good and evil if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth if after death the soul ever	546.4795
revisit the places where we have lived and <UNK> noble heart sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the count bowed his head and clasped	498.6574
his hands together	639.7898
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place	71.6321
never have i seen you look so young so beautiful the duchess shook her head	105.6978
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say <UNK> themselves in the most awkward manner possible	477.2597
a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to no rue de la <UNK> walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise	222.3256

good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a <UNK> tavern and knocked at the door	120.1504

fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his <UNK> year at the opening of this history was now in his <UNK> his hair had turned white time and sorrow had <UNK> deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some	424.9023
particular thought or person	1743.5854
and then must not all be over	269.8804
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the <UNK>	6584.5635

when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the	355.0913
houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls	83.2348

the following morning they arrived at châlons where the counts steamboat waited for them	206.3296
she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened	84.4040
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus grimaud however did not even smile	263.3434
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	158.9461
gendarmes said the president lead in the accused at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter	142.1536

at nine oclock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word	210.8610
what does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made	127.0955
we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it	228.0650
another reigns in her name	323.8954

it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent	226.4347

the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back	303.8248
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz dépinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughters hand on <UNK> i please what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech	282.0514
m	nan
he is gone to noisy how dost thou know ah faith there was no great cunning necessary	489.7063
dartagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond	270.6014
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	163.3132
disguised as a coachman exclaimed mazarin	295.0764
danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine oh such a dreadful thing that i dont dare to tell you always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile	68.2177
i did replied the count	62.7891
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a <UNK> expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	434.6137
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination a problem my dear count for <UNK> my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear	473.4465
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	114.9995
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships	133.1971
listen sir	52.7729
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen anne looked at dartagnan anxiously	223.6798
their vows were sacred and irrevocable	1740.7601
two angelic faces	2759.1108
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing	3122.0991
what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tired parry resumed his reading	165.2466
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else they continued their route	128.3524
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you	35.7632
her mouth was small and rosy and although her <UNK> like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt	582.8062
there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes yes you are right tréville you are right then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds	137.4468
and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty cannot be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france	127.8603
two heads to royalty	1145.7445
they brought me that book	691.2650
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty say i am condemned sir if you please but you know that god who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and i myself would aid you with my prayers oh you	301.4170
are a just man cried milady throwing herself at his feet	151.2339
then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	215.0491
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word	86.7326
bravo athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	125.8976
valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m	61.4068
i have proof of it	71.1818
do you not recognize me unhappy child <UNK> silent said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for heavens sake do not speak so loud you wish to speak with me alone do you not said bertuccio	243.8647
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a	271.8241
st <UNK> and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed	242.9794
a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to <UNK> a great design	2205.3674
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and dartagnan turned to him	55.6021
and the drawers yes those at the side no the middle one yes valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	260.8486
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his <UNK> and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone	445.5651
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the <UNK> and his <UNK> rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat	834.1850
it is war said the prince	41.1974
de tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying sblood he shall not escape me this time and who asked m	303.8861
the other members silently dispersed	3467.6875
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for dartagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors	271.9918
tell me then speak you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness who are you then	166.1731
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe	216.4212
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag	2157.9167
give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas no madame answered	203.5376
de winter but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies allies said the queen shaking her head	141.8225
ah said morcerf i see you are a <UNK> for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted	203.3024
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself	172.9152
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but dartagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her	62.9214
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m	52.9258
i supplicate you i implore you on my <UNK> me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and <UNK> felton reproached himself	693.7389
adieu adieu said aramis	25.9037
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	1072.6373
she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious <UNK> or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage	316.2701
my father thought that this action had been miraculously <UNK> believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us	286.4459
i shall be with mine under the third	129.4785
ah said dartagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	90.9433
beauchamp and it is always well done sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin	76.7726
an envoy of the duke of buckingham named montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the german empire spain england and lorraine	499.8473
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	163.5181
they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	177.1146
i will take him dead thats all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	198.1932
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done dartagnan but perhaps you have been wrong dartagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him	88.7083
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the	143.4022
end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right <UNK> in <UNK> a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it <UNK> us to find it there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot	272.0845
leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its <UNK> and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	312.8594
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene	259.7167
let us go to rueil said athos	11.4744
as luigi spoke thus he left her	434.0974
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me m right dantès quite right	103.5194
chapter xi	449.4918
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself	244.6890
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him i dont call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice	292.2154
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the <UNK> of my temples because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend	312.6285
when she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arms to him and believed herself safe but carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her	141.2518
the man fell like an ox beneath the <UNK>	484.2217
de villefort no to mademoiselle valentine no to m	299.9956
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder	77.4304
m	nan
you are about to become captain at <UNK> elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone you are right you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such persons are among my	149.5489
acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you	117.0547
the storm still continued	799.5150
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince	62.2781
bonacieux took place	105.4748
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in dartagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected	168.2397
debray probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day	242.4144
like one of those drunken <UNK> in the pictures of rubens	1441.9956
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments	31.1538
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you ali bowed in token of strict obedience	216.2126
_non <UNK> do not understand was the reply	469.2823
de villefort passed on to his own room	63.9996
a cold perspiration burst from every <UNK> and his hair stood on end	740.8408
de morcerf what prince asked albert	130.2153
grimauds agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news	237.3195
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture really this is frightful stop a minute you dont know all yet	400.7310
is it not worth francs to save our fathers name from the chances of evil fortune and failure i thought so replied emmanuel but i wished to have your advice this is my <UNK> accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office this was done instantly	213.0772
the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten oclock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon	122.1684
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part	117.9795
