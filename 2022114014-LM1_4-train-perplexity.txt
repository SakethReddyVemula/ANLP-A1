there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor really said madame de villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation	3431.6047
well _pardieu_ there is yours my dear friend replied dartagnan	1503.2588
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon	2183.0942
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him	2855.4304
does your excellency wish me to accompany him no the coachman ali and baptistin will go the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars	839.1008

if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter	1465.2408
that is all i had to say to you and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady	951.7148

come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion but a humpbacked general under the cuirass the hump will not be seen	2116.6167
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful	729.7980
why i was here only ten or twelve days ago	18346.1309
nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself	937.9871
passing alongside one of them dartagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meungthe same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom dartagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her	1515.2969
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his	736.5477
hardly had dartagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication	1451.7178
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired	1690.4850
but as i cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance	1468.9912
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me	817.4214
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it	1132.7104
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a curate	1125.9501
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others	3474.2681
they arrived at the appointed spot	33978.5625
and her mother madame de saintremy have they yet told her of it no sir madame de saintremy is at blois with the duchess of orleans	1439.6150
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin	1283.0806
morrel had to pay within half an hour francs	11008.1240
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an underjailer illclothed and of sullen appearance	4110.1377
planchet stopped short staring at dartagnan	1361.5677
i have an idea which i will explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation	924.3318
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman	2233.6982
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmers son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback	1608.1001
but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king the queen remained silent	1023.6012
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate	578.0140

i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin	1867.4454
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late the gale had given way	6402.3384
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project	785.0146
dartagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle	3257.3611
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure	511.4539
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another	1590.5927
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness	513.1539
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten	1372.3990
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth	1348.7802
monsieur du vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money	6745.3613
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition	1318.0007
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	1819.7701
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me i pardon you monseigneur said bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry	2303.0203

she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	1414.1904
why you must have lost your senses whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us	1245.2462
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire	985.0868
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man	1774.9489
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	2771.6350
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced	3571.5830

i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that goodnature of which your eminence speaks	1126.4607
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes because you do not love me madame if you loved me you would view all this otherwise	1014.4724

i told you so exclaimed madame de villefort	2211.0176

de trévilles tone of voice that he was very angry about something	2293.3669
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women	2101.4153
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice miladys condescension	3392.7222
impossible go on go on my dear fellow said dartagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each you are laughing at me and want to try me said dartagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the _iliad_	1556.5563
de morcerf said the president as he unsealed the letter and the count began his defence i assure you albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner	1239.3379
the three valets passed without accident	11099.9443
on the landing dartagnan blushed in the antechamber he trembled	2412.0742
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade	793.0125
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper	2029.3375

madame said he if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel sir	2213.6516
dartagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	3969.7485
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth	5568.1694
that is all very simple you had business in england monseigneur said dartagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or elsewherethat concerns nobody	3825.2209
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand	1945.2511

one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle there was no one like him for that and now replied dartagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	1076.7893
the worthy shipowner knew from penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him	3406.5400
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god	975.8844

monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	1502.5795
when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rosecolored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized	1863.0864
whom do i see yonder where in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a cloak it is he cried dartagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man	945.3573
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said andrea	779.1066
i cannot reconcile myself to this ideait would madden me	2889.6721
in two or three hours thought dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm	1921.0048
what could explain athoss having reentered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table	2189.8105
ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself alas yes murmured de winter	2272.0081
yes i will accompany you but did you not read that i must be alone said julie	523.4824
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more halfpistoles in any way perhaps replied dartagnan	2307.2874
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically and why her rather than another because a mistress is one of the cardinals favorite means he has not one that is more expeditious	1135.3146
monsieur dherblay she added turning toward aramis will you be my servant once more this evening how can you doubt it replied aramis this evening tomorrow always command me i will then	1657.9730
spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will	1473.6779
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything _ma foi_ you frighten me	1096.1605
oh exclaimed morrel why do they not come	1298.3883
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger	2066.6577
porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street	2134.0020
this was to go himself to m	131.5895
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	1920.8169
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rentas i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux replied dartagnan trust me i am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct and if as i told you i can be of any service to you i believe you monsieur i believe you and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you finish then what you were about to say the citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to dartagnan	867.5653
alas said davrigny she is indeed dead poor child m yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised	6193.0151
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the _pharaon_ yes and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl yes now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things	1371.1301
ah count said he his father loves him so much do not speak to me of that said monte cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed i will make him suffer morrel amazed let fall monte cristos hand	1456.5604
morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the cloverfield where his cabriolet was still waiting for him	979.4769
but why have two of each sort asked danglars	68652.4609
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself	912.6686
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account how was that how	858.6849
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it what do you mean sir inquired raoul	1917.0380
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	2103.5186
where is the prisoner said a voice	471.0465
i told you this i am now grieved i have kept my word	1559.0195
i have extricated you from misery felton i have caused you to be named lieutenant i once saved your life you know on what occasion	1924.9916
i hate the englishthey are coarse like every nation that swills beer would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort	1693.4274
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said dartagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration	1072.0994
dartagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table	2755.9668
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydée your sisterlet her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the counts voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo turned around haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement	1746.4845
what are you doing cried kitty	83129.7891
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears	1155.0385
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	1189.8903
refer to your papers you are not busoniyou are not monte cristo	679.1083
oh cried aramis do you see count yes said athos	1240.7889
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon	1819.1445
no said morrel is someone dead in his house the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness	2473.5103
if only we two arrive said dartagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in number that is true said porthos and he spurred his courser on	1051.1902
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinals party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queenmother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m	2187.7324
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure	1253.1345
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering	2843.1848
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips	1537.2787
you were no stranger to me for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted	1048.5795
they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of braccianos ball to which all rome was invited	1392.2675
in the meanwhile the promises of m	127.1638
well bazin said dartagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	2436.3525
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement	13190.6895
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra	3515.1814
franz dépinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart	1226.7451
come come dearest valentine confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust m it is true said valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend but still you acted from motives of selfinterest my dear maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us	1364.3259
and whatever might beconsidering the violent character of miladythe danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her	3081.3528
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages	1767.8064
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste of course i have well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name	1586.9266
go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime henry iv whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed ah madame madame how little you know me mon dieu but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinals numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of de winter who stood apart in isolation	2522.5364
dartagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the night	2373.5454
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared	2283.4946
the guards under the command of m	119.2687
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene	966.4822
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room	1802.4369
danglars alone was content and joyoushe had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the _pharaon_ secure	2501.6042
ah _pardieu_ is that you said porthos to dartagnan	302.3793
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least	1086.8074
now i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm	1324.5549
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy	2888.5493
he remained there all night not knowing where he was	770.7916
by the female side i believe said the procurator maliciously	2986.0112
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	3628.8965
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject	3358.6492
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saintgermain	3134.0496
yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are wretch cried dartagnan speak quickly who employed you to assassinate me a woman whom i dont know but who is called milady but if you dont know this woman how do you know her name my comrade knows her and called her so	1232.5627
as soon as he arrives inform me	2763.2239
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act	3466.4971
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad	1509.8708
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest	923.1878
by no means it really seems to me very curious yes indeed	3840.9946
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man	2681.8914
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	1647.7996
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	2381.2371
monsieur the cardinal cried the stupefied musketeer	15114.4053
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts daughter	1452.3534
look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to dartagnan the scratch he had remembered	633.4218
the coachman stooped down for his orders	2410.7061
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	864.1777
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	824.3729
dartagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error	702.2228
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so longit will happen one day or the other m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability _incognito_ the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice	1173.8914
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat	6405.3857
oh let us speak frankly continued louvieres and act in a straightforward manner	3867.8135
for the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the mediterranean	1477.0962
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	1168.5468
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me	812.3940
i suppose you mean continued dartagnan	282.4693
it will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said this block is very low is there no other to be had it is the usual block answered the man in the mask	709.7507
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture	1384.9132
what planchet is monsieur dartagnan here here i am my friend dear athos cried dartagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation	2974.1953
de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty m	759.3574
ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready as he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying _al suo commodo_ the two young men arose and entered the breakfastroom	1733.7429
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty	4979.3511
he threw himself upon it and fell asleep	5604.5142
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tigercat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers	1550.2335
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years	1202.0056
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you i will answer for lord de winter as for myself dunce cried milady dunce who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after gods own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument	1687.0537
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him	2198.3540
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength	2091.1943
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other	856.0570
_se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere	22434.1172
as they were going down dartagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader	1441.9103
they singlet them pay the piper	36871.4922
the approach was not such as to prepossess peoplean illsmelling dark passage a staircase halflighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet	3802.4453
at last we are off exclaimed porthos	11690.6504
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey	2076.5667
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	1173.4666
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust	3119.9441
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well	904.7297
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord	703.8359
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king	652.6332
de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips	2119.4607
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased	5729.8809
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court	2313.2571
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration	2362.5552
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write	1755.7128
this doctor has a niece continued aramis	8837.0977
now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso and as i now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine thats my point for sport	976.1855
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors	4868.3716
without doubt aramis is one of my best friends aramis who is he come come you wont tell me you dont know aramis this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced it is the first time then that you ever went to that house undoubtedly and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man no by a musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the world	683.3033
it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless no that his style of writing is very good this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out albert laughed	2214.6167
but said morrel the culpritthe murdererthe assassin do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said villefort	4093.1650
at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down	3159.2991
is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago certainly not longer well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week	3643.4783
listen my dear girl said dartagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or other	1537.3329
the prince read as he hastened on	6189.3721
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis	2031.2612
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him	2925.4402
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	3129.9009
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friends chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself againthat is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men	1600.7373
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m	1582.5205
dartagnan returned to change his workmans clothes for his chestnutcolored suit and porthos to put on his red doublet	3150.0479
i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal	1026.1434
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome with pleasure there was a cry of shut up from the audience	760.5329
where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i dont know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby	1133.6615

the worthy sergeant had recognized the ministers secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp	2557.6331
hes not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms hes not going on a message for he goes secretly	4041.4873
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare	1081.6451
the prisoner glanced at the windowsthey were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither	1718.5831
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied dartagnan	799.0553
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence	2185.5898
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	1469.8440
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly	1351.1123
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow	1612.3237
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed	1390.6671
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty	1727.1442
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you	1370.5863
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy father and mercédès come said the abbé closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtierhis arrival at marseilles and interview with his fatherhis affection for mercédès and their nuptual feasthis arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château dif from this point everything was a blank to dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	1619.7909
you can see it in his eye	849.5316
we have no time now for suspicions said athos	1049.4613

besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which _la jeune amélie_ replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come	1746.9401
at these words he gave me a ring	722.8149
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and illbred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished	794.9297
the sailors looked at one another	4734.9238
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frockcoat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travellingcap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes	2100.8762
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to france for a thousand pistoles said the captain	964.6935
in gods name answer me he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	1705.4050
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight	1644.9388
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils	2210.8647
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled	3589.4929
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine danglars bit his lips	2041.5581
listen it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duke of buckingham it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off it was you who in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to monsieur dartagnan it was you who believing that de wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends	1137.3976
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money	1276.3311
get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	1108.5826
i imagined it must be said morrel	1419.7748
there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal from harlequin even to pantaloon chevalier chevalier said athos	7369.1240
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him	740.9672
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist	722.4986
look fernand your eyes are better than mine	15311.8174
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine	4444.0762
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect	1075.0045
but this year continued the horticulturist ill take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe monte cristo had seen enough	2377.7048
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	1463.1135
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	1225.6692
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right dont be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal	2185.5117
this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions the public astonishment had reached its height	1191.9897
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	3272.7712
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls heart	2796.2371
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos	716.5049
de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you none on the contrary he was very kind to me i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you entirely that is well wait patiently then dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnestly	1340.7290
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities	2645.0354
ali returned a sign in the negative	768.5397
well well dandré said louis xviii blacas is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurpers conversion the minister of police bowed	4891.1094
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	1364.8810
take courage vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided	1778.2789
these bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee la ramee came into the room	7883.9980
on then on those who love me follow me and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free free free chapter xxiv	2324.2896
have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours good answered harrison	2951.2822
he is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart	1096.9836
he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling	7864.6987
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	22769.8301
two royal pages were playing with him	146.0487
he gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in france	798.7121
do you wish for a notary asked villefort	15679.9648
i was most anxious to see you but it must have vexed m	811.8248
he would no longer be alone	38315.5742
go dartagnan go grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon a half hour afterward dartagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident	3119.5811
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead you make me tremble said the young girl	3130.9607
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going	1053.0760
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated	1772.9872
ah good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her	792.8476
all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished	2236.9597
i am afraid for the kings safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right reassure yourself madame i will answer for the kings safety as he left the queens presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal	2497.1313
you have no enemy herethere is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand	1577.6028
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness	1167.7909
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery	1143.9430
cavalcantis father will be gone but the son will be here will you invite young m	671.7698
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical	1954.8928
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively	1689.3906
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	1166.8824
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m	1065.3324
the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	2458.6785
m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	2010.2286
danglars i ask you only how your engagement stands	15022.0908
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	5009.9165
why an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	2520.0059
yes replied albert raising his voice	6289.3770
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice	2381.8582
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	3195.5522
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach	1980.0361
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again	3179.6655
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	1404.6974
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly the conduct is infamously violent do you know that monsieur the king commands it madame excuse me i will not suffer it no no i would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise	1409.0459
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second	1158.6201
albert beauchamp and châteaurenaud remained alone	14335.8203
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief	2313.9985
i cannot make you share the fate i have planned for myself	1025.7192
his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency	3274.0354
there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter	3151.1956
has not your excellency heard that the french _chargé daffaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri oh yes i heard that well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at portoferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered	2538.6516
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m	1808.8815
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind	1035.6404
adieu then and be of good courage said athos	3906.3997
the races like the _moccoli_ are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	642.1750
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person	938.2349
they walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal march	1642.3125
de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it	1031.4951
you can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that i have passed with you	594.9403
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated	912.1244
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker	6640.0498
well what do you wish me to do for you said beauchamp mildly	371.9429
have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustainednothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood m what do you say said the count francs	1374.5334
athos and dartagnan watched their approach from the window	1365.0156
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes who then urged you to write	1731.6855
i also have made my preparations this morning oh heavens yes said aramis	3915.2576
she is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but youif you will do her the honor to address a word to her that is sufficient my lord i have sworn and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence	1115.3387
we must let monsieur de beaufort come in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de condé had arrived	2192.5020
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	1217.7344
he remained there some time alone	29185.7539
are you ready sir he said at last	395.5803
i will continue then resumed aramis	2885.0391
tis not too warm to walk resumed dartagnan	4921.0112
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase	3127.7166
yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit	2314.3779
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt	2786.7266
charlotte backson comtesse de la fère milady de winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven	4626.3774
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand	1819.8646
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door	1680.5831
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa	1884.5598
what is there then behind this wall	2600.4619
edmond resigned the lugger to the masters care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment	1178.2195
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous you are right madame and i will not finish but it was my husband who would not hear of lending madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory the procurators wife uttered a groan	1196.9581
now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart the count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than mercédès	1059.9204
at ten oclock the next day they met again	6261.9722
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question what is it sir you are fond of gardening passionately and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it you live badly on your thousand francs badly enough but yet i do live yes but you have a wretchedly small garden true the garden is not large and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything ah they are my scourges tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him then what would happen i could not repeat the signals and then not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined how much a hundred francs the tenth of your incomethat would be fine work ah said the man	1474.8251
then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle	2129.3994
but why do you ask i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know	394.6125
a woman could go up a ladder like that aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but dartagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity	1697.3134
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	1341.9557
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her	970.0461
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard	2611.2798
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel at the hotel of said porthos by my faithnor do i remember it either it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain alas sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	1192.4418
and dauphiné sir inquired the king of villefort	1954.4921
does your honor want a horse asked mousqueton	47955.5781
ready said he with his usual curtness	132729.8438
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son	1242.2311
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money	4020.5706
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m	2103.0110
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to gain and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil that of bracieux in the soissonais and that of pierrefonds in the valois	1919.3887
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance	1989.3655
emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are executed at least we shall see each other again m	2051.6399
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	1513.1842
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility	2338.3318
captivity the third day chapter lv	48011.0391
one may see that you love your family madame coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost tragic	2621.3787
at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man	684.4767
give your orders and we will execute them then open the door directly peppino obeyed	4498.6147
at a quarter to six oclock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace	3904.4592
very well my lord it shall be so dartagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarins flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness	3192.4302
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone	4067.5098
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness	1348.7313
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	2046.4996
to the sloop said felton and row quickly the four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it	2494.8259
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream	1973.9934
no this is his blood where were you then where you left meunder the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all	714.5414
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face	3953.8005
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there wont be any parliament at all and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it	1198.9803
de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor	1925.4030
whereupon grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	1494.9233
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarinimpossible an italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves	1920.8077
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and dartagnan turned to him	1038.9519
the pistol fell from his hands	12607.3428
the blow was sped by dartagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	3415.1145
dartagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life	1995.5533
one of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all three	4248.3389
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place	2362.0188
the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy	604.3165
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die	1015.0322
with one of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet fifty feet responded dantès almost terrified	2717.4475
i once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said i shall do but i have done so and so that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil darker and more silent even than the bastile	1043.6908
did you know that no monseigneur	41342.1055
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him	1013.4005
at the end of the dinner he entered in person	4808.9512
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of men	1586.1489
te deum for the victory of lens	1869.1060
you talk of sacrilege why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude	839.4565
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbé	1375.5294
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	1351.9147
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor	1344.0524
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	2393.1926
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée	1039.6620
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold	3111.3008
lord how i have eaten m	976.2582
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why	848.6737
no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will alas murmured edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile	1739.7369
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free	3995.1416
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face	761.8817
how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation	1443.0541
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied dartagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia	2172.7393
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried valentine	1321.3724
good news good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout	847.8497
marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hatfontrailles with his arm in a slingwounded guardshorses bleeding eh then what are the sentinels about	2738.7136
the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word	1489.3075
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself	1612.2185
but where is franz in the first carriage with m	688.8662

de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire	1130.0028

lord de winter came toward five oclock in the evening	1576.4252

lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	936.0091
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre	960.0472
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone yes said dartagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison him good god to imprison him monseigneur	1825.9492
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre	1794.3623

whilst they pursue him the king might escape it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him what do you think of this counsel winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him	1332.7410
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	3187.9883
well it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue i remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the comte de la fere your father asked de guiche	2189.4387
the counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	4813.9712
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of dartagnan who however placed himself between him and them	1375.1924
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne	1701.8745
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	1817.6541
tell them to take arms to come here and to run ah i remember athos is at monsieur de trévilles but where are you going monsieur where are you going i am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried dartagnan	828.8917
milady looked at this man and hesitated	1764.7179
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation	1930.8826
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head	687.2906
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	998.7125
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	1077.6199
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement	7031.0435
alas i have them no longer how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son well let us see said mazarin isnt there still time to repair the evil	2305.5740

monsieur said the cardinal are you a dartagnan from béarn yes monseigneur replied the young man	1514.2762
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg	2582.8086
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life	2679.7642
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes he must have one said athos	1248.6329
and we say proud as a gascon replied dartagnan	1323.0299
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other	1042.2347

there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling	2827.3250
it was said that madame de longueville for whom the prince had more than a brothers affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet	1846.4329
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks	1924.1547
danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the door	818.0613
adieu my kind friends emmanueljuliefarewell how farewell exclaimed julie do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite at least i advised him to do so i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner	2875.9299
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned youis that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	1116.1006
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet	1220.3286
this voice was that of my father	1609.8700
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory	4974.7041
mazarin did not even turn around	8578.1904
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	2524.1704

i think nothing i quote a fact that is all	253.1390

that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself	4043.2952
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the bankers daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise darmilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company	2421.0818
you do not understand asked felton	12820.7881
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him	1011.6749
taste that fowl and those fish	35359.6172

a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	1461.6227

and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not yes and it was they who told you something which made you angry	911.2527
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	1263.0004
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited	8270.2588
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room	906.6758
besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience you see it is not my fault and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girlsone fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar	2345.4419
give me your arm and let us go very well let us go said caderousse but i dont want your arm at all	2080.8218
oh no said kitty it is not me you love it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the _soubrette_	1185.2847
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully	8587.1523
de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than raoul who was only fifteen	3310.0234

the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	1465.3030

one might believe the queen was about to speak	1013.6649
i understand he said you confess but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last moment extorted when the crime cannot be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty the punishment exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur	2172.2317

and now said athos what is to be done	415.5074
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue	6334.0767
i shall be with mine under the third	2425.3062
but contrary to all expectation when the st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	1931.6138
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him	1318.3345
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this then turning to dartagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received	1261.5034

but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end	1302.7903
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that dartagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place	1944.4581

the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection	1637.3386

on the staircase he met athos and porthos who were coming to see him	808.5934

do you suppose that the real _savant_ addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual	9908.3652
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing	1291.2103

your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning	2449.2751

the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination	2087.2244
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound ah hell come round thought dartagnan thats not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to dartagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics	1864.8542

as dartagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m	1453.9146

they understood then from the few words which escaped from dartagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him dartagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way	1232.7949

monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze	1837.1316
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures	4697.9463
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water	4436.6318
goodmorning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m	1656.4550

i cannot cry at my age they say that we have no more tearsstill i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping	1001.0139
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which dartagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence	1969.1292
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and miladys every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other thats exactly the reason i wont go said dartagnan	1540.0028
the feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pistoles	3959.2227
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two oclock	2733.6123
no but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for instance my dear little love in my country the ladies do without chambermaids	1553.1577
dartagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passersby and he restrained himself	2100.4404
no madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you m yes i do remember replied the countess	564.7525
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure it is a wound that confines him to his bed ah and a master stroke too i assure you	1542.6127
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it	720.5626

at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos	965.4335
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace	231.4313
he came toward teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening	2273.3496
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result	2613.3823
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going on	1408.6273
dont think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you come step in said the young man	1377.1715
what were you doing on that armchair asked he	2070.5630
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	1682.7738
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded	1872.9567
mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions	1193.6614
as for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him	1644.4816
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	1023.7281
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor	6230.2051
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this door	1549.7502
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	6988.8999
although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a steppingstone	641.9249
dartagnan did not know london he did not know a word of english but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the dukes hôtel	653.3633
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing	1659.6847
without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it	1022.8718
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority yet jacopo reached him first	3388.1760
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise and the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure	998.0184
at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	12077.8672
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him	1453.6996
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nîmes	1451.4900
it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin	1662.7780
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased	2682.3032
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget	1881.5464
how did the honor or disgrace of m	2155.7937
without a blush men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing	1282.0806

i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	2051.6018
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken	1980.0975
night came and at ten oclock they anchored	7286.7031
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	1930.4094
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape	1775.0106
such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert and the man in the little blue cloak and will that be the first time you ever took that journey yes it will	1110.8685
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that _ventrebleu_ cried dartagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one	921.8857
thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province	1814.0918
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound	4338.1040
tis raoul who has come back said athos and we can now hear how the poor child is in fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and dartagnan	1284.1309
three months afterwards a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me away	2096.4529
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste	2179.4082

dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort	2196.5925
then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	3588.5483
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m	4221.4048
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known	5249.1108
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot the prisoner was led away	1411.0710
it was an ambuscade shouted dartagnan	609.0118
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah mon dieu my dear monsieur de rochefort do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety	1864.2052

he is very susceptible bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself true	4115.6055
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil _rue du helder on the_ _st may halfpast ten_ chapter	2176.0664

they explained what had occurred that evening	1433.3831
debray told meapropos what has become of him	477.8607

parry who accompanied him stood behind him	1258.3379
hold your tongue stupid fellow said dartagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury	2226.9460
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to dartagnan	932.8776
you are coming to sup with me are you not	141.8712

have i by any means displeased you	2081.4788
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity	6029.9814
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot	3121.9709

m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event	3456.0037

that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	3688.2375
what do you say said louise	101340.1016
spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate _à latere_ who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him spada set out about two oclock to san pierdarena	2258.2109

no doubt my boy no doubt	160548.7500
dartagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinals letter it was however merely a letter of introduction	2118.6868
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by dartagnans inventive imagination	1496.4817
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs deau cest bien prouvé par le déluge you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand	2149.1470
if you deprive me of that take away my life also we are forbidden to shed your blood and by whom are you forbidden by him we obey you do then obey someone yes a chief i thought you said you were the chief so i am of these men but there is another over me and did your superior order you to treat me in this way yes but my purse will be exhausted probably come said danglars will you take a million no two millionsthreefour	1178.9271

this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu	2335.4927
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my suicide	1381.4518
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	2580.2102
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	3330.3770
danglars informed you of the ceremony oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety well said monte cristo you are fortunate m	1524.1500

good day dear dartagnan said aramis believe me i am glad to see you so am i delighted to see you said dartagnan although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to to himself my friend to himself but what makes you doubt it i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman	607.3211
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	2780.5715
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville i did go there well she was no longer there but she had left her new address where was she guess i give you a thousand chances how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight	1489.4701

morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow	1419.5718

he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future	1124.9095
her ladiesthat is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sensehad just brought into her dressingroom the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	3621.7708
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other	420.7950
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	3622.2441
albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position	3302.1570

come come murmured dartagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort	1114.3521
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there yes youre right replied the companion	2114.4116
she had still her nymphlike form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with anne of austria over the moat of the tuileries in	1309.6710

my daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion	1257.4316

dartagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was	1294.9370

in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	1796.0144

yes monsieur afraid of being heard why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips what the devil makes you think of bonacieux monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will because you are a coward planchet monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a virtue and you are very virtuous are you not planchet monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder	1652.2788

the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	3783.4763
carriages now arrived in crowds those of the marechal de villeroy guitant villequier and comminges came into the line	4545.3965

then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss	2807.4009
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death	4940.1538

nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you m noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	1414.5796

it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	1895.8073
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	1313.3927
albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert	1745.6785

oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos	863.1765
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly	2764.9307
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale	3409.2407
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	1614.3431

de tréville for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty no monsieur i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friendof the cardinal his eminence is not his holiness sire what do you mean by that monsieur that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals you mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me	857.5409

i think i have killed the insolent fellow	3879.3872
are you fond of traveling my life has been passed on the high road would anything retain you particularly in paris nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris very well	1925.8243

i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins poisondeath exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death	2119.1201
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting	3773.9016
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more seriousminded companion would have taken weeks to effect	2410.0371
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy some i shall displease others	3315.4607
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled philosophy m	2579.7415
it is i who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me to what do you refer said monte cristo with wellfeigned interest	1385.3530
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness	1821.4994
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself	843.0351
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist	1135.0488
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him	1890.0260
why did you talk of a regiment athos	1581.5903
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch	1588.0682
now if i die say to dartagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me	276.7607
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	684.0845
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out	527.8261
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	1558.8098
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title	1514.1925

i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends	1327.0400
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank	831.3351
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate dartagnan drew up his request and m	1400.8198
now that i have the word of athos i can set out dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	1930.2225
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of dartagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late dartagnan had already recognized mme	2601.8447
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookerythat is the worst in the world	1248.0948
ho there champenois here it is eleven oclock	2769.9717
do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king	1888.5413
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	2690.2937
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier	4824.6387
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	555.0925
the conversation took a cheerful turn	19367.9727
this treasure exists dantès and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will	509.3487
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity oh said andrea my fathers old servant	6489.9639
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear	1188.2511
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure	838.7036
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind dartagnan	1538.5715
_one_ said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death	1997.0708
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart	1951.5530
aramis smiled as one who hopes	8993.5273
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice	3886.8567
dartagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool	1928.7781
look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated roof very well said the gentleman	1854.3739
the devil my dear aramis said dartagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them you are mistaken friend dartagnan said aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in onesyllable verse which i began yonder ah indeed said dartagnan	1300.5477
why this very morning in my rooms he made his _entrée_ amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting châteaurenaud and what do you suppose is the counts age inquired mercédès evidently attaching great importance to this question	3152.2085
good luck to you the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at la canebière	2577.1360
when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man	1072.6123
now what is it they want to know	1263.7642
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect	1066.5386
things passed as on the night before	33610.7344
yes i i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment	3536.8809
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie	651.4085
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	3610.8657
let him find it out if he can we can find out his well thats all very sensible athos said dartagnan	1382.1127
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but dartagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis	2588.6912
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament	945.9480
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily	2769.4419
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse	1309.7622
this itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up	3910.8391
dartagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for	4085.7356
well then to my health although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his hands then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes	1121.7321

this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked beauchamp	1152.2643
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled	7598.2681
_a propos_ monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger	1837.0544
and _morbleu_ why do you not go yourself	1719.0011

count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without valentine the earth is desolate i have told you to hope said the count	2001.3348
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have donei inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	993.4655
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	1215.9188
have i not been there once yes but at that period we were not at war	1219.1072
they were thus perpetually employedfaria that he might not see himself grow old dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night	2632.5447
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass what	2083.4121
they are no doubt both curious and interesting yes yes but let us go	3390.3513
this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat	1792.9092
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed	2097.3308
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him	5228.3477
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs you guess well i know something of diamonds i have had some you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	2053.2441

he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried	1663.1697
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son	1266.0422
she has near her a certain laporte who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal	919.6689
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed	1378.9515
i am lost murmured she i am lost i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons	1286.6714
athos made him a sign to go to dartagnans residence and bring back some clothes	4063.3264
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me	1365.6888
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny	3930.4465
a moment after caderousses face appeared at the grating in the door	557.8273
but dartagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	4854.0000

how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head	847.8967
nevertheless dartagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him	2996.9548
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts	2250.7708

the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes there is something in what you have just said said beauchamp laughing	1369.2511

was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	2211.2991

this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned	1889.4817

he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future	624.1656
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	1296.5509
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	2434.4666
morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair	1431.9635
he must be the shah of persia travelling _incog_ have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m	2392.1829
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerfs	2047.1526
ah if i knew sblood messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you i am sure of itthey would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step	2087.6445
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened	6849.3574
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	3085.5020
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor	1650.1599
at all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me	1357.1062
the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for no thank you	2217.3884
did you pass through the corso yes well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross	3856.5869
the young woman hastened to meet him	1586.2957
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall	2245.0159
how sir she cried as dartagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crimeto give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me	1852.5984
de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne	1139.6130
what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsars _commentaries_ and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six oclock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankers at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist	3063.4121
franz the eyes repeated several times no no no then you are vexed with the engagement yes well listen said valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck i am vexed too for i do not love m	2213.5894
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon	1514.3672
acknowledge it beauchamp your courage cannot be doubted not so murmured the journalist on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips	2722.9094
for my part said dartagnan i say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle executioner as you were of king charles incendiary i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer ill stave your wicked head in with this oar dartagnan dartagnan cried athos my son i entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him	1519.6108
i was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just now and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	1134.0508
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle	2796.6345
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you alberts freedom what influence can i possibly have over a bandit have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten what is that have you not saved peppinos life well well said the count who told you that no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant	1309.6367
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks where can i sleep on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you likewe can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition	1746.6519
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	2091.1665
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st paul or of the place de grêve it was at the traitors cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him	1317.1947
tomorrow morning dartagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him	2881.4316
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left m	1273.0513
the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled	3367.9092
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m	3278.0471
diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel i confess i prefer the convent of noisy athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter	1604.1697
when you wish to obtain some concession from a mans selflove you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it i believe you are right i am glad of it then i will go alone go but you would do better still by not going at all that is impossible do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you why perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons well i will have franz and châteaurenaud they will be the very men for it do so then but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing that too is impossible what a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything you are rightthat is the principle on which i wish to act we will say no more about it then	894.7703
they knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself	2044.0800
we have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him porthos is wounded then i cannot tell you monsieur what you cannot tell me	668.9521
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one i admit but very necessaryhave you any money something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoula young man must live respectably	2104.4485
ay said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan i have none said athos but dartagnan will discover one dartagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded	1230.0504
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by selflove but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment	2188.0945
it was evident that he shared his masters apprehensions	17952.6016
amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos	1300.8275
certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real innocence	2502.2280
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders	1830.0277
the man was caderoussehe was pale and his shirt was all bloody	2160.6616
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind	1863.2312
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old yes but i could give him the orderi guitantand i preferred to give it to you guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier	2222.4736
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand	2231.4795
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner	1199.7729
you cannot for a moment imagine dartagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted dartagnan	3241.0403
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly dartagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	2031.3890
dartagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return	1761.6550
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready	1257.5929
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself	1256.2869
morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow	6500.6743
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe	1638.3180
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence the jury took their seats m	1620.9769

have you answered the question i put to you on entering the roomwhere do you keep the poison you generally use madame madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other	1919.9113
sure of what that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself what lord ruthven do you mean why our lord ruthventhe vampire of the salle argentina is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris to be surewhy not and you visit himmeet him at your own house and elsewhere i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m	1436.2217
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	728.6081
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak	3007.6519
be it then as you desire	62326.5039
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him	354.4000
dartagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scrupleon the contrary thanking his majesty greatly	5216.5786
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	2297.1023

the lady with the red cushion produced a great effectfor she was very handsomeupon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon dartagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady	1595.8467

you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand	1299.3422
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends	1282.1931

he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped	5514.2261
now gascons are always poor are they not sire i can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your father which is to say that the gascons made a king of me myself seeing that i am my fathers son is it not tréville	1052.8311
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse	1514.0199
better study a little common prudence	33848.4141
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another	2410.4128
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it	923.6911
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter xix	1534.1196
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	13282.1191

yes milady replied athos the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit	1577.7638
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	2075.2480
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached	1071.3993
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much you have rightly guessed madame replied the count	1194.8442
the cemetery of the château dif on the bed at full length and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was farias last windingsheeta windingsheet which as the turnkey said cost so little	3476.6113
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	1128.4913
dartagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door	2446.7864
in fact at halfpast eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawingrooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen	1553.2777
i do not recollect it said haydée	2490.2988
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	1215.9988
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	3311.8455
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief	2381.3870

but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris when do you propose going thither have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties	1374.6671
dépinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	11854.9160
i would almost answer for planchet well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice why good god you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question	1808.9324
the gascon is the devil cried athos nothing escapes him the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis	924.7920
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner rapid as had been villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	1574.6582
thanks to the garden we yet can flee i have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late mme	2616.7566
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him	1320.0146

no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and dartagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever	3526.2783
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château dif and the tower of planier	2857.8823

why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party	2442.2195
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentines death	995.9704

major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence continued monte cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed	2855.4180
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate possibly and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action it is not for me to judge	845.7839

where are you come from sir	1775.0631
m are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile	18810.6465
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him but men are changed by events there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine	1265.5197
by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant dantès saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves	3149.3750
have you wanted money father i want nothing now that i have you said the old man	326.8752
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father	2065.7288
we can go to brussels liège aixlachapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg	4826.5391

dartagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly	1144.0035
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert	32161.8184
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world	586.3026
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose	970.7518
he had tried his strength to the utmost	225.5683
well said the count you do not get out m	1260.1525
well what have you to say	2939.7454
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the antechamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him	1593.2175
i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me	656.9644
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	1207.2852
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil the stewards emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village	2087.2065
they had only halberds before now they have muskets	2156.6956
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards well provided you replace your pistols in your belt willingly and dartagnan set the example	3192.1562
the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres one above the other and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes like those which we see on the faces of the dead	1444.8629
ah _pardieu_ said he rising you come in the nick of time gentlemen	510.6193
what are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder	1820.2318
when in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held secret	2964.0457
i shall kill himi cannot help it	3605.2400
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me then today madame oh today i am no further than gratitude ah you are too charming said dartagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love no i use your generosity thats all	2367.8005
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	3283.0903
very pretty but to the great astonishment of dartagnan the shutter remained closed	3179.0137
my dear dartagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn my faith said dartagnan with great pleasure	1767.5543
meanwhile let us sit down and eat caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor	3567.5762
felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers	990.1748
who is there answered the voice of her he sought	718.8279
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé	4622.9595
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat	613.5270
davrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m	443.6672
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity and what do you mean to do to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours and what is your excellencys project just this	1570.2704
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him	1358.0986
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day	2707.8020
the door opened and dartagnan went into the chamber	3318.2632
ods bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up dartagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little and why dartagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis	1294.6771
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	3544.6641
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary m	2024.3882
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room	3620.1616
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brotherinlaw monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers monseigneur is correctly informed said dartagnan	1659.2202
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh	1087.5835
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne what would you have	1414.0718
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted and is that allis that all replied buckingham impatiently	848.7214
his words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more no embellishments no embroidery no arabesques	2862.6572
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited	1471.3186
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish ityou are inflexible	9895.9854
milady is fair you say she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ah my poor dartagnan said athos	4478.7778
let us see i have told you	3553.2778
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtuesdont you think so	1876.6864
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion	1202.2957
you cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement	1580.7437
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made the counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater	1844.1874
i shall find many men as able as you are i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort	746.6021
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house	4459.6958
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	261.4225
i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me	1972.9799
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs	3032.4382
i have no enmity against m	924.8987
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m	2196.5559
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm	808.9089
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	2591.2092
discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france	6010.5015
you would have done what i did mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength	2537.3882
hold continued dartagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins	3107.2710
certainly said monte cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise i would not fight with m	2021.7267
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	3407.9697
god has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept	729.8244
only that there may be no delay i shall borrow one of your horses certainly all the four are at your service oh i need only one of them for the time being shall we take our valets yes you may as well take mousqueton	1494.6183
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers	4001.9331
at length i heard the wellknown noise of the door which opened and shut i heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed haste haste said felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten lead then continued milady then i collected all my strength i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck	1877.3147
do you remember how he cried on dartagnan on i am taken	607.3645
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean did i say dead or alive replied mazarin	1790.1917
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night	1586.7050
policar morrel who served under the _other_ government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon	1871.3774
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate	2874.8660
four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	475.6269
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat	606.3135
but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp i yes you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine ah yes so i was	1974.2314
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow	12757.7061
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to dartagnans deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville	1690.5745
at length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	957.8071
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fatewhich would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an endone of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young mans shoulder	1600.3862
i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin	1437.5392
that very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success	3765.5322
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and dartagnan more than anyone	1363.9850
i will take him dead thats all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	1813.4189
bonacieuxlamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomedthe two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting	2501.9656
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself	4642.1064
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen _entrées_	3000.1948
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it	3689.0325
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies dartagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocationwhence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard	2026.0240
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	1596.5188
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent	1115.6143
my words have not convinced you	36.4679
one however fell at the dukes feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket	903.4149
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds i have nonenor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts what has happened said the count simulating total ignorance	2115.6904
then turning to grimaud very good my friend very good	5441.5073
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	1641.4247
bonacieux the comtesse de winter the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the rest	1055.8888
he preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	2452.3088
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured	1174.9038
de morcerf will accompany me bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six oclock	3849.6125
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of anotherconfide my shame to you a man and i a woman	1554.1511
and this conviction restored his strength	10957.8066
well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance	2243.3176
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme	1227.2605
i should make an excellent gambler if i were not too hotheaded but i was hotheaded just as if i had been drinking	1408.3151
well at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means	9009.7266
he would have spoken but his voice failed him	1460.9795
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priests wig the threecornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé	3421.7520
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements	1943.8408
we must go and find lord winter they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for	1505.0929
andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do charmingly as you see	1453.2435
she prevailed upon him to leave the country but to leave the country to fly together to reach another part of france where they might live at ease because unknown money was necessary	3469.5498
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour	1562.9421
one of the notaries sat down the other remained standing	5719.2241
ah dont be angry i beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me	554.2078
place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him no monseigneur no it is not he cried bonacieux no i was deceived	1020.8442
it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing	1160.4757
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	659.8003
at this moment the clock struck eleven	21898.3242
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myselfit is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it i agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations	1357.6481
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results	1390.3953
i hope so the friends embraced cordially dartagnan pressed raouls hand	21633.3574
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house	5192.9268
signed abbé busoni it is the same what do you mean said the major	822.6086
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there oh cried the duchess i cannot make war alone but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favoriteon the honor of a duchess i will avenge myself madame replied athos do not injure the vicomte de bragelonnedo not ruin his prospects	1902.1947
danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himselfhalfmalicious halfferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame	1364.8875
a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	2490.6741
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to dartagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his life	2557.5039
dartagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m	911.6956
the usurper converted decidedly my dear duke in what way converted to good principles	4646.6685
well said andreamy servants coat and my hat ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do you	776.2571
she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them madame said villefort believe me a fortune of francs is not so easily renounced she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent never mind replied villefort i say that this marriage _shall_ be consummated notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack	1879.2644
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julies cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count	1716.6437
made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont	3873.3616
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal	1458.6399
he took his army to the priests where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornets who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal dartagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companionsas the breakfast at the priests could only be counted as half a repastin return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him	1892.9302
follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskwhat is the form said he	1224.2885
the carmelite convent at béthune great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes	2433.9595
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived	2993.5500
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned	1645.0745
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening	1680.6344
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you	1440.0461
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit	14697.4941
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	1224.7351
the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles	1410.7629
de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be what does he appear to be why you have just saida man of high distinction i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such but what is your own opinion albert i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese i do not ask you of his origin but what he is ah what he is that is quite another thing	939.9387
at neufchâtel as at st valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him	2852.9480
as for the théatre français you know of course that it is nowhere	712.9826
come do you really think you have anything to say against me	476.8268
thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment	1059.0383
the queen had confidence in the courage of dartagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced	363.6119
haydée said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour	1254.1765
he commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed	1917.9203
we are observed they are coming to meet us	3613.8560
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached	1069.2440
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	1382.7930
de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him	1516.1469
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence you think of starting at once then inquired mordaunt	1069.6794
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves	865.6232
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence	4426.7124
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer	3863.5481
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands	1668.6086
the steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each others torches	12149.7012
i confess it but pardon to every sin you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper	1031.8832
listen attentively alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word m	4216.8745
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz	1490.3290
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary and yet this letter must be somewhere would you dare to lift your hand to your queen said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening	1867.8043
dartagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	3261.8311
well answered the boy the thing is done where is he gone the halfpistole is for me doubtless answer me i want to see it	1043.1326
almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning	3029.9233
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian	4533.7769
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champsélysées	1676.3892
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	1147.5909
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else	5977.5239

the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champsélysées or by the faubourg sainthonoré his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the counts and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressingroom	1289.5195
did she stay long there an hour and a half did she return home directly well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening	1331.0453

doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy	1535.6031
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous	2168.1802
i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his the rascal is rich then some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twentyfive and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more hum said gondy laughing i was not aware my alms were so well invested in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush	2341.9304
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m	12458.3838
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is a forgery how can that be yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you but it is dartagnan that will come do not deceive yourself	894.7344
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire fire then when the shot was fired	1945.7233
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room	1844.9508

this was the price of the queens diamond	2222.8774
the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port m my dear friends said morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven impossible impossible but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receiptedthe splendid diamond	1497.9645
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacons dress got in by his side	2380.6953
why to converse with him of course	1527.6498
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire	3556.0476
no it was a very near thing but he is not dead as he said this dartagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him	640.6696
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m	992.7557
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton	17034.7480
dartagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god	2333.1863
noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her	521.6248
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children	3835.3210
but what are you about there	5389.8442
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated explain yourself said grimaud	5938.1377
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with châteaurenaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation	1468.5969
dépinay cannot leave the drawingroom at present it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m	1176.4175
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	1311.5515
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries	2826.7642
well be on our side now resumed aramis	7097.5781
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	2112.8523
what i mean to say is this sirthat during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting a play yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other that is quite my desire you have seen m	1502.8209

as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france	5346.5947
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majestys well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	1561.6631
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants	1521.6143
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well theres nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos	811.1566
in this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound	2067.3811
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	912.6077
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	1720.8234
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south	2531.4736
who is this creature grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time	1761.2368
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	1427.1121
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers	2043.2819
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon	2072.0613
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship	2741.7646
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him	2544.3572
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	1482.3770
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion	6242.2124
the matter was no longer doubtful	156906.3906
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her breathe you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her	1307.1947
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifes having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt	2787.6235
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger go then sir and god keep you the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops palace	1671.4675
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property	3019.2393

then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again	6462.0483
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the waxlight always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment	3894.5967
it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard said he	4104.7866
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet how my friend planchet	5202.9946
his whiskers cut off noirtier gave another turn to his hair took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and highbuttoned frockcoat a coat of villeforts of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the glass a narrowbrimmed hat of his sons which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics	2126.5186
i tell you valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m	3035.5081
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands	3549.2917

the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beetsugar probably a composition of his own	2506.0610
to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirtysix degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit	2397.1614
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle	2411.0359
i shall go and die by his side madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself oh god exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to heaven have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully i once spoke to you of four men what can be done with four four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time and where are these four men ah that is what i do not know	2611.9348
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something	1131.9265
i have made him a spy upon his wife the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and retired	1907.0226
that day the ministers clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his illhumor	939.2116
was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen	724.4492
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner	1513.3379
he feared then to see her too often	6900.0239
we have secured him yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason porthos pressed his friends hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charless retreat was advancing to meet the english regiments	2193.9839
i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations	2273.2466
as he had twenty times touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	2568.6194
do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper	2903.3733
the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them off	752.1317
endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man	1701.1256
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud	1436.5004
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	5611.5469
but let us be quickthe king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort levêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in m	982.6791
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champsélysées which had already assumed that palacelike appearance which the counts princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences	2775.4148
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different affair yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that inot in the least i beg you to believe	1300.0121
the time and place are but illsuited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious	1223.1051

noirtier had once made a will against youagainst your familyin favor of the poor in fact m	3249.2261
i believe everything said athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing	8249.9971
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chiefs consent did the same	2569.0210
oh unhappy woman cried the commissary	86069.4062
each retired to his own apartment	260643.8125
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain it is my intention so to do come let us hear you	1644.2267
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance	1171.2942
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	1949.7336
the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrates study	2244.4304
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	1542.2074
and you think you can catch him yes if we are better mounted than he go then take what guards you find here and pursue him you command us my lord to do so and i sign my orders said mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines monsieur du vallon your barony is on the back of the duc de beauforts horse you have nothing to do but to overtake it	1672.6388
debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do	3247.9868
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot	993.6346

edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration	2623.2705
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	550.2925
we cannot say how long the night seemed to milady but dartagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness	2705.8518
he was a berrichon thirtyfive or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent	3584.4849

his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant	4193.1377

debray my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you	1554.2423

i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out	1480.3101
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina	2193.8228
but dartagnan had now slipped through the window	2265.1692
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast nine	3198.8574

after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god but let me see how was it done	1021.5635
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter	2915.3970
it is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	2630.7891
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared	763.1307
they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel now you get angry and attack our poor agents	2646.2112
why you see he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly ah _ma foi_ under any circumstances said caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effectunder any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dantès is he danglars no you are rightand i should say that would bring him illluck well never mind answered caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while danglars had merely sipped his	2904.3384
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter	2880.5703
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept	4795.6973
dartagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurators wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped	1071.7651
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien with piercing eyes a large brow and a thin face which was made still longer by a _royal_ or _imperial_ as it is now called surmounted by a pair of mustaches	1892.6558
a man whose name is franz dépinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda no he is a man about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a knittingneedle but he paid your ransom he said two words to the chief and i was free and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp	1726.4131
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	6225.0674
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us	1556.8451
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	1116.8187
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all knowpoor franz dépinay ah true said debray you did fight some time ago about what m the devil take me if i remember returned châteaurenaud	2698.1367
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet	2307.4470
i had the king and monsieur the whole of one day in my care	716.8990
and the other one demanded the count	188.2001
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_ who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	1798.0486
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment	2055.5559
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i cannot explain to you	817.3704
then wretched creature then you tempted god a third time	5897.5986
at last his patience was exhausted	25776.7324
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him and are there no cardinals that can fight	1209.0825
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her	2742.5493
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m	731.0162
so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box	3903.5471
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideasno feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all	1016.2701

de tréville how the affair came to pass	2118.7856

replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back	5147.2603
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m	833.5647
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sundial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sundial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longerbytheby sir do you think dormice eat them indeed i should think not replied monte cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did what	1643.6154
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldricin ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous	1679.3302
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and m	1336.1771
dartagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge	344.2311
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him	1137.1687
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex	3195.0464
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	16725.8145
but we have not done with the thing yet m do you indeed think so inquired the marquise	1092.9362
and madame de villefort cried baptistin	23108.4707
take this ring raise money with it and let your husband set out in an hour you shall be obeyed you see the address said the queen speaking so low that mme	951.7307
but what is the meaning of all these questions to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes how is that i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it what is it	1034.6230
if so speak out answered athos	716.2075
i am her best friend upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here no they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen indeed and who dartagnan and his friends indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille why is it not done already what would you	820.0031
are there then two parliaments my friend dartagnan interrupted as i dont understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance ah excellent said aramis	1259.4670
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination	3086.0315
we must extricate ourselves from this position but how listen you must try to see her and have an explanation with her	998.0232
let us sit down villefort fell rather than seated himself	12278.9395
the total amount was found to be as m	133.3713
i took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners again said dartagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners_	1705.8076
duc dharcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldnt look for us where we were	2977.8254
more pale and menacing than athos dartagnan stood on the threshold	2280.9570
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak	1050.7972
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who was that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count	919.9601
himself my lord but he is said to be a furious mazarinist phew whistled planchet	1449.1511
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept	1975.4030
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night and where do the servants sleep oh they have a house to themselves	1332.8236
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor	1865.9945
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals arm	3335.7363
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases	2309.5098
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake	988.2107
it does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors and why among us four inquired caderousse	2208.8911
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	2033.9459
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not	255.1339
a gentleman laughed in my face	19084.8906
she told dartagnan that lord de winter was her brotherinlaw and not her brother	1406.5735
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companionit is true then that all our actions leave their tracessome sad others brighton our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sandsit leaves its track alas to many the path is traced by tears sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not	2782.1367
the latter retained the counts hand between his	2111.4363
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de saintméran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand	953.5245
we must play the farce to the end	287.6680
no replied dartagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people cannot see whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion chastised monsieur said dartagnan the expression is strong it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face ah _pardieu_ i know full well that you dont turn your back to yours and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly	1916.0500
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor	4945.9805
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonadesellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it	693.4885
it is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times to other placeswhich very likely have no connection with the present time and place	2129.2207
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where theres a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place oh my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it still by one of your forty methods your highness yes yes indeed my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness willingly answered the duke give me the pie i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste	2272.3264
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house	2271.4436
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	2363.8589
bonacieux addressing this epithet to her husband	3952.4282
dartagnan uttered a slight cry of joy this woman or rather this apparitionfor the carriage passed with the rapidity of a visionwas mme	2251.9978
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter	2006.3503
the beggar the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced	1900.4313
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	1627.5525
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	2072.5583
what do you think of this he asked in a low voice	662.4796
now attach him to our party	27799.6992
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis	839.3124
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto	2554.7832
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him	2212.4783
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousses glass and do not interfere with us yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah but the meansthe means said fernand	3677.7214
dartagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris	3162.3586
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	3104.2527
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent	809.4240
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community	8358.7891
what do you say to it aramis why the idea of taking quarters with senor perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part i agree to it	1207.5350
our bestborn and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it	4986.2319
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for fourandtwenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf	1308.5068
yes and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may maximilian understood him	2163.0955
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity	2215.1743
the three musketeers possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about dartagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from dartagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent	1004.5839
but will you be able to follow me oh yes your wound gives me pain but will not prevent my walking be ready then at the first signal milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed	1947.7758
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	1066.3423
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard	8240.9150
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	2354.6138
what shall we do yes why the same we had intended doing three days sinceset off whatalthough you are not now going to be married you intend still listen louise	3628.8689
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants	2922.2710
dartagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad	1066.5315
i used all my influence with one of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to one of the galleries	659.0978
you have deceived me said the cardinal sternly	2581.4666
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	1793.9285
that is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife but i have not told you that i know him cried bonacieux in despair	1011.1935
and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gateto be close to you without really seeing youhave i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength	1281.2378
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them	2357.2617
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton	2607.8652
now said planchet let us thank the queen	1915.4297
return to paris said he assemble the servants who remain there	2968.0779
the evening of the betrothal chapter	48792.0391

debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege	3073.1150
what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt	4600.9502
monsieur dartagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach m	1358.9952
he will never see you again all is over	1755.5444
explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment	15648.5342
and how do you know it asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart	1326.0925
the chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyères for a week	1323.0255
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him	2265.7546
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal	1688.5305
carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa and teresa was as handsome as carmela	1612.3146
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue	2519.3918
at this instant the door opened	33679.5586
i should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the dinner really my dear m	3177.8708
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queens appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place	1101.9962
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maidservant	2203.0352
well what have i learned since	39514.4297
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule	2356.6919
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself	5925.5620
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured	1471.8407
the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchetthat was the name of the picard	1195.3188
all is well i thank you now leave us alone mr felton chapter l	8022.5239
you see said porthos this is my usual style devil take me answered dartagnan i wish you joy of it	1495.3033
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from yanina from yanina yes impossible here is my passport examine the visageneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina	1968.0835
from whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife from monsieur laporte did he give you any details he knew none himself and you have learned nothing from any other quarter yes i have received what i fear i am committing a great imprudence you always come back to that but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat i do not retreat _mordieu_ cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage	1321.0001
the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti not so mademoiselle eugénie danglars	10182.4336
ah said porthos let us hear what he says dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows dear dartagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me	1882.4528
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst	3683.1514
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel	2508.9368
meanwhile what are you going to do i yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true	1131.3226
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not he is really out sir replied baptistin	1106.9277
flee alone flee alone and leave you here	1669.7269
however i had better find him out first since he cant want money	3853.2083
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night scoundrel murmured felton	1459.5792
aha what blood at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	3301.3572
what my maid tells me but what does she tell you that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge	901.6354
a lady it was said had just fainted they had supplied her with a smellingbottle and she had recovered	1152.3813
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property	845.1188
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things what did you please to say sir asked caderousse	2188.7039
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel	1334.8373
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice	1631.2010
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon	3201.6775
bravo athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	2585.9807
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him	1194.2148
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of dartagnan and porthos in their hands	1122.9314
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him	3937.0642
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table	2490.3950
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	4546.5845
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth	2860.9788
danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes yes said monte cristo i think m	4414.0615
how pale you are no but i have just met with a terrible adventure are you alone athos _parbleu_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and dartagnan rushed into athoss chamber	1252.8185
morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away but i have no more ships and therefore i do not want any sailors no more ships returned penelon well then youll build some well wait for you i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i cannot accept your kind offer no more money	2073.4360
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the corso	1314.0192
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother	1567.2841
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	1218.4534
at your service sir he continued	41706.5078
as to dartagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black	1913.1742
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto	831.3791
good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	2618.8625
will you examine them oh m	892.5697
two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden	1857.4661
i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase	1984.1238
to horse reechoed athos everything is arranged and decided now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and st denis the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors they mountedthe king on winters horse and winter on that of the king then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second	1003.5320
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room	1300.2874
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain	2901.8064
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio	4502.1514
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses	1016.2696
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this francs child sighed mercédès	4396.0181
he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	2931.0461
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering	509.2236
he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse	1822.3986
what doest thou here goodfornothing she said and why art thou not at notre dame i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazins permissionyou know mother monsieur bazin the vergeri came to speak to monsieur broussel and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	2345.3604
and does he not live in the champsélysées yes no ah said caderousse no yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior	1220.0220
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given dartagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	1682.9825
tréville was one of these latter	116268.8047
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before	1347.9180
the day on which dartagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province	3028.1091
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris do you hesitate asked mazarin	2732.9607
five minutes after the doorkeeper again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety	1586.8828
the young man was opening the door of the stable	222.5759
suddenly edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of fernand as it was defined in the shadow	2130.1731
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others	1426.1659
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal	3777.7366
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the papers	5679.7793
dartagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others	1799.3154
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe	2550.0757
age has warmed not chilled your blood	4085.8955
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m	2423.2129
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	2878.7974
i own to you that that young mans visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep	2302.3242
no i searched the whole thicket	35529.1016
if i should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and windows	2290.6138
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven oclock of the morning in the month of january sir said planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know tell us what returned dartagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort perfectly one of my dearest friends ah so much the better but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room ah sir i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated	1332.5148
people cry out long live the king down with mazarin thats nothing new no weve been used to those acclamations for some time and you sing chorus replied guitant laughing	3242.6758
chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person	1187.6388
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture	1589.7054
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak	3058.9951
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lipsand without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter	2537.4282
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette	3396.8435
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriagedoor	399.0100
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now	797.3757
and i also said dartagnan i also	1637.9836
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	3012.1987
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance	4358.4814
that poor child said madame de villefort when valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness meanwhile valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edwards room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase	2511.8013
will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from blois to send me a few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt	4040.6780
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful	630.6555
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors	2202.4617
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness but we must say farewell edmond and let us part before i leave you mercédès have you no request to make said the count	1168.1128
shall i open the secretaire asked valentine	10294.9082
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was arthur	2636.6174
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right _animadvertuntur in desertis_ a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	1663.6885
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	1330.3417
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	1582.7189
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done	1482.8817
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	343.8755
no no like shakespeares polonius he died for another	3601.5078
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	2851.3228
here i have brought mine with me replied albert	648.0495
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly	1278.3452
pray was not monsieur dartagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude toguitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak outi know nothing but what the public knows	1825.0614
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey	897.8582
but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray	1584.3975
go on as i entered nîmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned	5039.0361
de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him	1774.4225
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos	1467.8478
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it	977.8306
it is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting	3250.5898
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything	2981.8906
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution	790.0662
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her	1702.9525
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	525.8217
i have not said goodmorning to you monsieur dartagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you	535.1918
take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness m oh sir said caderousse putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his browoh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings	1514.3521
noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw valentine and his eye brightened	1310.3762
it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant	8832.1270
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him	2262.6636
yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings milady sprang out of bed	4057.6494
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champsélysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel	2050.7178
excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m	742.5047
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentines mind	2147.6389
are you satisfied my lord he asked	1379.1758
suppose her majesty refuses oh said dartagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs	2197.8508
then he has not returned said the duke	339.3227
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir say my highness is furious to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there	1434.3875
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind	1752.3370
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha	816.2483
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem	23257.7734
i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again	2449.1980
take a cigar really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rosecolored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standhow happy you are to have nothing to do	3467.9653
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good shall i take any arms for what purpose any money it is useless	2263.8679
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been	1033.7043
this fawncolored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queenlike grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul	2890.7056
at length they arrived at the famous room	3228.2107
i was pretty drunk yesterday dartagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous	834.4512
in this kind of game not to kill is to let ones self be killed	1753.3827
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine	10718.1885
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed	2402.3933
and what may be that description dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frockcoat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his buttonhole a hat with wide brim and a cane ah ha thats it is it said noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coqhéron didnt i say that your police were good for nothing yes but they may catch him yet true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance at these words he rose and put off his frockcoat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his sons toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers	2257.9192
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world	825.9322
she loves him devilishly he murmured	25273.5137
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her	1489.9410
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	12983.6357
indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish i foppish	4218.6201
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time	1638.0477
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward dartagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which dartagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that dartagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight	1503.5155
and now prisoner will you consent to tell your name said the president	1047.2393
from that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it	1446.0946
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz	852.7753
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys	1977.5839
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years	712.2758
de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man	1050.1597
you cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queens hand led her to the window	3134.1274
my father said i was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me my child do you remember your father haydée the young greek smiled	2067.4680
they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed energy	1754.6749
it was dartagnan who was waiting for him	815.2097
de tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the bastille	2852.4636
then you love me said she	326.4138

the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio	1331.8910
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	949.3235
and you you dartagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners	2943.0037

lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient bertuccio bowed and left the room	4427.8735
it was written and signed by albert	1361.7865
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak very well said dartagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet	2084.3660
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk openworked stockings passed a white and tolerably nicelooking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	3940.6404
oh this is too much cried milady	10160.1426
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders and good old penelon making signals to m	4520.5308
dartagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions	4382.0547
monte cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of wood	3082.5107
dartagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron	885.5117
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table	1680.6520
silence he said or you are lost	3556.0442
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year of the hegira	375.9701
the prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken	645.9815

it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the th the francs of m	633.6895
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	578.6549
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination	1234.5356
what you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead	1421.8643
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died	687.2874
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits	2230.1255

for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared	1409.6541
she drew her husband to the door	189.7744
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them	2023.5225

no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne and shall we arrive there safe and sound as true as my names jack butler well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named	1727.6986
my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me	2750.0305
dartagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre	3068.1484
i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin but but but he must make me a baron zounds said dartagnan thats settled already i will be responsible for the barony on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the castle	2174.4587
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others	7945.9922
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm	1715.7526
as we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at cours la reine	1588.8862
he was very successful upon that question	1869.1069
every career is open to you	34.9167
the memory of richelieu annihilates me	798.0242
deuce take it cried dartagnan more moved than he had been for a long time dont despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one oh really cried raoul	1576.0569
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house	2562.5417
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want eh pardieu said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money	1603.9784
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascons uneasiness	4272.3062
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence yieldyou yield to me do you not a giant had seized also aramiss two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp	2600.7446
when do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to caderousse	2894.7307
this lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us	3258.3428
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home stop a moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my companions	1754.8975
de trévilles hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship havent i chapter vi	4151.9609
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and sidedishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head	3195.8296
two of the men from jacopos boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles	2390.9229
on my honor they are not poisoned	1773.9148
dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken	778.4263
let me propose it then said dartagnan	162.2605
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way	2046.0176
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces	14082.5596
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton	493.2903
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousses murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends	1475.6875
morrel here is the _pharaon_ without a captain oh replied danglars since we cannot leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantès will be set at liberty no doubt but in the meantime i am entirely at your service m	2375.1201
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	749.4102
have the goodness to send mine to athoss residence	5910.6846
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this friends answered charles sadly i have but threeone of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a weeks standing whom i shall never forget	2697.1128
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart	747.1224
leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied my dear albert said franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see _litalienne à alger_ agreed returned albert but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes	2459.6060
_la jeune amélie_ was first at the rendezvous	1799.8474
there said dartagnan we cant be overtaken	3350.8364
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame	1685.4512
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron	1002.8757
a passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london	1392.1765
after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some soninlaw or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king	5015.0557
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two years do you think so said mercédès	2115.2141
here are five francs for his trouble indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark	1705.6847
sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them	799.7800
the man in the red cloak chapter lxv	42068.3047
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	2307.5811
he shall not come in before i am gone said he and when i am gone you can open to him but i ought to be gone too	874.9240
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you dartagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man oh thats very well young man continued m	1806.3810
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought	3531.3230
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	9977.9385
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much	4083.0129
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	3531.7136
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder	2461.2603
a boattwothree murmured my fatherfour he then arose seizing his arms and priming his pistols	4100.0996
the moment you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french law i know it sir replied monte cristo but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves	1398.4159
revenge yourself then edmond cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culpritson him on me but not on my son it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation	1292.4214
wait said valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated wawewi the old man stopped her at the last syllable	1623.1681
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	1082.1559
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future	975.8342
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study	3541.3496
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald	2242.6213
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	3193.8613
oh how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	758.8206
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands	5042.8818
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again never see you again exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julies cheeks never behold you again	3001.7432
at ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented	2860.4727
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating ladys men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day the _bonnes fortunes_ of de tréville were talked of as those of m	2588.3271
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her anger	804.2065
these studs cannot be trusted to anybody it must be done in the palace impossible my lord there is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the old therefore my dear mr oreilly you are my prisoner	1359.8016
i am doing what is right the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with dartagnan	1678.4952
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits	8400.4561
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	1263.5961
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor these were the beggars of the court of miraclesthe agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache preparing barricades for the morrow	2566.0840
look at me madameat me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly	3865.4277
no longer could edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	2077.2341
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume	3282.0854
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinalthe choice made it must be persisted in	887.9764
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	934.1426
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him	1520.0594
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile	1595.1864
we must go replied villefort offering his arm	6017.3032
de saintméran before you bought it it appears so replied monte cristo	1419.5332
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a whole pile which concerns you	1683.0098
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking	2687.6689
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself	2195.8438
ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder	2877.0767
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever	4094.3872
therefore if you part with m	939.8321
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	1248.6871
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting	1537.0133
they were rapidly leaving the château dif behind	25222.0332
tony carries our muskets then we set sail tonight asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished	3722.7700
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit	1554.6604
when the two musketeers had entered when the door was closed behind them when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced when m	1876.7714
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come m you think then all is not over yet said albert horrorstricken	1362.8103
without me you would both have died	3204.3169
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to herbe assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence	1224.6141
bonacieux to the chamber of examination	15612.8330
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith	1043.9890
for you and your comrades this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm	2742.6003
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	2446.7117
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits	2219.5654
one night however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my desire to go up to him but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying	897.6938
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondys coachman	1151.9022
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor	3395.5447
but my lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far what do you say	1030.2343
sit down morrel and wait morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven	3402.8711
just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow	2045.2723
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf	747.2610
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	4494.0991
you will not touch the garden either as to the yard you may do what you please with it i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency	1335.7700
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde whilst mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the palais royal	3096.4795
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable enough	2356.6492
you must dress him up during my absence	10976.9893
you spent it as you pleased that was your business	1668.9397
well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her workroom and by whom was your wife abducted i know nothing surely monsieur but i suspect someone and who is the person whom you suspect a man who has pursued her a long time the devil but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this less love than politics replied dartagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect monsieur i beg you to observe that i ask you absolutely nothing	1239.4714
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows	5317.7314
nono i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery	864.8917
but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	1706.7407
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts	931.7289
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn	2138.5134
the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords and returned them to their sheaths	2824.5020
yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the count	1796.2430
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use	1677.3247
if you can my dear dartagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris then said aramis this falls out very well he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty	1350.3420
it is the first time he has ever been in paris	1223.1318
mazarin took the letter and read it thus mr mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris	3223.2485
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy	2291.3218
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again	10718.0859
do you know them fernand he said	113.0616
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin dor there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux	2072.8181
i have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you	1542.1588
at neufchâtel go to the tavern of the golden harrow give the password to the landlord and you will find as you have here a horse ready saddled have i anything to pay demanded dartagnan	1087.6395
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything	6573.9346
besides dartagnan has not told us his idea yet and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast	1445.4514
dearest exclaimed valentine with her adorable smile awake and look at me morrel uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees	5189.1050
they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village the redtiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an augustine brother	2588.8059
i detest him an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income thats true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune dartagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses	1457.6637
you know i have made the most of my arms though i never forgot my origin a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo	2296.5732
but you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host	1884.4673
it is you bernouin she said	95.9680
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	1204.9375
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room	2877.9712
ah said dartagnan who began to understand	937.7156
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration	1478.1525
a presentiment instantly told dartagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently	1640.5107
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercers house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac	3245.9182
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	1015.0341
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	2199.0103
it was one of the gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty	10769.1719
at the end of a year dantès was a new man	2437.2915
pooh what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé dherblay ah his friend is with him said raoul	2064.2930
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	2358.6738
and my only heir are you not said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady	1018.2958
he converted his chamber into an observatory	3905.2339
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen mazarin listened intently	2568.7700
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	1357.8429
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron _eo rus_ and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable	3423.9685
as to the lefthand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior	1644.0817
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be usefulthat of the king exactly answered the musketeer	1145.5013
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed	2623.4031
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	1161.4340
your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it and so my dear count said dartagnan his eminence didnt actually insist on our attending him it is du vallon and i who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise	1599.7332
what ails you my dearest father	13996.1875
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there	638.8384
why did he kill himself instead of you	565.2019
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	2014.3431
it is very simple mousqueton had said he is thinking of groslow it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parrys head	1692.2561
we must then as it appears to me travel in company	2045.1904
as to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever i escape from his hands	943.6130
general oliver cromwell the four friends looked at one another	1973.5764
_ecco_ said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him	1830.3463
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise a hundred louis well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something	1082.9958
he perceived châteaurenaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeantatarms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done	1690.3334
i try to be beloved not feared well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says like master like servant pray what does that mean it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them he the point aimed at by every poniard richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends	2384.0454
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said hegood good you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of sanfelices daughter	1606.3917
drink a glass of port said aramis it will refresh you yes let us drink said athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with dartagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country	2386.9824
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself	1282.5532
upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds	5748.6216

has the daughter of ali tepelini spoken the truth said the president	3960.4084
two or three masks strove to knock his _moccoletto_ out of his hand but albert a firstrate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo	1962.1127
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings room	1274.4391
meanwhile villefort and davrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	1843.1825
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso	2076.5864
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in	822.0569
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman	1409.5693
noirtier rue coqhéron no murmured he growing still paler	12016.3545
aramis related what had been agreed upon	7397.5142
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner	988.3483
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his heart	1173.2675
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united	1215.0518
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	1352.3145
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	588.9165
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	1649.5046
dartagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage	402.7257
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and cannot now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating	2088.7617
then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables	11652.7275
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father	2386.9438
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors	2066.6431
haydées nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowersnay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence	2356.0649
well dantès you do not thank me this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only	1479.9642
take her six bottles of different winecyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters get them at borels and be sure you say they are for me at what oclock sir do you breakfast m what time is it now a quarter to ten very well at half past ten	1799.0134
yes said aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself be satisfied replied dartagnan the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell he then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller	773.1534
the visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawingrooms	1564.5057
in an instant dantès plan was formed	3088.6785
oh yes she cried i do love you i love you as one loves a father brother husband i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings m let it be then as you wish sweet angel god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies and has given me this reward he will not let me end my triumph in suffering i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me	1261.2484
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man	200.1673
they laugh best who laugh last having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawingroom whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée dantin	2235.0300
pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight no said albert the engagement is broken off well said beauchamp	2025.5518
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers	2490.9841
in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the kings window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it ah cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard probably said dartagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends	1439.6692
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish imagination	2517.8076
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars	2592.5491
porthos was the first to speak	25402.9863
dartagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat	2031.4579
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there	3036.3999
the halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us thirty forty fifty sixtyfive men said porthos counting the reinforcements	2909.1812
ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see what therethat calash filled with roman peasants no well i am convinced they are all charming women how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other but in spite of alberts hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants	2730.8567
the hostess replied only by gasps	24610.2207
ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea ah dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship _pharaon_ then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried	4636.4346
but what shall you do with him with whom with albert what shall i do with albert	506.6166
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a lookingglass	2511.6323
they reentered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud	1789.8605
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes	3333.3606
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you sufferyou maximilian whom i love as my own son	2868.0337
laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a run	1753.5884
how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars	3054.3047
come porthos come mousqueton they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible	2346.9578
i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days nor i said madame danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish which m	1405.4431
deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood	2490.2383
and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning	2468.4827
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir	1472.1033
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	4264.8892
it is late and the governor is asleep	16289.7568
do you know that he asked	53006.1055
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos	1870.1401
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined	1524.4938
dartagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber	1326.2804
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles	1323.4078
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace	636.6315
six days ago i landed at portsmouth well said felton	1761.3007
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	1448.7911
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	1422.8918
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime say absurd since it has become useless	3973.1382
you know well that i dont like to leave things half finished conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis	5491.3818
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair	2523.9912
he placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	2848.6428
madame will be tired tonight continued monte cristo and will no doubt wish to rest	2681.7456
i _beseech_ you the superior and mme	1365.7853
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected	1740.3451
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure hell be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires	2168.3984
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land	2752.2122
thats very kind of him here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man	374.4108
oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist	2016.6516
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	2148.5659
in short what shall i say to you felton continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime	1454.1301
the cardinal writes better than i thought	571.0201
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto	347.5310
what could they desire beyond their liberty	31154.5605
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst dartagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left	434.1201
my dear albert said debray rising it is halfpast two	3650.9949
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc dangoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	1907.5137
etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him	180.0280
de tréville in the same tone that a party of _procureurs_ commissaries and men of the policevery estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniformhave taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort levêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos athos said the king mechanically yes certainly i know that name let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously	2205.9248
i am the queen do you recognize me no madame replied dartagnan	603.2552
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man	1185.7556
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	2087.1370
i will go said comminges and if they come back fire not at allnot at all replied dartagnan let no one move	1514.4271
read the address monsieur el comte de wardes the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon	2543.3564
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	1260.4933
on descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view	4784.4502
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move	3297.7354
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	3239.2944
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch	3319.8713
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty swordthrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you who is it it is monsieur dartagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise	1360.8530
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot are you well fed repeated the inspector	1179.0586
a letter said the young man	338.6389
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companions words	2438.7854
although about fortyfour or fortyfive years old she might have passed for thirtyfive	3890.4836
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me m right dantès quite right	1100.9274
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	2621.4038
in fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	2134.4670
but were you not on horseback	18165.1895
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	3204.3105
dust i am and to dust i return	4911.4985
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel chapter	10328.1367
after a moments silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium	1124.6273
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now no father stammered villefort at least i hope not and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care oh rely on me said villefort	1883.3309
de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre	1139.2637
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it	522.3500
dartagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for	2004.5391
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes	3348.1436
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun	1784.4756
you understandno more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	620.3744
i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do tis well arise vicomte embrace me raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the counts arms	3322.5762
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits you	1257.1918
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued	2319.6106
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	1474.6416
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults	1708.7684
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped	1647.3462
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	3133.3025
m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht	4244.8965
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	1106.7963
caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour m the abbé busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied	2848.6047
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it	4649.2354
let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was for i always understood you were a bachelor that was the general opinion sir said the major and i yes replied the count and you confirmed the report	730.2017
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twentythree years of age said athos in a low tone	1413.0978
my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you deep grief was depicted on morrels features he seized monte cristos hand	2138.7163
bonacieux was going that was to follow her	1117.7649
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting	2220.6970
i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling remorse i finish your phrase	7188.9644
monte cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawingroom	864.7028
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman chatillon and flamarens started	1245.3882
yeschristian and surname are the same	12059.8428
religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions	4295.6958
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m	2405.2554
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count	1921.2667
m maximilian my dearest brother she cried	1580.1724
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	32796.2461
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	3105.9968
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinala change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution	1327.4476
the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built reached dantès ear distinctly as they went forward	4112.2861
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly	2087.1758
de boville who from having been an inspector of prisons was promoted to a high office in the police and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars	1867.0483
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won	1280.4518
de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her	1593.4181
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve	1954.6990
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	2257.3079
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé	1456.1653
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you	937.9003
general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg electronic works by reading or using any part of this project gutenberg electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property trademarkcopyright agreement	3098.0420
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	903.9048
it is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart	2265.2686
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed	6725.0254
here i am wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us why all these precautions you shall know milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	2504.1152
i not only permit i desire let them come in the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	1553.4021
from time to time parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but charles would open his eyes and say with a smile go on my good parry i am listening groslow advanced to the door of the kings room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to dartagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved	1854.0688
good heavens we are on the very eve of it	284.4054
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there ah truly	1620.1832
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and iat least i understood it so when will it be our turn to think of these things	1579.7738
it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m	966.6002
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	6040.1226
well monsieur laporte placed her near her majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence abandoned as she is by the king watched as she is by the cardinal betrayed as she is by everybody ah ah it begins to develop itself said dartagnan	1569.9147
eh no do not surrender egad on the contrary be off and quickly	2262.7974
it was nearly eight oclock when they set out again	3389.3523
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it	1434.3990
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	2851.6709
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	1080.8661
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect	2307.2720
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you	518.0729
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is fernand whom you see here is a good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named mercédès but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the _pharaon_ and as the _pharaon_ arrived todaywhy you understand no i do not understand said danglars	1279.5375
albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs	1862.0171
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos	435.8880
but the duke is our friend the duke is english the duke fights against us	3668.1204
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid	780.4783
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	111.7990
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i cannot comprehend indeed yes well then tell him this rochefort	3430.5315
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass	3114.2395
adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death	2991.2041
and we did not surrenderno they dragged us away by force	5253.2876
as soon as she was gone noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary	2619.3257
i had been tracked by a customsofficer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile	1316.2032
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	1049.2997
oh i am very presuming i am aware	1626.5206
no no said fernand restraining him stay it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès	1232.4652
oh yes was the ready answer	14574.1914
de saintméran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying	3801.8904
go to the assistance of madame de villefort he said to the nurse	812.1586
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me	1024.1763
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	4094.9065
here am i milady here am i cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress	3919.6511

you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation	851.3796

why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the _si_ as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal	2235.1025
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the kings attorney and thats all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke	1546.0715

the two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage	3550.3342
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain golden dreams cried aramis	1118.3716
pardon me said albert i was not aware that he was a prince	397.3943
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms	693.4915
apropos said dartagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent	2190.6816
de morcerf so early had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general	823.3962
de trévilles stablesone for himself dartagnan and one for planchetand bring them to athoss place	1895.1655
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	1382.3242
keep your moneykeep it i sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it it was offered with good will said dantès	1453.2054
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream	1893.2046
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed	4904.0801
why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me	1771.1898
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	1608.1522
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m	1155.3635
is my father here most undoubtedly replied monte cristo your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared	2163.9165
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	1204.9305
oh dear yes sir the abbés dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonapartes emissariesone of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in a very resolute and very dangerous man indeed said the englishman	1148.2844
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed	4975.8242
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality	1756.8081
he saw dartagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance	5383.0791
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house well baron what is there difficult to understand about that merely the term _unlimited_nothing else certainly is not that word known in france	2669.9355
it will be even more difficult to descend dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	2385.8572
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majestys wishes charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	2204.5337
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him alas you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough	792.1700
bigamy my dear come now you dont really wish it but he is dead i am sure of it he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave peste my darling another way of getting hanged so you refuse my request to be sure i dofuriously the pretty landlady was desolate	1421.2535
i desire to know what is the meaning of this be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars	688.3924
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	1796.5934
then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing	1495.5970
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang	1998.4263
how could i help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing i meet you face to faceyou of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before i had seen you ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last and milady stretched out her arms to mme	1404.4844
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody elses	2136.2437
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	400.3891
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis	3866.0176
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	2297.2183
you understand this do you not my most precious wife	2936.7766
mercédès seized fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow	1744.0752
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	2333.3799
all day dantès walked up and down his cell	1955.9912
you are right father i understand you then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for methanks morrel caught his hand	782.3177
it was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	1045.1770
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in _the bride of lammermoor_	2429.4478
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards	2815.7773
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women	7386.6719
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone i suppose not	1175.2467
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and dartagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	2240.9248
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers alas this desperate resistance could not last long	3165.4817
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand	4849.9370
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak	1454.1641
i do not wish to cause you any remorse believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind the man looked at the banknotes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the waterjug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs	1281.2861
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	1179.0704
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedettovillefort having retired as well as noirtier and davrignyher thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard	1901.0803
de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders	1433.1124
what are you no longer in possession of your senses	1007.3694
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down	1773.5841
i have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a hussy	1505.1331
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory	2579.1399
have you had any account of it none	376.9576
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for _terra firma_ and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	1310.8187
there only they explained to them the matter in hand	591.2130
ho ho said he good advice advice of a friend	955.4789
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this houseyes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice	1504.2412
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression	2073.7820
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under dartagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself	2679.0552
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately	10447.1904
what were you doing replied she	317.4695
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	1471.7600
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared	1502.2936
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days	955.6064
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa	4133.8223
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	1424.2535
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed	1662.3650
de villefort was as usual unmoved	28557.2051
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coollysuch were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely	1606.3014
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee truly honor luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest	1267.7477
he would not take them said he with slight emotion	1513.4663
rely on me dartagnan knew that although a gascon m	1868.3744
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter	2283.6875
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket	1212.9395
if victorious i shall continue the struggle if beaten i am lost	1838.1288
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	3297.7761
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today	2138.0149
he was a dead man and on my honor if i had discovered that it was his son i should have regretted having killed him ah sir said raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellows life to thank you on my own account	1403.6884
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest hush said milady let us not even here speak thus of him	2421.3936
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity	8604.6465
de morcerf is it that excellent m	2924.7036
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards	2823.0222
you notice my ring said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends	1089.0651
_au revoir_ benedetto and running into a court he disappeared	3235.2964
_holà_ mousqueton seats and order double the bottles do you know what we are eating here said athos at the end of ten minutes	1074.4070
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said come aramis now for the honor of france and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded	1938.7495
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier	2743.2202
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door	1437.9197
the king wishes to get a sleep one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone	1063.9993
but though i cannot give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my fathers	1829.4850
debraydo i wish to know himdo i wish to know that he gives advicedo i wish to follow itdo i speculate	1790.0441
all this looks suspicious they said a quarter of an hour	694.3607
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	990.6164
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber	862.3356
gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit	2371.7397
bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille	801.8481
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome	1496.6301
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud	6723.2749
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message	1140.9446
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door reopened	758.1812
give me my felt hat bernouin the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim	3342.8889
oh i confess it is all the same to me oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady macbeth either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me my jailers and my hangmen heyday madame you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening	2209.5779
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward and one at the helmhe resumed the conversation	1197.0505
a friend a friend said peppino but where is the captain there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings	2444.4272
at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the _mandaïa_ a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper	1419.5623
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we cannot tell	5466.1660
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but a man royalty is the gift of god	684.3624
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend	893.8708
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other	1684.4646
they had not seen him for two days	2261.9753
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask grimaud yes but beer asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english what monsieur mousqueton the englishdo they dislike wine they hate it but i have seen them drink it as a punishment	1939.2544
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo	652.7760
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored liquid	907.4487
de saintméran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	4557.3374
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	2197.5510
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends	1226.2404
what is the matter said the count	146.9875
but make hastei cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	2510.5247
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a _priedieu_ all its furniture	5059.4434
m she then turned towards the avenue	757.4440
on the contrary stay monsieur dartagnan your agreeable company will divert me oh oh thought dartagnan	3020.9846
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian oh i shall always love you	940.1440
what does he want with me	110.7390
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the mainsail five minutes after it was down and we sailed under mizzentopsails and topgallant sails	4604.4224
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia	815.3450
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	2435.3188
in whom can i trust place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger but i must write oh yes that is indispensable	835.8776
de villefort passed on to his own room	4922.2222
you would not have me marry under such sad auspices my child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future	6807.3745
they came nobody knew whence but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they came	2774.3350
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession to whom tell m	5670.7837
but what has become of m	834.4130
noirtier stopped him at the lastnamed sum	20180.4941
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate	2470.8213
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	1380.3535
forward blaisois a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank	1363.1761
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persias sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor	3187.3499
de villefort her devotion to the elder dantès	1646.5168
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say	1427.2925
indeed madame you believe me too credulous confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage i invent nothing madame i create nothing	1882.9286
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me bah exclaimed monte cristo thats a fine reason to give	2155.1545
la chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la trémouille i wish to speak with him this evening your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la trémouille and myself nobody by the faith of a gentleman tomorrow then sire tomorrow monsieur at what oclock please your majesty at any hour you will but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty awaken me do you think i ever sleep then	1979.5623
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself	1057.8900
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass	2119.2222
monsieur porthos monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife	12742.2881
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box which box do you mean asked the countess	1468.3477
you have only to wait here till i release you dartagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal	1480.4513
ah is it you dantès cried the man in the skiff	574.5377
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to dartagnan	1992.4746
mount my lord said dartagnan to mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding	2732.4836
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun	2117.2405
not the least in the world replied bonacieux	14667.2637
andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully not badly by any means said the young man i was born for a diplomatist well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive	1236.0890
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	1002.3417
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draughtall these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici	3474.6921
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	1460.6562
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the first	553.2990
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment	6274.1548
i shall follow the counts directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out	1996.6632
my lord i think we are in bad company a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand	680.4957
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it his threat completed the intimidation of the host	644.4496
athos stretched out his hand toward her	1432.2449
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	3568.9612
he listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three days	725.6422
yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to planchet who was not in livery	902.2014
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto	3721.9570

de villeforts yes said maximilian i recollect the project of which i highly approved well said valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it bravo said maximilian	2266.3025
at his mothers ball he danced once with eugénie and m	4490.0938
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but dartagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down tonight upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur dartagnan to the end of the world	1415.5627
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed	680.2416
it is then a service which you propose to render us count asked anne of austria after a moments silence	2200.3906
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of dartagnan	225.4443
what are you looking at asked dartagnan	2788.6912
now look here i want something to eat to eatdo you hear are you hungry come you understand me what would your excellency like to eat a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place bread	1870.8885
to him who is called the comte de la fere it is i said athos and what is the name of the person grimaud ah exclaimed athos turning pale	1227.4940
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him	1138.1956
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead	2819.4385
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me	1974.7352
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart adieu count said the abbé dherblay i return to my convent adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach tomorrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening adieu gentlemen said the count i am going to sleep twentyfour hours i am just falling down with fatigue the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look	2602.4739
_pardieu_ cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa	2089.4121
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves	2339.0579
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them	3015.0469
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched	972.5797
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse	2205.7629
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m	2067.8860
monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	2209.4292
do you wish to go on the water sir said the sailor	468.8701
bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it	1657.6403

athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	1238.2362

you will hear again from me come come thought dartagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good school the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word the queen standing near the door dartagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away	2389.4275
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal	3394.3240

there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul	1706.3070
years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of dartagnan at no rue des fossoyeurs	2230.0203
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	1591.7626
he is dead villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy deadand so soon too yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you monsieur and madame de saintméran died as soon	2146.7207

dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner	1888.2550
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him	791.0414
and you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your will yes and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently	1105.2637
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dantès efforts	17261.4062
put it up again my friend said dartagnan	570.9818
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries	2428.4851
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently	1617.0413
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution	888.6529
i am not in any want thank god my living is suited to my means	4553.5010
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service dartagnan i shall be grateful to you all my life very well	819.4563
the other room near the library was a bedroom	2566.4744
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage	977.8893
a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way	348.4481
groslow said aramis the devil who is this groslow asked porthos	2112.6318
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant	1391.9701
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart i have been heavens substitute to recompense the goodnow the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea	2204.3225
well sir exclaimed mazarin whats the matter	7140.0708
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges or desdemona	1697.5367
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho	1907.0953
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets	5767.4790
aramis my good friend this time you are wrong interrupted porthos	2377.2991
to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help see sections and and the foundation information page at	5252.2104
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly	1400.6355
i am anxious to see that young man nearer and wherefore aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that i am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man in beauty or on the contrary asked aramis laughing	1071.2971
have you not yet divined who he is what cried felton heagain healways he	1723.1504
i do not hem said dartagnan there is some truth in what you say ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court but you speak of him not of his party his resources it is truethe queen is for him something in his favor but he will never have the king a mere child a child who will be of age in four years	812.7381
read it obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him	1358.7839
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards franz are you m	1822.7993
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st cloud opposite destréess pavilion	3901.0574
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean dartagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	3699.8350
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flowerstands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantlepiece the countesss smellingbottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orangeflowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber	1845.9320
she is gone said he she must have returned to the louvre you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out no replied bonacieux with a selfsufficient air she is too superficial a woman is the young guardsman at home i do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters all the same it is well to be certain how so by knocking at his door	913.5351
what is become of them you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day	1001.2335
dartagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and dartagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a huntinghound in his old masters company	836.1129
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	3855.2263
very good signor pastrini said franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage what as to the carriage exclaimed albert	1178.9709
he delayed presenting himself at morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him	1435.7184
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon	2183.3618
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	2840.2146
it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris a manuscript in folio endorsed or we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii	2412.5044
what say you to that monsieur du vallon he added in a low tone to porthos	3288.6589
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv	1505.4703
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly	1598.5459
for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her at the hotel de ville my dear fellow what at the hotel de ville	1070.5260
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up	994.3072
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices	2619.3821
no said dartagnan no i confess it	1716.3286
roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell	6119.2065
now when evening came dantès put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it	965.0009
my lord excuse me i speak as i can i restrain myself	1816.2471
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in paris but in venice	1292.1589
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms	8977.3408
listen madame and recall your remembrances	41015.0586
but athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty	1713.0115
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing	3409.4978
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with	924.1779
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsfrom lord ruthven to countess g precisely i was sure of it said morcerf	3418.0242
not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes	2313.6079
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	3248.8140
in short said dartagnan this has been the will of god it was not i who killed him said athos in a soft low tone twas destiny chapter lxiv	1036.8099
la rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and ambition	1227.9396
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man	1646.6064
all my researches have been useless	76593.7031
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them	4544.1440
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris	14329.0137
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling	2627.4780
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris	838.7527
on the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising	4767.9839
madame danglars is ill said villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage oh _mon dieu_ said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smellingbottle i have mine said madame de villefort and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward	2288.0159
i thought i did not mistake	740750.3750
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	415.5718
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering	5458.4722
your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits what cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance no for it would be useless	2652.2634
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress	1491.8556
bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to monsieur replied bertuccio it leads to the garden and pray how do you know that it ought to do so at least well let us be sure of that bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden	1234.3373
in gold silver or notes half in gold and the other half in banknotes if you please said the count rising from his seat	1298.0479
is it not so eh who knows	2902.1470
have no more concern about me i exist no longer for you any more than if you had never seen me must aramis do as much as i madame said dartagnan deeply piqued	903.4127
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	1572.6727
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	987.8121
as i told you my dear morrel m	8945.4375
i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment	1844.8716
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice	4566.1860
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and davrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child davrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish	2519.0002
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other	800.9589
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you sir sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies	1189.4944
one of them stationed upon the top stair naked sword in hand prevented or at least endeavored to prevent the three others from ascending	3546.4697
and towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said morcerf turning pale with anger	6860.8506
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes	793.9349
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood	9493.6240
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart	1609.4310
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard	5391.6333
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys command	3774.9670
what is to happen said porthos	3314.2341
he knew his time wellthe hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty	1282.9099
he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwells letter	1118.7146
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been dartagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man	409.6500
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their features	1727.6665
what are you going to do cried mme	3754.2051

the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving	6597.6440

so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st germain	1446.9851
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color	3747.4302
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	837.3773
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else	1545.3396

just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears	2711.5762
now for the tallyho athos threw himself into dartagnans arms	13060.8691
i am lost said dartagnan to himself	371.6218
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	2704.0977

he listened to know whence this sound could proceed	7287.8984

well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman and then he was called fernand only fernand fernand mondego you are sure _pardieu_ i have bought enough fish of him to know his name then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me what oh nothing ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego	2432.3467
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the counts manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum	793.6745
it was necessary that dartagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber	1610.1956
this time it _was_ the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience	2374.5981
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife	1817.5179
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	1292.8073
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	7366.3413
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you	414.5219

i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses	1686.7803
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	1006.2134
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	2559.7964
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	2526.5969
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning	5471.0371
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat	1422.6211
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé	2053.6084
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity	86919.5156
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate	1211.4401
and must i lose the one to save the other	874.1638
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand	764.3452
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone	1719.0110
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis	2574.3848
at ten oclock every one was in his appointed position at halfpast ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day	2587.0735
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	957.3076
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	1295.3187
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet continue said the queen	2591.1191
avenge me of that infamous de wardes said milady between her teeth and i shall soon know how to get rid of youyou double idiot you animated sword blade fall voluntarily into my arms hypocritical and dangerous woman said dartagnan likewise to himself after having abused me with such effrontery and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill dartagnan lifted up his head	2711.2000
dépinay and the following day the contract will be signed a deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved	2377.2095

indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it	3150.7568
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night	4839.7490
where is your master you monsieur dartagnan cried grimaud impossible grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak ah monsieur it is silence grimaud contented himself with pointing dartagnan out to his master with his finger	2554.3301

you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw dear child said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye	3245.4727
and now said the abbé read this other paper and he presented to dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond read as follows ing invited to dine by his holiness content with making me pay for my hat serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara i declare to my nephew guido spada ried in a place he knows the caves of the small essed of ingots gold money know of the existence of this treasure which lions of roman crowns and which he ck from the small ings have been made ngle in the second tire to him ar spada faria followed him with an excited look	2339.3145

he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by vampa	1812.5623
dartagnan related his story simply with the omission of names	502.3231
de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters gladly said albert let us calli love him chapter	4257.2739
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m	1505.7195
the _pharaon_ he cried the _pharaon_ whatwhatthe _pharaon_ are you mad emmanuel	11039.2109

madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project	1303.4285
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered	2293.1318
i rely on your friendship to assist me beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart contempt my friend	2315.7017
while monte cristo had begged the smellingbottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars	1361.4878
ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable	1507.7765
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table	1650.4133
the horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon	1447.6904
the best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said dartagnan	980.3937
one has never the last word with such a man	791.3961
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	4095.2542
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or lost ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all i can understand that said dartagnan	1925.8776
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession you gave de wardes a meeting on thursday last in this very room did you not no no it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if dartagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted	1036.8372
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prizemoney manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall	1529.1089
we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it but alas it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption	1235.9410
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and dartagnan	712.5486
the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent	1737.7388
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs	4319.2056
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	1434.8950
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt	894.1906
but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question	701.2032
de la trémouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his hôtel	342.7763
go monsieur duke and return often	20596.9746
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling	3313.8579
but now her position in life is assured continued caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused	3925.7676
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	1506.7092
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door	5642.6074
it was situated in a very private spot	16405.0605

yes sir a whole bottle if you will drink my health willingly answered the soldier	2612.5264

if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	1267.4286
but let us wait a little and reflect	2189.6550
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m	1619.6572
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m	1726.5200
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais that is all i wished to know said the queen	911.1680
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside	2573.6606
dartagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	1320.1060
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan	1594.6631
dartagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking halfpast eight	3140.9165
it is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at tarbes	2370.0134
but we must be going the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm	3697.7432
all four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	1828.3557
what is this wait your reverence there is a letter you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body	1467.8716
it will be happier i think than ours has been	3342.1143
danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry	2071.1663
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror	1613.7914
then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of forges they stopped on the road but you continued yours	1558.2548
the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations	1575.6421
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your love a second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman	2019.4711
valentine the nightlight continued to burn on the chimneypiece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water	1739.1099
dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor	988.8603
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in and what of that	467.1716
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	1217.3372
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de voiture what does you mean by boor michon said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came	2835.1809
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m	926.8121
yez whats the dream said the swiss	3151.9409
dartagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	2095.0439
raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud	3571.8181
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine	2681.9312
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrels entrance it was again opened for the count	1362.5516
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it	1229.0555
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	1058.6586
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twentyfive thousand	1649.2734
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	1678.2272
m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	1461.1899
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	1656.0482
he grew pale and red alternately and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost	896.2840
the movement was executed in silence and with precision	1083.8782
morrel was seated at his right hand danglars at his left while at a sign from edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable	2000.9369
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of gods anger ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilians face	2347.2454
but he does wrong to use his privilege	20325.7793
the queen rest assured we shall not see her and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal immediately	652.1957
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another	1642.2310
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france yes yes i know what you meanthe railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair ten millions do you think so	1467.5399
mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance	8275.2441
you are not angry with me not the least in the world till then then till then bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick pace	1755.9957
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning	548.3030
i mean to ask if you are married ah as to that no replied athos laughing	835.1943
you know something of that as well as i do i think	255.7211
do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing	359.8066
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring	2773.8284
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimauds hands but grimaud shook his head	4068.0334
halloo la ramee some one la ramee ran in haste to obey the call	6004.1880
and did you catch any of his words i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect	774.8304
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him	2024.2955
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened	2193.1074
you would love me then if you were not queen madame say that you would love me then i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped	766.4474
porthos i doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly	1958.9193
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away	3699.9902
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes	12583.2119
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand	998.4606
just heaven what have i read cried the duke	1819.0839
the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea	1970.1942
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire	2162.5168
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling	6569.3345
sit down and let us talk it over milady murmured athos	9228.6826
three days since you were with him in normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best friend an ironical smile passed over alberts lips	3856.2522
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for	1075.3593
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	885.2411
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	1333.7563
speak my child speak said dartagnan i listen here	1668.3032
what brings you to paris affairs of importance which you shall know later	2043.7710
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for gods sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us	1120.0548
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julieemmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count	1842.4944
this morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of repose	2656.4910
the nails too were turning blue	39179.9766
dartagnan was worn out with fatigue	28382.7324
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts _chasseur_ also	2934.6880
the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them no but we shall make use of them said dartagnan	1370.0968
very well come this way dartagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through	3181.9832
but you expected some one then asked the officer	2315.6829
a circle was immediately formed around the door	902.3958
bazin gone the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be sure that nobody could either see or hear him and opening his ragged vest badly held together by a leather strap he began to rip the upper part of his doublet from which he drew a letter	2400.2749
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos	1153.5155
he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman	1070.5377
the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cæsar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals	1891.3945
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my motherinlaw and madame de longueville	1934.3301
whither are you taking me asked he	943.1515
he is going to fall cried morrel	5387.5371
madame de saintméran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m	1154.9961
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours	7020.8652
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover	978.9727
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop	3732.0586
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner	907.3565
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	1733.9496
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	3642.2971
not another step he said or you are a dead man what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other who are you inquired the sentinel	1751.1960
de boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape	1248.5961
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified	7514.2090
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	1962.1118
_pardieu_ monsieur said athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman	1284.1315
dépinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m	1358.0592
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy	1066.7964
well be it so at length said eugénie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is i see him the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty	1066.0774
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath	794.5336
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino	3322.1833
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	1469.3892
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand	1869.2103
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by dartagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution	2199.5083
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf	1834.0681
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports	2787.9932
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself	1535.9078
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling	2196.7549
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him	650.6691
yes we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois as you know and we are going to give mazarin something to do	1328.8663

it is singular said dartagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i cannot yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised anchor	1140.5948
my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct	1972.2998

madame resumed athos two of my friends named dartagnan and monsieur du vallon sent to england by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france no one knows what has become of them well said the queen	1797.3148

what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this	7859.2402

it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat	3061.8845
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution well then i will content myself with arresting you madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by tomorrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and delbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him your pardon madame i know all that	1172.4962

no the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst ii have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable	2266.4485

but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawingrooms the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young ladys diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly	1208.3379
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock	1426.0088

noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	1482.0532
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief	2064.8098
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m	2705.6453
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before	3351.1848
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	13229.1641
then he had a moments hesitation	158259.3750
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg sainthonoré	4698.2104
a bad joke of the husbands substituted the other but the husband has been punished since and i have obtained full satisfaction planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds	4628.2573
_ma foi_ said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m	826.9805
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	5767.7539
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind actively to work	1491.2454
albert sprang from the porters lodge to the steps	2030.0518
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealingstake your choice the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs	3327.7070
then i saw that they took me for the assassin	525.1662
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guardship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them	3171.7368

no one can deny his being a noblehearted young fellow but meanwhile continued m	6295.6660
de saintméran advertised it for sale two or three years ago m	7329.3770
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention	4517.3071
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the _concierges_ door and which merits a particular description	2734.6382
monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared	1067.4198

it may be supposed that dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal	1318.1534
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you	735.1165
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood	1382.1865
the cavalcade trotted on more sharply	20727.1055
we shall require it yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	2640.2925
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of _la jeune amélie_	1407.0564
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his buttonhole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush	2269.1150
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	2355.7246
bravo count bravo it is frank at least said morrel	3072.5349
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources	2309.8799
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him	2409.9980
de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans	4058.0520
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart	1280.4463
i will restore you to liberty this moment i will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue i will name you the lucretia of england and i will say that you are the sextus	607.8939
my god he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually ali looked at his master for further instructions	3089.2913
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital yes monseigneur you came through meung where something befell you	3963.1174
the steps were already down and the door open	357.8262

he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing	1294.8068
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal	991.1881
but there is nothing which would donothing m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help	3496.0649
de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court	2042.7383
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo	1742.3728
devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said porthos	3100.3000

i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative	2644.4553
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon	1908.4882

the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	2299.8159
why not because he is an actor in the drama has he assassinated anyone then no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him	1380.2792
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal lower _sacré bleu_ said athos	1579.1487
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up	2167.4485
de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid	1522.7944
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty is what you tell me true asked the wounded man	1092.8861
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall	1693.0898
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	1834.5981
by my soul said aramis she is charming	1503.0925
i was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness	940.6301
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged	421.0981
no before a woman you would dare not fly i presume remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything you are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses	2344.3640
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the eventi was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east	1161.2518
monte cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all	1797.9354
ha ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they havent left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they havent left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have askedonly i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie very well sir said the host ill give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain do as you like said raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place	1260.8689
the count has only been two or three days in paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the marais is and if he does not you will show him ah monsieur returned julie it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister	1475.5074
amuse yourself well replied bonacieux in a sepulchral tone	3534.0249
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden	1896.8163
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him francs for a mouthful of bread	2138.0515
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for them	1318.0240
dartagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head	1222.9056
adieu we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness	2043.5439
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	1112.7845
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the time if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queens service not at all said dartagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost you are right sir always right said anne of austria	1052.0240
the kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom	2537.1536
but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us is not death in my house oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture	1241.4908
morrel allow me to present to you m	143.5282
caderousse quickly performed the strangers bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off the name of edmonds betrothed was mercédès to be sure	3417.3657
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah ah exclaimed rochefort	2374.1655
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety	1605.5677
i looked carefully around i was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night	2779.8743
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	1135.2367
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you yes and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison noirtiers joy continued	1292.5835
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than thathe has made himself understood how was such a thing possible by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil goodmorning madame said the count bowing	1800.6560
do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant	1029.5649
on him on him always on him yes you are right maximilian i will follow you	773.7250

pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true	2518.2976
a part of the good abbés words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home	3103.7437
as dartagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse	1601.3870
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raouls departure	3028.9236
and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in do you know him i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken	270.3725
dépinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry	3604.8994
de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m	827.9416
who are you said the pilot in bad french	6765.8682
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i cannot remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that planetree	1000.2071
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended	1200.5507
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	2593.8103
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you save my husband save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself	1545.3794
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls	2675.7446
adieu my friend adieu on the contrary said the count after this time you must live with meyou must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us and you still bid me hope i tell you to hope because i have a method of curing you count you render me sadder than before if it be possible	1234.1990
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds aramis porthos cried athos and laughed aloud	5305.0884
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	2595.8184
but have the kindness to give the abbé busoni i told you he was not at home repeated the valet	1876.4260
besides you owe me some thanks	179391.9219
he was accompanied by two of the yachts crew	964.7827
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputygovernor of the chateau	2182.4343
we know him said athos he never left the king yes that is he	541.3097

i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday	2785.7620
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him	2137.6499
what oclock is it the baron drew out his watch	4639.4731
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres it appears so said athos since here they are	3283.9922
well do you not adopt this means athos said dartagnan	1009.2479
ah exclaimed davrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery	1004.5629
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais	2683.9614
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	3077.0420
athos has been arrested yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen the arms of dartagnan fell powerless by his side	1091.0684
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast four	2550.9976
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity	2156.4663
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god	459.9733
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said dartagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier dherblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis	1311.5421
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon ah my dear m	1429.7754
the house as i said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see andrea drew the garden the court and the house	666.8962
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	3776.1733
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	1938.4824
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his doublet	1746.2655
with opium belladonna brucea snakewood and the cherrylaurel they put to sleep all who stand in their way	2092.1519
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments	2551.0886
by men of heart i mean men of courage	13048.4199
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire	13653.2559
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you yes sir answered raoul	2983.2532
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young mans head fell on his breast	1898.0695
well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament with which you are at waris it not so	752.0205
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune	2120.7456
at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bellpull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation	2971.4751
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise oh my god listen	2689.2751
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay	774.7997
he wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his mouth	1720.9982
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m	3054.3425
no he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there	2526.5476
yes yes to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief	1659.1420
the same evening all villeforts servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave	1338.4364
have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path never answered de guiche	8874.9766
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted and what was it that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes you believe in sorcerers then you fool ii mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giulio who cares about them as an italian he is superstitious the duke shrugged his shoulders	1215.0442
bonacieux the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him	802.4452
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saintméran	1679.3558
friend porthos said dartagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy	571.4996
yes we will fly i will confess all to heri will tell her daily that i also have committed a crimeoh what an alliancethe tiger and the serpent worthy wife of such as i am she _must_ live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage	2028.4020
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third	941.1743
it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athoss eyes	1261.8180
franz thanked the count for his attention	2485.5583
but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass	1215.2452
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his breast	1168.0431
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire why said danglars in the letteri believe i have it about mehere he felt in his breastpocketyes here it is	1402.5610
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him	1394.9688

bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband	721.4132

dartagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them	1558.0875

the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m	1522.1578
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo	1240.5707
i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days	2200.1692
andreas hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time	1314.2786
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence who are they replied the duke	1179.4506
towards the evening of the third day	18938.9180
he turned round it was danglars	59093.4609
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk	626.4576
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it	1900.9634
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor m i did and you followed the business of a tailor true i was a tailor till the trade fell off	1299.5745
ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed dartagnan	9019.9658
no it has been stolen from you stolen	742.5770
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet	967.3855
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct	7359.9165
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit	1945.4867
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france	3574.8987
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant	3206.1387
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	3045.0996
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	23231.0840
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	862.1617
a circle was formed around them	723.4449
the young man burst into a laugh	1215.8765
when they entered the port it was already night	1178.7798
it is so hot at marseilles that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever	3320.4062
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces dont be afraid	1699.4141
we are ready ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said did i not answer for them but you sir said the queen to aramis	683.1841
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal	1491.4893
from that moment he grew very guarded	19900.5449
say on you will permit me to make one remark certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction	1930.3652
there what do you think now of the affair	453.6845
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town	1254.0635
on our honor as gentlemen then i may tell you all	393.3111
de villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the lawmade man	779.8611
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose	2109.1863
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment dartagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris and did not stop till he came to athoss door	4386.4531
we set forth on our journey and have you never revisited that village eagerly asked madame de chevreuse	3178.7471
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber	1123.8431
explain it athos groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself dartagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	7326.0718
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets	4067.4788
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	1523.7947
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has refused	2263.5129
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames	1803.7919
come back sirs back the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were heard	1420.7433
but ibut i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross leap coward cried raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir said he courage we are coming to your aid olivain advanced retired then made his horse rearturned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as raoul had done only repeating i am a dead man we are lost in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	2274.1238
noirtier asked morrel while davrigny looked inquiringly	23095.4727
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventyfive thousand livres per annum	2233.4563
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart	1217.3506
what are you waiting for said caderousse	1446.0228
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me	775.2702
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded	6739.7993
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed	2164.9705
the storm broke about ten oclock	5889.9883
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself	9110.1074
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly	4497.1992
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all god abandons him who abandons himself said milady	3251.8611
it must be the son of mère simon who has stolen them i saw him strolling about here this morning	2758.4451
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes	1736.8889
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	2486.6750
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london	7542.3022
behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door closed	1468.3505
one by the post madame danglars footman left the other let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box	2804.6699
you meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics	7936.3364
we should command an annuity of livres	920.3357
excuse my not coming to meet you but added he looking at dartagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me no has the host told you nothing then i asked after you and came up as soon as i could porthos seemed to breathe more freely	1131.8563
here he said take this pocketbook do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison	1059.3939
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs	1085.3739
yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for i know the fact well	552.0537
do you wish for a name	2413.9565
for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mothercountry as they have preserved its language	2279.1250
this village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half moorish half spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their fathers	3385.7275
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud	4541.6440
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling	5219.9429
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos	1702.5360
milady was only a queen while among queens	35521.2109
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the _pharaon_ is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars	1145.9712
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin thats all very well replied dartagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh	1858.5096
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head	3809.7556
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game	2942.9993
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbé smiled	978.0436
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel châteaurenaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m	2421.5183
well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy tréville thats impossible it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom well sire for once he found his master i will see this young man trévillei will see him and if anything can be donewell we will make it our business when will your majesty deign to receive him tomorrow at midday tréville shall i bring him alone no bring me all four together	1304.4214
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii	53294.9766
do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count i shall do whatever they do at paris madame if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement are you fond of horses count i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east madame and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two thingsthe fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first you see madame how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone	1627.9204
eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak	6595.5806
_diable_ when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father	2042.8074
where shall we pass the night he inquired	1975.2635
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society she must go there whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert	2058.4868
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance	1746.1880
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	702.3862
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	1559.4254
alls well he cried as he entered i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow	1879.9932
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence	1463.7192
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything	2160.9119
m here is your chamber for tonight said he	603.4615
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des fossoyeurs near the luxembourg	3387.6848
it is my happiness my treasure my hope	23688.6895
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	921.2705
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	1250.5940
for life replied porthos in the same manner	2683.1704
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think of whom pardieu of monsieur de bouillon my friend i think that he is much troubled with gout you noticed that i didnt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit you did well you would have caused him an access of his disease	1071.1873
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	1810.4701
haydée said he you well know why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young greek	2508.6890
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	1646.6779
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat	1826.9447
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances well said andrea let it be as you wish	2311.5413
was i not nearly your husband m and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd	1522.0453
they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies which means which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen	1655.1941
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	7243.9595
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the hôtel de londres	1955.5287
set out for naples the hague or st petersburgcalm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hotheaded parisians	6147.3936
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative	20737.1289
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory	1991.3225
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition	2380.8838
but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently or so boldly the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes news on the spot entrance at all hours into kittys chamber which was contiguous to her mistresss	1883.3560
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens	8616.6279
each examined his arms and put them in order	1721.2649
however to teresas great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening	2019.8370
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	3691.9995
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum	1972.1578
but then he may have stopped at saint germain i dont think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette i was there this very day and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling	2441.7200
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue	641.2500
then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees	2883.1646
_non capisco_ do not understand was the reply	566.4792
sign it then caderousse signed it	209.7726
was that all he said inquired athos	2057.4771
will that do my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks well then said athos it is agreed	1667.2781
ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse	958.7123
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	2514.1282
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens	2226.8516
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke	1303.5055
the shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence	1435.8903
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	2458.0723
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	4823.9624
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance	703.5839
you foolish fellow said athos laughing	7713.0229
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit	1742.0995
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no in the avenue des champsélysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps	976.0962
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers	1171.6216
certainly there are people whom i love	991.9706
it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	823.0457
he rose however as they approached	51792.8398
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are and you asked joannes	1481.3629
say to her peace or war my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	1257.9192
dartagnan looked attentively at the building	12642.9941
and what was this mans name danglars what rank did he hold on board he was supercargo and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts good again now then tell me was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere no we were quite alone could your conversation have been overheard by anyone it might for the cabin door was openandstay now i recollectdanglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal thats better cried the abbé now we are on the right scent	1823.8773
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind felton has not told him said milady to herself	1412.1163
so dartagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply	2242.4460
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	1420.0294
she believed the order ready for execution	2829.6206
they dont have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt this time the musketeers did more than shudderthey almost cried out	1729.6769
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance my good edmond answered the abbé be not deceived	2420.4700
well then madame yes i did feel fear and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i cannot count how many charges and skirmishes i own for the third time in my life i was afraid	2420.5635
you may one day be the captain of a vessel	358.9026
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii	37518.2695
yet i let him die what do i say	278.9741
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	390.4811
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m	2490.3892
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	353.8244
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	2052.4668
dartagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said dartagnan i decide that we should adopt athoss plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus	2150.7659
dartagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning	8957.6279
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see what asked athos	2044.9222
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me	476.5504
he had a heavy handdear old athosafter drinking dartagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman	1687.9993
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	756.3125
here it would be dangerous the house may be watched	1185.8568
no fifteen thousand are not enoughi cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs no replied andrea dryly no i cannot i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly i said without your laying out a sou do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortuneand yours with mineand both of us to be dragged down there again it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	2466.3320
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity	1353.9442
he strictly followed the instructions he had received	563.0008
bills upon his majestys private treasury answered dartagnan who reckoning upon entering into the kings service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood	4114.3066
beware i have warned you but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him	1929.2701
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead	589.4020
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters grave	1150.5721
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave monte cristo returned her smile	1540.1394
and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	1383.9843
noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me	3632.2273
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day	3018.6318
i recognize you perfectly the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion	3759.8230
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation	1626.2220
the four or five remaining hours before nine oclock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visitsdesigned to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankers in their gayest equipagesdazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative	3111.6626
m how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared	1110.8341
is that monsieur said dartagnan to himself	724.4892
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then	1445.1543
if while he was being carried out the gravediggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose	1874.5712
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired	2227.4612

you do not like dantès i never like upstarts then tell me all you know about the catalane i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries what have you seencome tell me well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin really and you think this cousin pays her attentions i only suppose so	1961.6619
we shall both get into trouble	142857.8125
had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him	4470.6865
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles	3443.6758
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived monsieur you insult the majesty of justice not at all said athos calmly	1794.5787
oh dont let that disturb you cried mme	2430.1382
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances epilogue la rochelle deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year	3205.1450
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keenscented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat	4175.2095
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure	8888.4111
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerfs i will await her return and beg her to come up here	1647.9983
and i am madame héloïse de villefort the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time	1161.6555
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of dartagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders	2961.7737
i reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	2723.4846
eventually she was obliged to leave france	40870.9375
this young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition what occupies him in england he is one of cromwells most enthusiastic disciples but what attached him to the cause	1546.8546
endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether _we_ return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not my child returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flowerthe flower falls from the tree my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young my father had a long white beard but i loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life shall i see you every day then what do you fear my lord you might find it dull no my lord	1522.6587
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile	1652.4513
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	826.9154
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness	6734.3252
a man the discussion is going to begin again said mme	2955.9834
a gentleman and a diplomatist then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist	848.1538
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent	2048.1924
go on dartagnan spur spur and he fired two pistols	4549.6768
morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owners hand m	1237.4884
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel	1602.6979
i am a great captainthat i am but i make war in my own way the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley	1859.4351
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate	1012.1647
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed	10266.3965
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château dif he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	1870.3408
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him	651.5095
de villefort of the impertinence of his servants madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from m	1837.7581
you cannot think of going out in such weather as this oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller	938.9447
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur darminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two grooms	1750.4723
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately the two friends went toward the shed	3759.8555
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor	1979.5461
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river	1669.7716
the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it and have you replied to everyone as you have to me ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones were you at the opera yesterday no he was there ah indeed	677.1633
were you not already rich enoughyou who possess nearly a million	8170.1895
the château dif cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled	1508.7812
but in this world we must risk something	31584.5410
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room	1094.0280
dartagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume	12201.0459
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean he went to find aramis	1422.5065
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care and what is her name haydée replied monte cristo	2183.3564
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid the queen smiled	702.2760
i must know what you mean to do said she	433.0694
you held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards me	3391.4507
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	3654.2483
then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders and on one of those lovely shoulders round and white dartagnan recognized with inexpressible astonishment the _fleurdelis_that indelible mark which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted	2775.4187
molière had not written his scene in lavare then	3579.9480
so once more goodnight caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	2679.3374
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord buckingham	658.5819
he was called count he was said to possess livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme	3333.2717
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc	2880.7913
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	3247.8535
the officer entered for the fourth time	6410.2261
no no i go i depart i believe in you and i would have all the merit of my devotion even if that devotion were stupidity	799.5176
at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	2304.4902
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france	1073.7007
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense	2715.7505
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades	1892.8147
by me what was his name lord winter your uncle exclaimed cromwell	12563.7139
yes that is the very boy hes patronized by bazin ah yes i know of what importance is this little reptile to you asked porthos	3088.6372
ah ah gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings	2983.8391
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	1781.2085
he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the counts box at the argentina and valle theatres	1245.2908
de tréville who detected him at once	2565.9824
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every respect the color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger	2384.3604
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	1612.6160
the warm pressure made dartagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself	3318.2285
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces	1805.7454
wholly yours aramis dartagnan tried to recall his remembrances	6234.0386
and i du barthois added porthos	3233.9668
a better idea however came into her mind before going to bed	3839.8921
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	2480.9414
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed you are here in the apartment destined for you madame	802.0569
but he said the counts generosity is too overwhelming valentine will be satisfied with my humble fortune	4103.4443
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name	541.3825
ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box	1259.2635
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom_non bis in idem_	1155.9261
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather sharply	5779.1733
must you know all absolutely and rather from your lips than anothers muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword	1476.3590
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent	359.3927
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover	6975.0635
do not leave me you see i am dying dartagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her	1051.9489
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	3341.9995
_ma foi_ yes though he was in his own element what do you mean the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists great is truth muttered the count fire cannot burn nor water drown it thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimneycorner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge	1787.6105
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	1976.4922
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at least	1865.3602
ah why were you not there gentlemen	21104.6504
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	2540.4148
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers	1502.8116
i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos and the travelers continued their route	3391.2793
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	4105.5229
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	817.6631
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their soninlaw	1196.2015
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	2677.5547
the dying mans eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive	1739.2948
oh if that were so i should lose my reason and he folded her in his arms	1010.9000
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance	2477.4480
the fowl had not been poisonedshe had died of apoplexy	4199.0645
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it	3364.6636
i have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse	1792.9032
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand i maintain my original resolution very well my dear sir then i consent to cut throats with you	982.1001
at five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune	5074.9360
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme	1782.1549
no madame if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied athos	1516.6819
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lovers arm	2946.1880
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	2023.9056
de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon dartagnan	1982.1182
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter	1021.0395
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul	1293.5206
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	1454.5802
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	2984.8694
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girls mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her	1518.9769
now dherblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached dartagnan	3467.4197
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur when you please said dartagnan	659.1647
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman	2668.1003
there is the true reason idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it out but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment	615.6605
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared	4337.3550
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	1507.3552
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantèsthe latter of whom attracted universal notice	4805.5908
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate	3295.1638
well monsieur he is still here ah _pardieu_ my dear dame said dartagnan springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life where is this dear aramis	2537.9824
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances	2448.6152
ah i have come now to what is most difficult speak speak one can say anything to me	1298.1432
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwells permission	1624.0677
the count of monte cristo had just entered	3185.8728
where am i and why am i here	597.9448
he had received in the chest the bullet of dartagnans first adversary	4633.9194
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	2964.8896
it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about livres yes to whom do you desire to leave this fortune oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	1475.1979
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so dartagnan saw that he became pale	1026.5011
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	1674.3408
the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome	2823.1812
in fact dartagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests	943.7778
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite	6712.2173
she is not dead demons do not die so easily	2015.4519
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness	2061.5054
and here he comes by jupiter galloping through the bushes the count the count cried a young voice that made athos start	1613.3228
there placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland but still on english soil the tents of a little army extended	2206.4036
you must have had enough for today	3744.5400
come he said tis a warning from heaven	11162.6084
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf	562.3148
we must never look for discretion in first love	4489.5801
not if it were my own brother cried dartagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm	2964.0300
it was time for the jailer was coming	8122.9917
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	757.6452
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	1532.0106
of danglars yes to be sure must i say baron danglars	5025.8281
davrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier	580.8355
dartagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de trévilles place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey well i am in a maze said porthos do _you_ approve of what dartagnan has done _parbleu_ indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it and now gentlemen said dartagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for allthat is our motto is it not and yet said porthos	1144.7325
come porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business nothing good replied porthos	1761.4132
say rather crime replied the doctor	20064.8145
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug	1836.3635
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another person and who is that other person asked milady warmly	1503.7371
i was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me danglars reflected for a moment	748.0022
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially	1891.9556
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses i have no horse said dartagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de trévilles that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine one of yours how many have you then asked dartagnan	949.0936
oh mon dieu no nothing at all	730.8295
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him	1219.9673
to the visitors room said the same voice	1140.8712
no but gaetano did i thought gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone and if this person be not a smuggler who is he a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree what is his name if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name sinbad the sailor yes and where does he reside on the sea what country does he come from i do not know have you ever seen him sometimes what sort of a man is he your excellency will judge for yourself where will he receive me no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel	1338.5902

as for dartagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pommedepin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him	1445.7933
what has become of monseigneur athos asked he	2340.8364

noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	20891.7227

olivain said athos showing the servant raouls shoulderbelt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low	5889.0225

beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice	902.9476

what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that dartagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheardof things which were taking place	1231.1125

whats your business here you hussy dartagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak	1547.2980
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of dartagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing dartagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other	2136.8643

so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage	851.7390

for i am sure the count is his father	849.8035
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m	3501.7041
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	2201.1389

that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham	960.1516

the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities but once again that gentlemanwhere is he	946.7323
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	1027.9470
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them	1618.4529
repeat your fathers name said the president	1516.3839
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned dartagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	1337.6045
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him he knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it by whom by me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information and what did you reply that i had none as yet but that i was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some you told him that said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face	1147.2057

i comprehend now you comprehend said porthos	587.7013
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	2259.5369
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	3489.5762

madame de villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but i cant be severe with him he is really _so_ bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m	1812.8086

feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline	1695.8087
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	1142.3425
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out	1113.6647
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it	1152.5286
you have continued your course of villany you have robbedyou have assassinated well i should say if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble	926.6049
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an adder athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	5737.2515

the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill	4862.0845
take it and there ends the matter what cried athos are you selling my horsemy bajazet	1549.6726
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son	327.0468
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands	1057.7388
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened	3061.0085

it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the ministertoward the subordinate and the master	712.0130

this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner	669.3411
m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	1985.8048
there are twentyfive bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my fall	1456.2361
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	3707.8496

the king had not yet returned from hunting	5728.2144
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended	1736.9038
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said dartagnan	1049.6960
the two friends repaired to athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them	902.8890
is he alive and at liberty	272356.1562
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo and who is beppo oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle indeed you are a provident person i see why you see no one knows what may happen	1491.5483

a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	1811.2128
good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him	1936.6650
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queens army	2519.7559
it was a pledge a remembrance	64254.3867
ah that is really original said beauchamp	3955.8411
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone	972.6757
noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strangethe father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics	1536.7913

valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help	1139.6353
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor	2594.3608
de tréville after having written the letter sealed it and rising approached the young man in order to give it to him	653.3456

let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance	1846.2278
for a mind so perspicuous as that of dartagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	892.3850
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m	1028.1476
i thought i did replied athos but no doubt i was mistaken and he returned dartagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it	1087.0774
it appears the conquerors had something else to do well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man porthos nodded in sign of agreement	2537.1897

have you a name then i bear that of your brother ay but you are mistaken	1058.1322
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	1864.3954
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever	1871.5095
there was but one tavern the post	618.2219
all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise	2173.5330

he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	7214.6929
_pardieu_ said villefort he is a noble fellow	6872.1860
stop sir look yonder he whispered dont you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows	4430.0146
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant	1367.5532
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve oclock	6336.8799
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur	349.5463
oh no there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu i dont even know their names yes but in regard to myself my lord it cannot be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence you think you were i am certain of it ah stay i fancy i remember it	1097.8654

m the third act passed off as usual	5152.9819

go away now mouston so hes called mouston thought dartagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	6736.9844
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	3435.4490
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal linesgod knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc dangoulême themselves watched over by the cardinalan inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days	3273.2832

consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m	2069.9509
he still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest	1589.4803
on the doorsteps davrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others	3245.6799
is he still amusing himself in italy i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely	3496.5483
athos aramis and dartagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender	3977.0239
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey	1372.1498
a man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones	4193.6177
m oh he exclaimed as though a redhot iron were piercing his heart	4173.1870

he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii	6356.4663
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet	3017.8518
porthos looked at dartagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions gascon sharpness continually supplied him	3207.6921

as mademoiselle de scudery remarks scarron and raoul laughed	15438.9014
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance	1362.1294
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	1793.9353
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed at what	834.9818
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs	3527.7249
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal	2307.0168
do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not perfectly well my good friend and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the _i_ or rather by naming the persons	1359.2947
and you monsieur du vallon yes you sir speak if you please said mazarin	3015.0554
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you and you have me my lord	649.1437

you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the counts voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased	1727.5519
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine	1857.0835
on being left alone with mme	73879.2266
you think then said he that i am taken to the château dif to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m	1356.3552
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m	1097.6826
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door	869.2498

you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already	1111.4318
morrel good worthy man said caderousse	10023.7285
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there	2200.7095
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	662.0182
ah cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend i am a gascon said i only when i succeed the answer pleased him and he laughed	978.8685
dont you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage	2557.7964
but his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos	1385.6801
but when he saw the carriage take the way to la grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the hôtel de ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with him	1513.3444
do you mean at rome i do ah then i suppose you heard haydées guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie	3127.9224
display is not becoming to everyone m	7414.5854
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage	1949.2670
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take i have his letters said she	544.6741
franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert	4273.5693
de morcerf yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion but your house is not m	850.8362
i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches chapter	3156.8535
on guard milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy	6115.2690
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations certainly and that is why m	1097.8768
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted	1339.1240
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands	1290.4471
whom does this belong to he inquired	494.5412
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury	2386.9575
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis	2512.9116
you are a man of taste	90026.0234
let me see your plan i dare say it is a pretty one why not	693.2343
how sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majestys shoulder	1491.9786
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited	1873.3237
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine	2720.2659
leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage	1774.3057
no but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted dont you think so dartagnan i think so indeed cried he	886.5059
shall i tell you each ornament of your toilet	3306.8525
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiègne and all is over madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold	2909.2881
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years well in spite of that dartagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her no indeed said dartagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance you see then dartagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is athos said dartagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven so then said athos offering his hand to dartagnan	1085.7109
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty	1998.8400
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out	1649.5361
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest	2392.1089
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him what did you refuse to dine with him said old dantès and did he invite you to dine yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son	1541.8876
it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong	3402.4978
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the fatherinlaw i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn	943.9983
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following	996.8560
but since you possess that virtue why the devil dont you make use of it with respect to her majesty	1868.3192
would you like to become rich or at least independent	9085.6748
this was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board	1946.0054
the guards were under arms and dartagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades	458.0127
in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at	1945.7892
why what good would it do asked caderousse	8199.0850
de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m	772.1265
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo	1850.5870
dartagnan was a woman and still more a mother	2762.2319
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty	4660.7285
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the kings musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain	1345.9983
in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor	1669.2390
do not be angry we can try it caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut	1324.8721
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what oclock it was he was shown monsieur de chavignys watch it was then halfpast six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised	3168.9128
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé	4326.7417
impossible what do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed yes she was married asked aramis	2450.6699
morrel and then ran on to mercédès	1401.8910
towards the house the chestnuttrees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air	3116.2241
mercédès extended her hand to the count	298.3573
we are for the king and the princes added athos	738.3178
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	1301.8402
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing	2032.0905
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled	19418.3887
it was there a lodging was prepared for them	925.7053
zounds he said i dont suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i dont know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee	1730.9772
the two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	3753.1311
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	1106.2628
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this worlds affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east	1679.1677
ah said dartagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	3597.5430
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	1023.9375
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes	2368.7751
an instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings	1256.3564
is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence	2358.0723
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming the puritan then went out	2086.6362
for all evils there are two remediestime and silence	5175.1436
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly	4344.3389
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir	539.1505
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows	1548.6495
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament	1184.5880
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people but i warn you i shall defend myself even against you you are right said milady	1562.8824
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to dartagnan who pressed it respectfully	1345.8513
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again but how did the accident happen asked raoul	1859.7268
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach	1663.4633
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison	1828.3130
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says	585.6267
you know he has estatesporthos i should think so indeed	1318.0454
at the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people athos shuddered from head to foot	3522.6047
but be assured my dear monsieur dartagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself oh i dont doubt that replied dartagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of armsa certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities	1537.1379
oh pray be assured of that franz took his hat and went away in haste	1713.9895
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word	3341.5947
i havedoubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter	2508.7488
and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed	2945.4590
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the halfhour	1874.5247
the count alone seemed unmovednay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks	5154.1567
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte cristo	1638.2477
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him	2321.5957
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years	1798.9670
yes admirable _prorsus admirabile_ continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers	1748.7828
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	3470.4531
speak command i will obey morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening	6639.2456
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin	10741.4365
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo	3543.5320
with two companions yes replied the duke	1121.6348
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity	4156.7432
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams	5308.0337

from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer	1153.0453
i would lay a wager he has stolen it do you think so answered dartagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity	2148.9729

franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a restingplace and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many _ignes fatui_	2384.3525
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	943.7507

oh traitors that ye are sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman	760.3788

no for another for another yes his name his name cried dartagnan	816.1043
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	1507.8153

but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france	1075.6942

now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table	3658.7292
dartagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy	17108.3359
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep	8847.4863
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none	1934.7534
debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain	2514.5886
morrel i didnt dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you how singular murmured maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrarywhat strange feelings are aroused by politics hush cried valentine suddenly someone is coming maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it	2035.7012
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé dherblay and in spite of bazins assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion	1881.2343
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the rd m ah said monte cristo the evening of the rd of june	1669.5232
and they pursued their road in mournful silence	6286.2051

and madame de saintméran her mothers parents who both love her tenderly and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m	2366.1638
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old	1458.6337
i cannot believe it murmured the banker	1316.4965
ah it is no then yes valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns	3485.0962
danglars asked for a knife and fork	1582.3047
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested	879.7911
de morcerf into the drawingroom said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase	2247.5930
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer entered	2371.0273
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage	2008.7511
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating	602.8121
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm	2564.1172
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment	624.6038

the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m	935.1035
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	3767.7559
it was empty and dantès emerged from the tunnel	3223.1348
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawingroom where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs	3758.9878
oh queen queen you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that	1871.0884

this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès	8710.4521
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	1859.3855
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward	1347.4277
he arose and stood near mousqueton	103806.4531

all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur dartagnan is doubtless true said the queen but i have confidence in you alone	980.9511
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me i have also sent for the procureur he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing wait a moment said monte cristo	979.0674
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace	2457.9023
you had begun to pervert my poor felton	3007.4426
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched francs then these francs said mercédès shuddering	2462.8992

indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	6528.5698
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders	1746.2379
a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrière saintmartin	1945.8402
you look careworn really you alarm me	2397.9023
i do not remember if it is exactly francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference	1339.2798
but what can be the matter	69591.3359
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	5254.0991

the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore i will not speak more fully now	1740.1152

but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	5763.1680
the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg sainthonoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchengarden of about an acre	2888.0520
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act	1339.1879
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door	2112.8584
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down	2039.5594

then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal	317.2399
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactorthen count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols	2062.1128
to what do you allude monsieur said danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals words	1677.1448
which route must i take demanded dartagnan in his turn	1276.1733
thank you said monte cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going nonsense say on well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together what is it a telegraph	1109.5674
the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door	993.0729
the eight guards were at their posts	40192.4219
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers	1288.4857
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue you are stupid replied the cardinal	1622.9297
the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers and how far back into the past do your recollections extend i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners and how old were you at that time i was three years old said haydée	1878.5145
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside	3590.8179
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his coat	1192.0591
i want friends i want faithful servants	78854.5312

have you seen him i left him five days ago said dartagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston	2495.9541
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but morehe is one of our friends no madame replied raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle the young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor	2071.5298

morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	3113.4436
it followed that dartagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsathos porthos and aramis	1576.5049
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry	2115.6077

there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently	3616.3762

twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth	8842.3076
at that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared	2679.1868

julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian	2244.5352
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars	3267.2046

if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution	1587.5905
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie	4458.1309

villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three illlooking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frockcoat and hat with broad brim	1631.2438

soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god	921.9152
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens	1542.1588

provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	3298.3643
châteaurenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	2968.8550
arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road	3195.3237
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly not well then and so he is in paris yes and what effect does he produce why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle marss diamonds and so people talked of something else my good fellow said châteaurenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	1537.1335
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	1149.6146
see said she if everything does not second us here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are	2999.9946
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence	1161.2534
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	2272.1392
well whats the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man i ask you if you recognize him that manwait a bit ah i see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of bethune the former executioner of bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired	1428.7081
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed dartagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthoss adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramiss had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead	1154.8683
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	1056.1627
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story	809.1701
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	1447.7567
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bankbills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	2062.2917
monte cristo wrote i die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon no quick quick said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti	2181.9453
de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation	1281.6937
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up true monsieur le comte replied dartagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	1413.5284
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château dif and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers	1007.9004
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oclock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and dont you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the _barberi_ who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell	1020.9221
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge	3569.9961
where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly	1748.2683
yes and who is the man i do not know why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ballroom to find you oh said the countess to franz go with all speedpoor young man perhaps some accident has happened to him i will hasten replied franz	875.2607
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared	825.0706
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze	1303.6683
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	582.6747
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visitingroom	829.0004
although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss	1358.5463
oh my god my god cried mme	13251.3115
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered dartagnan shaking his head doubtfully	906.5504
planchet dartagnans valet supported his good fortune nobly	14870.2188
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true	1180.6052
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemens coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door	1441.4401
the history of athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong	941.6969
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it	935.9207
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte	1564.5125
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day	1159.8484
each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passersby through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note	4895.7808
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris	1551.2533
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness youre a great moralist and thats the fact said porthos	3477.8716
i hoped your house would have been some other one than this as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination what what cried monte cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter	1253.2499
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m	2022.7903
follow you cried bonacieux follow you at this hour where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance	1236.6843
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman	1136.5453
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom	1153.6085
it was as we have said the st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness	805.1127
the joy of the king was lively	2018.4854
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said dartagnan	2637.8020
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray	2354.1963
did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing	4955.7446
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death	2136.2080
oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees	3262.1267
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an underlook at the count the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity	2373.6292
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	1521.9117
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	1654.9147
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss	1169.3438
you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta	3499.4341
it is true she said the arch hypocritesee i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces	1637.5409
oh it is not yet fixed murmured fernand	29139.3359
of what country a frenchman your name edmond dantès your profession a sailor how long have you been here since the th of february your crime i am innocent but of what are you accused of having conspired to aid the emperors return what for the emperors returnthe emperor is no longer on the throne then he abdicated at fontainebleau in and was sent to the island of elba	1472.4753
through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all but true parisian as he was bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the lamps	1014.9228
you say sir said the king	3456.1255
there are many stories related of him and among them this	285.7333
ah stop i have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to me tell us allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders athos made a sign for his lackey to approach	2655.0422
no i do not jest _mordieu_ i should like to have seen you in my place i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied dartagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm	1228.2441
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles	1148.9143
here is what you are looking for he said	421.4741
so that he told me that poor monsieur maillard go find the coadjutor friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir say then father bazinthe heir of monsieur maillard the giver of holy water at saint eustache hey i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms all the same i should like to do him that servicewhat do you say to it i will tell the coadjutor said bazin	1237.3085
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal	597.2452
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid allwere it my life oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments i also have had dreams	1987.3499
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart	5298.7329
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister that is a strange question said aramis	935.7592
i ask pardon of your eminence said dartagnan but i was so fatigued dont ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service dartagnan admired mazarins gracious manner	3077.0359
it was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night long	3284.3870
his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbé faria had been	2714.2397
oh yes returned monte cristo i make no secret of it	736.9285
i cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis	1913.3995
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent	2802.7515
they are two hotheadsthe one a gascon the other from picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately	4003.0742
bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m	375.4411
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon	1761.6273
they set out after a run of two leagues mousquetons horse sank	10345.1611
she with a stillsmiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone	2797.2747
we left paris each with seventyfive pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure i think not monsieur unless something new should happen well a pleasant journey thanks monsieur dartagnan left m	3332.1433
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets thats because they dont see us said athos	3277.7783
leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible	2211.0608
_morbleu_ said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet _morbleu_ i wont be their dupe i will answer for it	2099.4192
dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thinga grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury	2660.7734
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned	1890.3334
he is going to turn his house into a _badhaus_ as the germans term it	1193.1976
m but at least you will be there will all paris be there oh certainly well like all paris i shall be there too said the count	1008.6547
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird	755.7891
come come with me gentlemen exclaimed mazarin	27132.0840
in fact the rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before	2273.2759
one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selims flaming lance	2313.2878
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same	1009.8781
in consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his visit	955.2069
is this carriage for me said dantès	1134.1583
i have now to confess to you	27.7981
are they made to order precisely said the count six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness	2645.7393
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	1099.3159
you leaned upon my armupon this madame i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot	1963.6130
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost said dartagnan	1078.2197
i married exclaimed monte cristo shuddering who could have told you so no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince	1005.8709
well then let us say no more about it said dartagnan and let us burn this letter which no doubt announces to you some fresh infidelity of your _grisette_ or your chambermaid what letter cried aramis eagerly	1858.2598
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment	1682.2732
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m	1717.9121
at last dartagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and dartagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	4730.9785
everything conspired to prove to dartagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened	746.5615
are they paid yes tonight let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough i have nothing more to do with them nor they with me	1466.2668
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one cant entertain	3345.9573
morrel still alive yes replied caderousse	10940.1699
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall	1997.3945
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family	4121.9531
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall lyons will hasten to welcome him	1877.9835
everyone is free to ask what he pleases thats true replied jacopo i only make a remark well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them no said jacopo but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers that is all i want interrupted dantès	1042.6622
do you find yourself badly lodged sister	34349.9883
whom would they hang yourself or me	218.7825
i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen	1051.8932
no i have good luck that is all	84.3474
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart	1053.1309
at seven oclock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled	2452.8516
dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain no maximilian i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my fathers house where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself	2446.5461
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathit does not come alone listen	3892.7883
i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly	3279.2322
i mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it my friend said gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attaini mean the remission of my sins the war will not only be approved of but directed by the church	1070.2285
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone	3082.0610
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speechwhich embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be freeso fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and thisthis is my fortunenot chimerical but actual	2190.1008
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future soninlaw excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you m	2602.8535
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin	1792.8270
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme	3185.3352
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish	1228.8903
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	613.2015
he then repaired to dartagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own	1077.4478
i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	1260.5552
poor edward is as much m	1021.8207
but for the sake of the mother said the count	238.7923
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m	4661.2354
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell	1070.1188
more dead than alive he looked around him	2268.2192
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back	2552.9468
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	1952.5387
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper	4786.2075
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	881.3229
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m	1473.9603
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared	3355.8542
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the _chefsdœuvre_ of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora	3704.7356
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position	1712.6562
the count de guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by raoul who came to wish him goodday	2000.1804
i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject	496.1206
go then animal said the duke but remember i only allow you half an hour may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau my lord yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment	1599.9872
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door	403.8684
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and dartagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning	1791.8015
where were you born continued the president	1230.0851
you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting do not fear i have little to prepare monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation	2302.6733
dartagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion	4667.0845
nothing replied the latter only if the queen has the studs which i very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to hima cry of admiration burst from every mouth	1162.3470
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window	2473.6423
the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cables length of shore	2435.6079
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond	1952.5890
the soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon dartagnan called the sergeant	1294.8956
spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence	1603.9158
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet	2780.2229
this must be then an affair of importance and what is the most important affair to a woman of twentyfive love	1155.8501
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters hand mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain	1948.5254
in the place of the palais royal dartagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens	6384.4434
listen replied felton in a low voice	7675.1387
he found tréville in a joyful mood	27689.6797
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him that will be for another time he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah monsieur de richelieu would have said five hundred crowns for the councillor well lets say no more about it	1117.9979
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself	1053.8024
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength	3318.6714
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes planchet began to sing un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin je crois quil gronde contre le mazarin	10927.5215
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced	1091.6356
de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto	5425.9976
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	4249.6558
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly	5856.5493
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man	591.3822
fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends	1633.1007
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner	685.0667
besides let me own something to you	25.0605
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias	1679.1925
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first	1488.0084
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	3651.4197
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine oclock galloped into the yard of trévilles hôtel	1833.7323
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	2903.3621
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it	514.2332
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered	1195.1815
porthos said dartagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me oh good heaven said planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen i will tell you all about it replied mousqueton	1358.7418
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard	1613.5667
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it but you will not make me your confidant maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret	1072.7023
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	1158.2014
he is my master and i am his slave he has the right to notice nothing the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy	1367.1836
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed	2213.5208
you must be cruelly bored here that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you whats that it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventyfive pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice	778.2203
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	4758.5493
dartagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself	2699.6553
without doubt he recognized dartagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	3371.1548
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side	4822.8491
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as alberts prison and franz and the count followed him	1215.1497
are you not going to put up at the arms of england yes sir are you not charged with a mission from his eminence cardinal mazarin yes sir in that case i am the man you have to do with	855.9794
do you think so sir certainly	44281.6289
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance	2960.4832
that i think is as much as i shall want but your companions i dont think they can be in need of any	1256.0911
i know that name a son of monsieur de broussels servant and a lad that i promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs is he not a singing boy at notre dame asked dartagnan	1305.1611
has he built one here then no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise both the deuceand what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	951.5124
at last dartagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing	1145.5374
now then go go in the name of heaven i was expected at sharp midnight and i am late by five minutes yes but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages when one loves well and who told you i had no affair with a lover it is a man then who expects you cried dartagnan	1196.9724
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner	1546.5103
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball	852.4968
remember we are waiting for our turns speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted aramis	5311.2241
at last he heard the voice of la ramee	4147.6074
then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your heart	2177.5942
come then said the minister i will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied dartagnan	1497.9324
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	6591.7573
she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hands	1383.1589
we need not add that the goldsmith oreilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any pretext	2828.6843
monsieur dartagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live	1385.9464
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses	1975.2843
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead	1652.6609
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg sainthonoré	1725.6501
as certainly maximilian as i now press your hand i shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow morning morrel in his turn took monte cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was	2540.8933
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	2581.3953
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here	2665.4517
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand	1143.1566
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him	890.1555
poor fellow remarked danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	716.4701
as soon as the door of gondys study was opened a man rushed in	1279.1270
come continued dartagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice	1149.3082
i dont think the sides are equal impossible for three reasons replied athos	3825.8413
de saintméran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin it was morrels turn to become pale	1888.9899
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could	1732.0498
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the customhouse officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aiguesmortes	1464.0054
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercédès nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	2917.1880
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france	1235.9788
albert besides being an elegant welllooking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscounta recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris	2700.0942
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	3700.4419
dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them well when dantès was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad	2524.9023
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care	1396.7139
very well cried i then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb	268.1823
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	2145.9050
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you withyou are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king	2462.7078
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach	1891.8708
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	553.5499
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	1974.2504
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture	563.2366
porthos had discovered the means _the diamond_	36340.8633
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere	3870.4001
planchet turned and returned the billet	29667.9043
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante your emotion has quite overcome you his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear	2080.5083
you are free tonight without fighting so much the better how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin	3114.4592
what was most pressing was to get mme	5292.9497
good dartagnan is for mazarin he said to himself	316.3728
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune	2205.6431
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate	1628.3699
madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other	1335.1842
remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said richelieu significantly that it was i who came to seek you and that i did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you i shall entertain whatever may happen said dartagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your eminence for that which you now do for me well let it be then as you have said monsieur dartagnan we shall see each other again after the campaign	1043.0580
well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting	1422.8755
now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going	1732.1448
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also	1749.9373
dartagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently	665.4481
de morcerfs who is deceased for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired and what are they to live upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army m well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs	2898.7764
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i dont doubt	1916.7235
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am well said comminges suppose one thing i will suppose anything you please suppose there were a window in this wall well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his the count then is in the chateau yes for what reason the same as yourself athosa prisoner you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison dont let us play upon words sir	1845.2455
de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted	2070.4709
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m	3585.7910
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine	2326.5815
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him	1908.1987
the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided	4834.1353
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse	1167.2308
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	1128.5295
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean	2381.9832
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m	920.1878
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	1730.4193
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings	850.7652
the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles	1021.1198
at that moment he cut it	72.2330
pull down the blinds said dartagnan	501.3802
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace	1825.7090
so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m	2506.6934
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flagstones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance	1816.2020
let us be on our guard oh my dear dherblay who can say whether dartagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal	1651.4729
let me see it said milady	100887.1719
he took his way toward the hôtel of m	300.9251
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror	3035.7688
yes for the mothers sakehis poor mother cried the major taking a third biscuit	7378.3711
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop	1048.8765
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder	1053.2599
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl	1802.6594

a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation to whom does this island belong to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile	2028.2880
my fathers melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m	1191.2596
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	1400.9235
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	1117.7681
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man	1020.4734
hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse as he thus reasoned monte cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie	5155.8477
as for porthos on whom dartagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute	1268.6348
you to interminable ineffaceable infamy you repeated i	2779.5417
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top	1953.9283
i think i have sprained my wrist said porthos	1190.6610
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	962.7460
ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room	1170.6599
besides mother remark how vivid his eye how ravenblack his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkleshe is not only vigorous but also young the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts	3094.7791
fortunately morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came	965.7590
oh yes that is well and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket	1271.4963
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor	849.2813
that is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the chief cucumetto cried luigi and teresa at the same moment	1103.8806
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments	13877.5107
dartagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the chateau du vallon	1741.9325
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier dartagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known dartagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos	1905.5410
the two friends were in the via dei pontefici	12623.9707
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous	976.4412
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him	1400.9181
scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation	1457.9258
he approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and dartagnan could get no hold	1595.9281
privately yes well i will remain with you at this moment villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came madame de villefort	1647.5269
morrel alludes continued châteaurenaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories	2647.3660
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas	1519.7500
what said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after another dartagnan felt the truth of this reproach	5020.0942
eh he said negligently this money is not mine	1380.7393
see him and hear what he says m	1216.0515
bonacieux and then when bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city	1626.0685
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage	2633.0593
all this she owes to dartagnan without doubt	3561.9839
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said dartagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force	2724.9878
it is a veritable army my faith yes said athos there they are	1217.4934
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people	2422.4341
oh thank you a thousand times but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage a smile lit up the old mans face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face	3114.7207
this is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall wellmade	4036.4182
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden	539.0713
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth dartagnans confidence stopped there	2034.7211
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said	1516.7904
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me and both with free use of the spur arrived at st omer without drawing bit	2903.2473
m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights	2106.4885
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	893.2654
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said dartagnan	578.0593
read said he read i cannot see	9819.7793
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand	7078.9951
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs	2461.4773
ah thats it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony we are going to fetch our brevets said dartagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them and where are we going asked porthos	1798.6172
well here are francs on account the majors eyes sparkled brilliantly	9990.3076
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of dartagnan	1633.1677
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos	985.7587
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god	3285.2639

he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one	703.9061
tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of goldcolored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue	1991.9626
god forbid besides repentance becomes the guilty whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god guilty	1766.9535
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	1413.3248
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation	3053.2417
bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible	29012.3379
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of limetrees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south	2632.3337
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m	2853.5847
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as i am that you have met with me for if i leave this place welli have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal	1730.9021

the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabitedthe only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count	2346.8091
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	2095.4915

you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglarsso be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned	1896.2177
this woman is certainly a great liar	43449.6250

after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate	1274.5052
