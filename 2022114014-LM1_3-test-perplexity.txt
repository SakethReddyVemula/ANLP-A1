i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans	314.9417
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond	235.2381
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman and then he was called fernand only fernand fernand mondego you are sure _pardieu_ i have bought enough fish of him to know his name then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me what oh nothing ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego	522.4948

the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle	151.1824
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	375.0759
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why	180.6832

the marquis de saintméran i think the concierge said	141.6347

the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the kings attorney	269.7012
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird	100.7705
well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting	161.3537
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description	92.4294
dartagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water	688.2371
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	126.8342
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat	350.6667
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for dartagnans embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i knowyou with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent kingyou my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as dartagnan porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right athos arose	379.7031
i insult you said lord de winter with contempt	43.0386

monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen	334.9469

i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks	349.8281
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dantès and i only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to you the sweat started forth on dantès brow	568.1491

the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers door	114.7524
grimaud came rubbing his halfopen eyes to answer this noisy summons and dartagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey	711.5911
the duke was at windsor hunting with the king	711.0111
we discoursed a long time madame on different subjects of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous _aqua tofana_ of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick molière or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand at this moment the clock struck six	421.0485

the horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon	576.9877
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph	311.4121
whos there cried caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands	183.5519
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it	225.5032
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twentyfive thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild fiveandtwenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	274.6721
has he gone intending not to return undoubtedlyat ten oclock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton there a postchaise was waiting for himhe entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau then what did you mean stayhe left a letter for me a letter yes read it and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray	267.8603

he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action	232.1339
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away	351.1292
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen	517.0284
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around	427.4032
i am not like you viscount you like your title do you not certainly replied albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied danglars	322.9133
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twentyfive years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	216.7868
saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom	6242.0161
père pamphile more wine and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table	483.0290
at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor	177.6824
in an instant dartagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes	188.7295
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon let me do what i please and do you what i do they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses	427.1475

ah mother nanette cried friquet suffocating ah mother nanette he could say no more but though he hadnt strength to speak he had enough for action	1100.9006
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer	98.0711
literally the basket because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle	2704.0188
yes i did waityes i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me	211.7283
albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his buttonhole	757.6275
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	286.8545
all has gone according to my wishes	179.0160
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful sit down in mercy dartagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge	217.0350
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips	243.7770
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man	348.6722
then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation	122.9840
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet	345.0862
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter	1159.7776
maximilianemmanuelif we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room	114.9696
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation	224.0892
oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal	594.7775
dartagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume	282.1761
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	357.4776
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars _née_ hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	1472.2927
maximilian morrel said she the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect yes said the old man	196.6519
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed	198.0054
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade	238.6182
and now once more adieu said morrel	60.7701
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	890.7801
danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker	474.2918
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea	857.4141
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door	1485.6100
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	298.3902
dartagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent	1967.6030
with every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slackened	521.9746
let us see i have told you	17.6781
you can see it in his eye	109.2147
and the guardsman dartagnan still my young scapegrace	37852.6133
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin	198.5137
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister	383.3712
leave him with me replied the duchess	36.9491
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	695.1486
marie michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest athos paused	533.6066
who wants me a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal and who wishes to speak with me who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne then let him come in if you please oh my god my god cried mme	121.1515
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me i shall not be more than half an hour and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him	129.4703
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr	219.4920
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	124.2581
i live there during my leave of absence continued maximilian and i shall be together with my brotherinlaw emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply	195.5273
de villefort your brother has been the victim of this	50.6395
for i am sure the count is his father	121.0581
is that what you wish for said barrois	155.5122
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect	110.5633
dartagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	396.8626
i will sit facing stuart whom i like so much to see especially where he now is and you monsieur dartagnan opposite to me athos turned red with rage	244.7021

you are then in possession of francs asked the notary	76.2997
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron grasp	1482.4426
they opened it and found francs in bank scrip	314685.6250
tomorrow by twelve oclock i shall have the order for your exile signed _buckingham_	999.0764
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	75.8558
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy you madame said dartagnan affecting surprise is that possible my godgood and beautiful as you are a mortal enemy indeed an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death	228.0846
are you one of us monsieur de rochefort i am very desirous of being so my lord but i am totally in the dark about everything	102.4445
the officer entered for the fourth time	151.3123
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost	172.3791
but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards	21531.6191

but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed	325.6288

besides the king i am certain awaits your majestys reply before risking anything you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himselfmore than he hasobliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king	640.6782
follow me then said the abbé as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès	145.6869

his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker	109.5700
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard a great misfortune m	500.2602
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke dangouleme were called the petitsmaitres	673.7498

see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray	667.5657

you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here	131.7821
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	131.3307
he then repaired to dartagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own	223.2889
do you know that i die tomorrow at ten oclock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment	152.3757
come continued dartagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice	116.0598
all my researches have been useless	904.6210
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar	852.0042
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them	946.9684
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other	308.8408
madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy	231.0096
i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure	311.1655
i know that it is terrible said dartagnan but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blowsi can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there	341.3691
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos	89.9167
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled	13489.9570
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him	215.9818
we know the counts vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man	722.3288
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice	91.3401
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos	252.4309
now i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly	1170.1654
alas i do not madame rejoined mazarin	24258.2910
did you come from boulogne demanded she of milady	988.1160
i always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased minds	4476.2456
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	775.1057
a loan nothing more after all i am not an unreasonable man	248.8684
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered	159.9793
in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me	354.7831
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his fathers grave but then he had the woman he loved still remaining you are deceived morrel that woman she was dead worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed	216.8717
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of dartagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated	562.4504
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	311.9983
come the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristos door	289.0940
i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow	177.5826
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed	275.4508
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose	126.0769
fortunately you wont be laid up more than a fortnight	105.6686
we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people	550.2256
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words	250.6496
gentlemen said he if monsieur dartagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur dartagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal you have my word monsieur and here is my sword this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find her what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly	149.2897
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will	109.7699
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to dartagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer	363.2645
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	2754.1880
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him	239.9749
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says he is quite right returned beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he does	323.9030
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	314.8189
laporte place the king in bed laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet	106.3357
de boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape	455.5959

here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room	227.5245
oh pardon me sir i can scarcely realize so great a happiness	502.7554
no one would have thought in looking at this old weatherbeaten floraldecked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	3395.4670
it is a little worse for the journey but thats no matter there are no horses albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	105.9516
disarm him onlymake sure of his sword	85.9007
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weaponswhich were very beautifulif not with envy at least with curiosity	249.1234
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti	1227.1932
he was armed at all points	3850.4421
yes replied dartagnan from this very day and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find better we must use and not abuse said aramis sententiously	347.0099
the fact was that emerys son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed	287.9868
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood	1235.6628
no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation	2571.2554
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone	246.3430
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside and the young man went to the gangway	3065.1216
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself	305.4667
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer	124.2134
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	107681.6094
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	131.9509
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors	371.3147
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket	326.2459
lord de winter is only her brotherinlaw i will see her dartagnan beware athos beware	411.1120
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together	8710.9834

although dartagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercers pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart	476.0115
albert rose to return to his place	83.1430
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	113.3347
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at dartagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look	525.5162
it was the signal of a visit	171.2907
madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them	1345.0692
but contrary to all expectation when the st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	420.3969
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	235.3684
but what can i do for you then dartagnan told m	122.5139
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars	109.0339
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another	223.0960
he was masked likewise but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity	434.4034
my dear bazin said dartagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger	215.3486
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos	408.7791
the event was announced by the cessation of the firing	662.7538
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after	234.2137
grimaud moved as if to leave the room	75.1524
dartagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	216.6123
he reminded me of it telling me if i did not pay for you he would be paid by m	63.8542
bravo and you are not afraid of that athos no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest and with regard to the past asked porthos	106.3641

impossible said dartagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward	13561.2891
we lost five men and the rochellais eight or ten _balzempleu_ said the swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the german language had acquired a habit of swearing in french	750.3417
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host	737.9303

wrapped in this sweet idea dartagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment	244.1404
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty swordstroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair	258.6073
on reaching home dartagnan found kitty waiting for him	209.4974

my father died but i did not die	27.8884
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied dartagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia	1443.2771
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his selflove immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	394.8081
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him	76.3329
he is i think the son of general dépinay he is the same who was so shamefully assassinated in by the bonapartists yes	430.6935

the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed	442.5933
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	619.4893
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle	231.6633
dartagnan but that till that hour he had been at m	84.1106

he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living	462.1562
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that dartagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence	154.4105
he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within	252.4825
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her	144.0237
once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction	3259.7134
well in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear monsieur groslow for i can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it not without my defending it said groslow	176.3232
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell	88.0609
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in she passed first	159.9037
well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and i should become rich	392.5687
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same	347.2251
he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered hold your tongue said danglars	1455.5779
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	582.5330
do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of _robert le diable_ and when the fourth begins takes his departure chapter	1067.3358

you see said he calling dartagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my domains all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied dartagnan	241.3106
edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration	876.0031
and the troop continued their route	4174.1265
valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will see valentine seized the counts hand	225.0091
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold	142.6251
i am afraid he has turned out ill she added	652.8130
de trévillethe counsels being thrown into the bargain	105.1197
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	872.8600
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes	153.1510
the soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon dartagnan called the sergeant	1002.5931
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow	267.2448
ninetenths of the english people are horrified at what you say this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser	304.1205
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite	4867.0391
now planchet has an excellent memory and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death	231.9302
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted there was a moments silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror	624.7623
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth	633.3451
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	1292.2002
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught	173.7845
in that case felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary	3500.5522
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself	660.5142
dartagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	180.8955
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos	136.8996
i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villeforts ball shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked franz	557.0297
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal	709.4519
the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity	180.0899
he spoke in a voice of the procureurgeneral with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law	390.6638
he remained there some time alone	755.1151
just god he muttered whence comes this thought	1753.0992
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste really	1682.3630
he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux	235.8486
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman	277.9890
bertuccioyou are going to stay in the carriage then	42.9041
as to dartagnan he took care not to give the least sign of existence	150.5508
what is this rent said he showing dartagnan a place where it had been pierced through	228.8223
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	1282.9099
powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saintnicolas the city hall designed by puget the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebière	1787.0309
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	338.6706
and now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn	212.9397
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	846.3383
well then well do our best having said that they went out of the stable well what matters all that to us said dartagnan	109.9152
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps	492.5490
towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached	1400.7170
youyou said the young man looking fearfully around him	5135.1152
why should i leave you that is not for me to say but we are now about to mix in societyto visit and be visited i dont wish to see anybody but you and should you see one whom you could prefer i would not be so unjust i have never seen anyone i preferred to you and i have never loved anyone but you and my father my poor child replied monte cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you i dont want anybody else to talk to me	162.2403
the man somewhat crestfallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said	539.6821
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was over	318.1523
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman	84.2272
dartagnan dartagnan cried she is it you	61.8792
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france	110.1958
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm	521.6745
why the devil a horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy dartagnan did not smile	1780.3160
but how do you procure a light oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind	405.5612
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons	7151.0693
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery	461.7879
but on my soul it looks so	787.7888
well then marie michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i dont know how you could become acquainted with all these details a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas	248.2765
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing	413.9613
who is there answered the voice of her he sought	170.3116
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared	59.8181
a surgeon reverend sira surgeon said caderousse	68.3780
here we are said the gascon	91.2396
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle dartagnan and porthos obeyed	321.8578
morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality	762.9502
is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words	177.4961
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams	249.7517
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church my dear bazin you ought to perceive said dartagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly changed in everything	223.6135
dartagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurators wife and dartagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortunethe best mistress possible	378.6057
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	5680.7651
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent	448.2472
this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions the public astonishment had reached its height	243.8654
eat heartily grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it	127.3224
planchet waited towel on arm fourreau uncorked the bottles and brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters	2825.1379
de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine wellgrown girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat	1258.7365
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits	135.4229
begone and may god guide you amen cried the young man and set off at full gallop	128.7057
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room	1293.7415
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door himself	53.7198
good heaven you have more experience than i have	234.5588
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish	1921.1412
he cannot pardon her the history of the saraband	291.3857
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	292.3965
de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers	362.4644
it is gods pleasure that things should be so the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce	577.1289
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	200.6696
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	115.0418
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis xiii	185.1741
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	285.9547
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england	107.6935
and what have i to do with your illhumor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these things concern me	482.4740
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoners escape	388.2209
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i cannot throw you out of window for three weeksthat is to say for twentyfour days to comenor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed	1025.1168
what is there then behind this wall	129.5121
it was the marquis de saintméran	53.9404
i am a gentleman born and my blood is warm as you may have remarked my dear dartagnan	111.8866
the two things agree marvelously well i am all attention said dartagnan	59.4364
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trapdoor in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen	313.7726
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages	4040.5122
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	221.6211
one day as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre he was coming out as she was going in and she showed him to me the devil the devil murmured dartagnan all this is vague enough	160.7301
it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme	101.5077
i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain	171.4816
alas yes well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress and what sort of revenge would you take i would triumph over her and supplant my rival i will never help you in that monsieur chevalier said kitty warmly	333.6541
just as they were sitting down to table m	95.6756
i take them said dartagnan for myself	216.0534
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see	385.4921
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate	301.3681
to join the army under the prince count and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	138.0043
it is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty	287.0960
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbé smiled	142.4294
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice	190.0006
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fanshaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the subtropical sun	4534.1270
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might failfor felton was forewarned and that against the least chance	2039.9514
i have it with me the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure	486.5303
the promise it was indeed maximilian morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day	245.2572
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced	190.4408
dépinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with albert and châteaurenaud	647.7696
yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him the two young persons exchanged looks	212.7372
de villeforts antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name	124.0823
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayvalentine has been assassinated villefort hung his head davrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes	170.6837
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another mans fortune	222.3873
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire	151.8062
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of yes it was i so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth condescend to listen to me and you shall know all i listen i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers	192.9628
in the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded	414.0239
andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though wellpleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle	483.5424
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them	74.2299
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy approaching	1857.1428
but what must i do asked milady	249.3775
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne	364.4338
i wish to see him at once ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight you think so yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you m how long has he left it two years was he liberated then no he was put in a dungeon listen said dantès	184.9096
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse the three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	163.1198
well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten days of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus	915.9463
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course	1246.9391

ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured dartagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence	272.7235

they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and m	146.9927
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment	632.4449

beauchamp that you are more sober than he was sir said m	352.0012
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune	316.7742

then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn	693.8891
we are for the king and the princes added athos	111.7528
almost an impossibility replied the major	235.2383
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrestedfor we have friends in parisbut we are contented with another course	255.7650
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you you know what i have done i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	177.7277

monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown	227.2245
arrived at this last hue it changed no more	428.7927
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the periodmeanness stinginess fasts but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurators wife had been tolerably liberalthat is be it understood for a procurators wifehe hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind	1385.5201
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	177.2741
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the halfcurtains closely drawn	358.4015
you love me madame it is enough i love you i yes yes	55.1985

the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house	271.6657
you have decided friend said athos	16.9102
yes my lord the pure parliament what do you mean by the pure parliament	279.8619
keep your illhumor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it	310.5837
you also stand aside he said to the masked man	298.3271
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès	197.8007
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman chatillon and flamarens started	266.3772
well said the president your name i cannot tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my fathers and can tell it to you a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand	213.5038
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio	726.4801
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle	43.7125
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you alberts freedom what influence can i possibly have over a bandit have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten what is that have you not saved peppinos life well well said the count who told you that no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant	208.9816
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for	389.1654
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with waxlights	21500.6348
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers	515.4036
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france	440.9877

ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people	105.5425
bills upon his majestys private treasury answered dartagnan who reckoning upon entering into the kings service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood	881.7134
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money	84.9406
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present	450.5231
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead	71.2493
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know dartagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul	169.1152
there is no harm in overprecaution	54165472.0000
cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars asked beauchamp	145.7659
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contrary what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed	80.7775
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful thank you madame said mazarin	96.0701
planchet dartagnans valet supported his good fortune nobly	11841.4697
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	224.2988
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend	210.6214
my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed	1116.5861
noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing	203.6397

the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison	239.1163
the overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leaders bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on	384.1461
stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms	175.6659
the gate opened a carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the steps	86.1171
it was many years since dartagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly	461.1629
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet	138.6211
there the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed	485.0363
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation hush said athos speaking in a low voice	39.8022
and alone no my lord madame has visitors have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_ no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing and who is with madamem	286.2729
allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to sleep	123.1674
with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room his shadow did the same	258.8449
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds	839.2460
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury	232.3450
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majestys service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me	195.6479
i will be an abbé if it suits me	1061.7688
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme	4446.7979
when seven oclock came dantès agony really began	63150.6797
then said dartagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do yes said athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman	89.6954
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage	121.5570
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard	175.4081
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments	372.3466
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france m valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	243.0944
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part certainly i see you are a model mentor said albert goodbye we shall return on sunday	291.3580
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me	252.8279
each examined his arms and put them in order	91.6794
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling	240.3862
if you heard the cry of mad dog you would take your gunyou would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog	1231.3456

but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment dartagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	859.5645

at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	1503.4711
no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	154.7911
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his heart	401.6908
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher and what did he do the rest of his time monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory which as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholicsall in the name of religionhe adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot	449.2259

fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirtysixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person	665.8347

within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass	404.5025

the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them	247.3737
in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life	169.5554

a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	585.4503
it was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes	203.2042
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a wellfilled one my dear madame uttered fresh sighs	1432.0905
at last they lost sight of each other	31.9611
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that dartagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind	156.1357

monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemensome coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn	245.4357
no said felton it is nothing but what then is the noise that of the patrol going their rounds where is their road just under us they will discover us no if it does not lighten but they will run against the bottom of the ladder fortunately it is too short by six feet here they are my god silence both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking	274.3430

every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine oclock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priests breviary	348.1875

fire fire cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends	537.0375
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand	201.1720
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless	202.4123
mazarin leaned out of the window	153.5296

her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her breathe you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her	106.4492
it was done on purpose for mei am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty	160.9095

if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	691.8575
had morrel been a more quicksighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department	290.4697
the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great	431.1596

i received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact i rendered him	185.2271
they rose about eight oclock in the winter about six in summer and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m	265.6583
steel is for gentlemen and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed it	1034.5150
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	321.3671

if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival	492.9905
bah i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me	373.6179
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain	9738.4746
whilst dartagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris	150.1549

you want to know how we came here	226.6765
yesif i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right	113.9113
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	286.4368
de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	277.5368
you have forgotten it porthos said he	24.4801
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great	363.8039
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove mine one instant my dear friend replied the abbé it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength	271.2679
and is not this daughter dead demanded monte cristo i fancy i have heard so yes monsieur oneandtwenty years ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the stewards utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it	604.9609
i have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to paris i know that well	221.4911

if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists if he persists said the cardinal	144.7116
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo	210.2451

he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times i shall do so if only in gratitude eh cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder	1314.8960
dartagnan came the next day to miladys and finding her in a very illhumor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m	360.2227
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wifes writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my sons sake i became criminal	224.4797
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit handsome wellbred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations how young this dartagnan is said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle	392.1898
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no just think	1317.7079
that miladys son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already the devil he is said porthos	105.9503
no door gave entrance to the room	18.1144
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results alas dear friend said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life	852.0408
for instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end	650.8639
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me m mercédès burst into tears her womans heart was breaking under its load of memories	617.2316
tis not too warm to walk resumed dartagnan	433.1165
according to the laws of dueling at that period dartagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased	296.6678
it is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said aramis	5069.3877
dartagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends	759.8851
sire replied tréville without lowering his voice in the least either order my musketeer to be restored to me or let him be tried he shall be tried said the cardinal	144.2539
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop his manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was	326.4673
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	122.3310
dartagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her offfor i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance ah said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that and my wife on her part has sworn to me by all thats sacred that she does not know	222.9129
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate	994.8749
_pardieu_ cried dartagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get cold can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his friends	117.5933
he determined to cultivate the goodwill of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present	779.8559
de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	159.4040
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road	1110.2379
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir	74.9734
this instant sirthis instant i beseech you said the old lady	53.2910
dartagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it	198.1682
my friend said andrea i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me	1150.5042
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme	145.0980
returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet	814.8716
but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes the story will be very long excellency what matter	148.7723
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	417.4556
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest	410.8429
that is the crime of which i accuse her that is the cause for which she was branded monsieur dartagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman the punishment of death replied dartagnan	113.7586
tis he it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness	168.0483
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of belshazzar	2266.7273
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria	87.4511
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion	112.4890
what with dartagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them	856.5486
he had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay	169.5373
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity	205.9318
oh i see you prefer peregrination	53692416.0000
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested	126.5140
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh	246.4464
in his youth dartagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word	498.5209
either we shall be attacked or not	74.5806
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthoss long cloak and dartagnan rushed straight into the middle of it	310.6595
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking	616.2209
toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court	496.5705
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was	85.5969
but i will take the left handit is my custom in such circumstances	2019.7234
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his fathers enemies	210.2724
endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king	56.8847
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty what has become of him	477.6830
oh all this is a family history as châteaurenaud told you the other day observed maximilian	488.2990
hold see the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands wait wait said the duke	416.6786
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here	245.6904
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saintméran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	54.8982
from that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it	46.5094
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz dépinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of m	796.7474
athos was introduced and announced by name	4298.5112
bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door albert was used to the counts manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the counts orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house	117.8618
the house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea	246.9329
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort	332.4589
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord	318.6537
dartagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief	185.6995
the _pharaon_ left calcutta the th of february she ought to have been here a month ago what is that said the englishman	76.2599
debray is with madame danglars nodded his head then turning to monte cristo said m	69.1499
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make	1380.3127
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semipelagians but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head	640.1667
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started	222.8671
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i dont know who for my part and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in a tremulous voice	164.8334
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other	399.6161
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous teresa gave him oneonly instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo what exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his _mocoletto_ from him was a lad of fifteen replied peppino	565.3679
are you asleep that you dont answer when i ring and dartagnan heard the door of communication opened violently	677.2191
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans	97.1115
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall	96.4848
jacopo will carry you to leghorn where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar	545.1244
monsieur porthos monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife	35.0903
what a disgrace to us oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too an excuse for us to meet dartagnan with a false excuse to have to make a false excuse to porthos oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	372.1119
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name	233.6887
where were they taken asked athos	30.0086
i have replied dartagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table	59.5078
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain at the moment when the hand of the massive timepiece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door	369.9531
dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain no maximilian i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my fathers house where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself	759.9974
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	102.6215
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same	629.6218
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance alas said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all that for me i well know my sweet girl said dartagnan	276.6351
consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m	142.7651
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink	475.7852
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish	340.1492
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you today and tomorrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor brousselall that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance	2492.5205
his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityin fact the application of the axiom _pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you_ an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of _knowing others_	1698.2072
good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door	113.7291
only as our gascon was not easily intimidatedor rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fearhe placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty	565.0095
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	197.5758
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety	137.2821
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension	947.3031
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	1065.0870
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons but i love her my lord and was jealous	182.6878
pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word _unlimited_ in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo	1306.3790
he is waiting till your majesty is ready i am	56.8265
de morcerf and is justified by his son had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless	340.9161
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	277.3032
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers	598.0688
to leghorn then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind because we should run straight on to the island of rion you shall pass it by twenty fathoms take the helm and let us see what you know the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a firstrate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient	310.6960
richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can and he left the chamber without once looking behind him	378.6407
leave the room and send me a woman women are very indiscreet my sister	261.1474
yes what to do noirtier made no answer	305.6418
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his sidenot from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times	665.6887
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated	128.4654
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an _auberge_ recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man	677.9357
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the manager of the project gutenberg trademark	77.3550
what is it listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbés two hidingplaces	392.5204
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	82.9232
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile	500.4497
so i will not abandon this bouquet _pardieu_ returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_ the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his buttonhole	499.2041
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed	712.4205
the hour of dinner soon arrived	634.8134
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly	472.5896
speak gentlemen speaki am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	575382.6875
at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic	1676.7626
a lion even ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion	3004.7134
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder	126.0879
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	473.0033
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	953.7178
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her	139.8381
this was the more so because bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecolored	62398.5859
he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy	5313.7573

davrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime	378.9530

of the evil you have done said the voice	88.0236

come gentlemen your swords said the duke	15.0575
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried châteaurenaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism	399.8236
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing decidedly my dear athos said dartagnan i should like better not to risk anything thats a pity said athos coolly	233.9807

still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason	860.3895
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances dartagnan was the only man who could relieve the queens uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur dartagnan at once	343.0793

i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears	394.2954

amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos	981.4470
what the devil paris is not paved with cambric monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said dartagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions	2214.1289

the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man	34.4477

at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	247.2975
we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have francs left the blood mounted to the temples of debray who held a million in his pocketbook and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with francs under her cloak while the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few deniers	400.5597
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	266.3568
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitants shoulder	777.2375

he arrived valentine was expecting him	38.3086
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory	849.4944
keep back my lord said dartagnan	10.5856
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag	943.4871

dartagnan remained standing and examined this man	142.9498
