or he will forget us added dartagnan	102.8034

the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an underjailer illclothed and of sullen appearance	429.2096
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same	64.1176
i know it monsieur everything is turned topsyturvy in the world nowadays while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended	155.3395

thats all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos	97.7896
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	252.0900
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more	208.7305

what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh _parbleu_they should kill me the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the _let him die_ of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma christi_ which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words	341.2925
zounds want one cried the gascon	72.6097
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth	217.8137

at the lesser gate of the castle hes posted there are you a large party sixty let him know this moment sir and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return	241.7446
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan	459.3385
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	206.0304
although dartagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words	300.0223
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès you have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs i said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i cant keep on my legs	128.1156
de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on paradehe stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday eveningdo you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers after a moments silence no sir we do not but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow	109.8175

the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund	145.7155
planchet stopped short staring at dartagnan	183.4362
i thought so madame stammered the young girl	7.5639
this silence selfcontrol and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face	366.8103
goodnight friend and andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the pathway	211.6585
athos in his hours of gloomand these hours were frequentwas extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness	396.6594
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris	170.0259
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_ how dreadful said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted	87.7917

yes you said you had an idea said athos	56.3470
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rosetrees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season	246.4503
dartagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son	34.4090
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me	121.0982

yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coqhéron villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again	77.2622
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy	314.6394
no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for vengeance	385.1006
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong	53.2479
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said you are monsieur dartagnan i am that individual replied the officer	123.7654
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled	161.5491
no we have had great annoyances there	7971.2363

in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her	105.3664
he wore a vest of garnetcolored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridgebox worked with gold and red and green silk skyblue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt	579.4684

and now my dear child adieu for the present	102.2543
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever	138.3781
they traced her to châlons and there they lost her they lost her yes forever madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail	152.0156
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past	57.5823
or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it yes my good master cried bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was simply vengeancenothing else i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished what my house oh your excellency it was not yours then whose then	103.1636

we will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her	88.0167
there said he there is the work complete	543.8812
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	130.1495
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan	66.8318
de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit	541.8331
as dartagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer	80.1741
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report	164.6624
the door was instantly opened and shut someone was taken in the mousetrap	256.9539
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory dartagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor	230.2414
give the lackeys money and they will start we will give them money replied athos	94.2963
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady	70.2722
will that do yes what are you looking at i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that one would say you were carrying me off and they would be right _pardieu_ oh i think you swore eugénie and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	157.6891
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately	414.8739
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	166.0490
he will answer you the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor	390.4889
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man	95.5340
monsieur dartagnan repeated louis very well madame at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching	106.5349
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini	246.6861
dartagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen	49.5881
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him	130.0211
de tréville was at the moment in rather illhumor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving dartagnans response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his countrya double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to dartagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent	140.5471
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the sidegate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champsélysées	174.5331
no one has seen dartagnan and porthos has not appeared	129.4905
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abbé	153.8637
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creaturefrom the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guardsfrom that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firinglet off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms	297.5788
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m	186.9537
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette	16.9440
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him then continued châteaurenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champsélysées you only want a mistress albert smiled	209.7185
the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _lucia di lammermoor_ supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy	320.9263
lucullus dines with lucullus porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner but wine was wanting the bottle was empty	135.8888
it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when dartagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation	216.4835
what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects that is to say i visit an englishwomanthe one i named oh ay the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to adopt i gave you my reasons yes you look there for your outfit i think you said not at all	182.3143
everything goes as if in flowery paths everything goes too well porthos	1702.9841
but instead of growing easier dantès pains appeared to increase in violence	438.1206
the young man burst into a laugh	59.0197
have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles	3578.8455
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other hand	204.2922
maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the count	60.9630
why to converse with him of course	120.9383
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa	139.1378
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	63.8683
well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethunewas he not of bethuneyes egad of bethunenot been there i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it	246.6055
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	141.1795
these bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee la ramee came into the room	141.3061
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre	93.1659
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained	312.3487
well said the count you do not get out m	54.1827
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow	138.0281
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly	318.1719

oh muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond m	106.5519
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage	81.7894
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved	607.7858
mousqueton will lose another thats five and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes	178.1673
after a moments interval cocles appeared	146.4259
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps i should not hesitate	270.4766
the _mêlée_ became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers	38.9637
their connection could not last long without ruining both	1592.8027
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter	144.3124
he has been hanged and quartered i hope my god my god cried dartagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure	124.7016
it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that only be back again in three months for the _pharaon_ added the owner patting the young sailor on the back cannot sail without her captain without her captain cried dantès his eyes sparkling with animation pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart	197.3895
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken	163.1022
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves	834.0088
the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the princes messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame	169.2255
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss	308.6145

the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of alberts demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days	171.6283
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brotherthat is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	254.3208
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer	70.2234
marie michon and what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	128.4431
in his youth dartagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hotheaded propensities besides he had the cardinals hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word	203.8686
if you drag us both before a tribunal i will still say no my daughter is not guiltythere is no crime in my house	191.5415
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king	242.9828
oh mon dieu no nothing at all	95.8481

with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education	710.8193

listenyou know if i may be relied on yes said caderousse	87.3575
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion	255.0962
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionshe had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny	272.5006
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	166.3519
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around	137.8913

he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace	62.5068
athos led his guest into a diningroom of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hothouse full of magnificent flowers	150.7661
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed air	160.3598
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects	2049.5906
you to be sure said dartagnan pressing athoss hand	186.3702
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon	218.2406
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age	926.6765
he gallantly offered the righthand seat to beppo and sat by him	335.3242
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk	60.2520
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	98.5960

there said dartagnan we cant be overtaken	288.0455
see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught	213.8913
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced	164.7792
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police	58.2574

châteaurenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	130.8014
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed	157.7835
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her	198.3735
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude	547.1042
as to myself i shall go around to see athos for though i dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said dartagnan	286.4063
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment	293.6844
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared	169.7330
she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut	156.2908
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat	205.7300
dartagnan the elder an honor to which remember your ancient nobility gives you the rightsustain worthily your name of gentleman which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you	223.1226
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be hungrythats pretty good when i havent eaten for twentyfour hours muttered danglars	153.0443
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off	104.9488
so once more goodnight caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold	67.4768
come then my friend we will go forward havent you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary and how long ago was that when i last drew my poniard ah good another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt	125.4907
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor	76.2450
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved dartagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man	114.8169
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monks dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages	170.7154
where shall we pass the night he inquired	190.8687
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards theres no use in thinking any more about athos	159.2091

it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides	224.5807
the counts eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel	187.1542
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said dartagnan that matters little	92.2738
well i can weather the stormi whom notwithstanding you tax with fearnot with bravado that is not my way but i am firm	404.0923

when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well	183.3828

a daughter of henry iv of that great that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his soninlaw sir nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french speak italian sir	285.0529
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said dartagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you dartagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis	112.2598

you had only read a line or two said dartagnan read the letter again from the commencement willingly said aramis	249.2835

i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten oclock to breakfast	93.4327
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	546.5837
call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers	99.6267
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused	259.7456
nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clearsighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing	253.0139
dartagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale	556.7041
the steward gave him a gun this was what vampa longed for	598.0714
now then go go in the name of heaven i was expected at sharp midnight and i am late by five minutes yes but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages when one loves well and who told you i had no affair with a lover it is a man then who expects you cried dartagnan	131.9193

a sort of smile played on his lips	27.0306
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	327.4043

well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made you insist yes i insist permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising	79.4768
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity	105.7242
de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	86.7801

this instant sirthis instant i beseech you said the old lady	42.0414

it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad	83.6778
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars	254.3484
his two companions were already on horseback	85.8169
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man	243.6790
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel	66.9257
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	40.7825
then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let	165.7361
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink	163.3791
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos	45.5286
are you then pressed for this money yes for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow tomorrow	260.9196

was i not nearly your husband m and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd	139.6584

really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion debray smiled	287.8110
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne	89.4549
this same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt	510.6821
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a _calotte_ was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio	332.3291

the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague	205.6957
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blundersi mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more is there indeed my good fellow	260.5748
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	562.5878

at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard	948.8193
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully pale i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out	130.3298
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages eh eh said bonacieux slapping a plump round bag which returned of sound a money what do you think of this madame preacher whence comes that money you do not guess from the cardinal from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort the comte de rochefort why it was he who carried me off that may be madame and you receive silver from that man have you not said that that abduction was entirely political yes but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say i say you are a miserable creature continued mme	184.5605
the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts	152.9282
the brand disappeared the beauty alone remained	1060.4476
just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road	1123.3931
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us	342.8604

ah comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands i your son as you call mei will not let you twas the first time dartagnan had ever refused a request from athos	146.6010
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself	77.7135
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	167.1463
dartagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends	302.6730
dartagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his own	401.8493

we are compelled to admit to our readers that dartagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be	71.5898
upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop	182.9178
if dartagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is	84.2155
the duke exchanged a signal with them	106.9690

he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	188.5781
she must have a long arm hush said porthos placing a finger on his lips	73.8854

morrel had agreed to meet him	4.3924
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him davrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	120.5663

and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	101.5607
but no i should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	72.6308

his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller	138.0622
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade	121.0111
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage you speak charmingly said porthos	310.7460
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity	359.7450
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty the queen of england and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before	108.5231
you are good and faithful servants athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door	58.9238
m i do not know he is no longer in my hands replied villefort	56.1838
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more	81.7613
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road	119.9906
at last they reached the tennis court	926.1830
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk	274.6291
_holà_ aramis what the devil are you doing there cried the two friends	41.8360

the road was long but the horses upon which dartagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for dartagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant	178.6979
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine had the old mans face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there	205.0480

bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained	165.4754
as a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy let this victim to baal be sent to the lions the martyr be thrown thy god shall teach thee to repent from th abyss hell give ear to my moan felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified	369.7709

thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the momenta conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation	256.7039
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin just like the women replied dartagnan coolly	229.0377
dantès was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones	238.0010

this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel	205.5270
danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell	45.1755

ah said the king i was unjust here is a creature that loves me	113.2758

valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and villefort was biting his lips with vexation while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance	108.9772
thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my son m carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss father	138.3212
then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to m	78.3444
i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever	93.9626
he brought me up as if i had been his son and in he married	69.9374
on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends they reentered the drawingroom which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted	98.3810
it is the talk of all paris and you count have made this match asked beauchamp	146.0500
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed	154.5430
two hours after all was over we had done the business of both admiring the foresight of our poor father who had taken the precaution to bring each of us up in a different religion well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent fellow	137.0663
two royal pages were playing with him	21.4753
the count of sanfelice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited	289.3130
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired	263.5117
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	130.5391
you have no longer a weapon and besides i am on my guard	89.1371
well come set to ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried planchet	59.7355

when he came up again the light had disappeared	106.4183
yes my lord answered the man	53.5138
disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart	201.3299
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor the old man signified that he recollected him	110.9265
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star	344.3175
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast four	185.1275
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request noirtier made a sign that they did	74.3924
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued dartagnan with his frank expression	99.4156
my offers did not arouse himdid not even tempt him so much the worse he was a clever man	176.1897
athos was introduced and announced by name	505.8712
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed at what	78.6197
privately yes well i will remain with you at this moment villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came madame de villefort	104.6458
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned	117.0528
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you	84.8573
the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of firstrate breeding and knowledge of the world then you accept his offer said the host	125.4993
porthos aramis and dartagnan followed his example	166.4358
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	42.6677
devil take me if ive ever been so happy as at this moment and he wiped his eyes still moist	87.3712
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m	206.3206
you see that everything is to our advantage yes said dartagnan but we shall indubitably attract a ball well my dear replied athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets you are stupid friend porthos	183.2405
dessessart made him a sign to approach	58.8665
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux	98.4328
on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly	377.0676
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword	95.7686
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals	267.1526
la carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so come in dear m	116.4628
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais	161.2557
adieu i entreat you doctor all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal	441.0541
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose	138.5251
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart	335.9903
so that i have no society i live alone i am sick of itmy mind preys on itself dartagnan smiled	505.0669
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service had treated with the seraskier kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that ali tepeliniafter having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidenceresolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called _kataphygion_ or the refuge and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert	147.6033
believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosoma heart devoted to youbelieve that you have been the idol of our lives that we have as you well knowgood heavenrisked our lives twenty times for your majesty	284.7541
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held but on rising from his bed of justice on the twentyeighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever	128.5003
he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic	156.1185
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately the two friends went toward the shed	119.5013
tomorrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton how can you doubt it sir	65.6798
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m	105.3564
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	591.4609
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master	301.7430
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	189.4233
he must be the shah of persia travelling _incog_ have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m	271.4980
athos did not leave his chamber he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself	112.0314
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error well then if it be so are you ready albert perfectly let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy yes let us do so the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said _i signori francesi_ the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	143.5502
you are still with us i presume more than ever	156.1386
noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerm	572.8233
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master	125.3439
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices	182.8291
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion	74.4666
it is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbé busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolenthat was all oh your excellency returned bertuccio in deep contempt	154.2534
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent	275.7059
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one other woman who can do it as well	191.4054
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed	146.8818
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	101.1248
is this all no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal and the house of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly francs in all francs it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration	149.3409
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress but then you would be close to the sea that is what i hoped and supposing you had succeeded i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near herethe isle de daume or the isle de tiboulenand then i should have been safe could you have swum so far heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost all yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me tell me at least who you are i ami am no you mistrust me then said dantès	171.3796
gentlemen said de winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at parislet us separate to avoid suspicion	194.3113
this will teach you said dartagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion god	286.5578
m and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for morrel	178.5052
then a voice reached them once more sending this threat to our next meeting sirs in england chapter xliv	681.8517
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage	139.5283
now you talk my dear you pardon me we shall see said porthos majestically and the two separated saying till this evening the devil thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenards strongbox at last chapter xxxv	203.9139
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	96.0506
but that is not allafter rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with meguess what a strasbourg pie asked beauchamp	294.5203
the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations	119.4599
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mothers jewel case you think then i have something to dread asked dartagnan	305.7572
your hand madame your hand and i depart anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her	92.3909
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes	194.1937
the brigadier had a moments hope	1929.7725
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m	165.0889
do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them	153.9023
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	115.2181
no i searched the whole thicket	6069.0337
oh my dear dartagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me conceal your wounds when you have any silence is the last joy of the unhappy	150.0071
_certes_ cried athos you are the bestmounted poet of france or navarre well my dear aramis you dont want three horses	209.4380
the lattera pretty girl of about twenty or twentytwo years active and lively the true _soubrette_ of a great ladyjumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which dartagnan had perceived lubin	148.4229
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself	264.9800
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death	159.1577
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her dont try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis	206.9828
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears	145.9412
with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room his shadow did the same	111.7906
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night that was the very evening when the abduction of mme	86.2540
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	43.9036
you are right sir said raoul	103.6658
my arm and my life belong to you like my love then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving she stopped	86.0004
just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow	168.7938
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave	193.2065
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	223.7845
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself	179.4960
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh	93.1463
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a wellstuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward	218.3710
say so at once we are sufficiently wellbred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning to end	152.8604
the comte de la fere inhabits the castle of bragelonne in the environs of that city chapter xiii	149.6743
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table	85.4575
nevertheless he pressed dartagnans hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered	80.8122
it must be the son of mère simon who has stolen them i saw him strolling about here this morning	442.9047
it was a name that too often resounded in her majestys ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth	186.9595
de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously	116.3984
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown	137.5418
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	77.5067
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m	112.2015
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m	144.9954
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	392.3427
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause	413.6934
ali bring me some water the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting	235.7466
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i dont know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason	187.2399
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track	457.8991
it is only shown to me to terrify me thats all you are mistaken	64.7277
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon	210.5834
then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic and i on that of the huguenot	145.5890
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	157.8297
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine but in what carriage do we start i have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty let us go to the king dartagnan bowed and followed the queen	97.1498
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven oclock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten m what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven oclock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo	89.6922
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message	68.7841
remember your promise in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and dartagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and antechamber	99.9861
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur when you please said dartagnan	49.6407
where is the countwhere is haydée look said jacopo	2953.4980
it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man	50.4875
de saintméran oh doctor i would swear to it what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the other cases villefort ceased to contend he only groaned	214.5505
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table	119.4001
noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation ah indeed said m	60.9654
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that tomorrow at ten oclock at night we shall carry him off he has said it and will do it tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not dartagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them now sire resumed aramis listen to me	118.3308
the sentinel wanted to repulse him but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer	84.2962
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peters by daylight	306.5162
ah said dartagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold	388.5378
bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired	102.4211
there is nobody within said bonacieux	791.7890
a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend	86.9719
now jump down athos athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall	33.0273
oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out in what way why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them	98.2176
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly	181.5927
god sends me this and i hail it joyfully how strong and courageous you are said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion	325.8806
the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe	192.1944
i bought my experience dearlyparticularly fair women	2440.1348
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your lookthe thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a womanwere grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered	127.4016
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	159.7506
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for you	101.7437
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	629.9555
dartagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him	72.9292
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	304.3803
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	296.2248
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon and what did monsieur dartagnan reply monsieur dartagnan promised me his assistance but i soon found out that he was betraying me you impose upon justice	160.8806
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror	137.7600
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme	205.6885
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos	158.5220
how do you know it is the doctor asked valentine astonished	98.5354
i wont hold my tongue replied caderousse i say i want to know why they should put dantès in prison i like dantès dantès your health and he swallowed another glass of wine	131.6346
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera	204.0186
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound and grimaud threw the dagger on the table	98.8578
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	133.3440
monsieur dartagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity	89.3080
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he	136.1074
the steward could not restrain himself	39.1121
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his francs and the other livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the bankers servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon	184.8139
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres it appears so said athos since here they are	89.5202
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner probably not well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet	91.8896
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues the two young men looked at morcerf as if to sayare you mad or are you laughing at us and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon ah cried albert it is very lucky that m	170.5558
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence i understand	68.3088
are you french sir said he to athos	51.0601
then i shall be free i shall have an independent fortune and and what demanded morrel	142.2172
you too then are unhappy she said	49.8710
i was promised he should die with me	59.2481
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him	112.9750

the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression	279.2774

i looked upon myself as another judith i gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when i saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair i struck him in the middle of his breast	111.3065

oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven	287.9936
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview say no more of that madame said felton	101.8563
athos and aramis left paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton	116.0735

you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so porthos looked at dartagnan with an expression of profound admiration	53.6120
see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray	339.4879
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i dont know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself	94.7239
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay	18900.2148
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	125.1213
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me	505.3114
you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain	188.5741
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness	67.9799
i can pass that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friends long and thin body you will pass easily and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier dartagnan	126.2309
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle	42.2795
thanks to what aramis had told him dartagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon	133.8761
de tréville thats all very well	52.3738
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows	140.4139
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory	61.6287
m an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel	1926.4434
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	151.3525
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villeforts departure	505.3919
he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps	366.1553
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves me come my friend come let me embrace you	138.1723
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied dartagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn	122.7592
they went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden	205.0846
into the servicethe kings service mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at dartagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost choked	158.6473
and i was ready to strangle you cried the duke	49.8438
adieu valentine adieu said morrel bowing	563.5984
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i	110.8740
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr oreilly	159.1017
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise	79.5311
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	1113.8569
of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a woman	96.3632
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort	128.8972
when i return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he doesnt speak a word of french i take him into my service	102.3494
but could i do with a million retorted the count	183.7508
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable yes replied eugénie	192.8714
young man said he to dartagnan a suggestion what you may get into trouble by what has taken place you believe so yes	223.3567
he was a stout man of about two or threeandtwenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach	631.4613
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinals police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things	147.7609
on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement	222.4418
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand	122.6516
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	130.0329
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again	119.7233
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face	2209.6062
i pardieu and you would arrest him why not you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in so would i said porthos	113.8948
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window	216.6032
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak i speak of the adventureeh you know well what i mean alas no my lord replied dartagnan surprised	105.4569
now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell	137.9966
in a few minutes laporte came into the room	27.6435
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards	130.4099
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so	168.3538
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said dartagnan if you persist in offering him a civility	155.6916
the nightlamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimneypiece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned	234.5370
what do you mean by that you idiot asked dartagnan	217.1219
reflect upon it dartagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that dartagnan carried into everything	894.3868
he could not see it but he _felt_ its presence	1500.3057
dartagnan was the first to recover from his surprise	275.5373
monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce	511.2508
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	122.8236
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards	55.5404
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year of the hegira	87.8755
this he said to planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair madame de longueville but the convent where is that the convent your honor is at the other end of the village i know it well well then planchet gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the jesuits windows in about five minutes planchet returned	127.8436
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like dartagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light dartagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville	166.7179
no no dear dartagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis aramis gallop fast planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left and planchet with aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by dartagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream	157.8152
silence dherblay cried athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these	278.0106
tell me may i shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms albert said beauchamp with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man let us first sit down and talk rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer albert said the journalist these are questions which it is difficult to answer i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as lieutenantgénéral the count of morcerf peer of france what must then be done m what i have done albert	156.2821
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him	150.5728
de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt m my dear m	135.1022
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily	126.1354
do you agree with aramis not at all said dartagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion what you would follow the escort exclaimed porthos in dismay	164.5213
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang	229.3024
he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as i am i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors	129.7147
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses	140.4466
believe me it is only the evilminded who deny friendship they cannot understand it	836.4582
mousqueton cried dartagnan let us be off let us set off mousqueton recognizing the voice of his masters friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night	198.1423
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses	244.8504
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there very well monsieur said planchet	68.7080
he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes	122.9289
as mademoiselle de scudery remarks scarron and raoul laughed	356.4633
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	108.5071
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	113.7641
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side	156.6762
de la trémouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his hôtel	45.8567
and you are happy he said to his friend	46.3710

from a distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of _la jeune amélie_ and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landingplace he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident	419.0322
it is waiting for us at greenwich opposite the isle of dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights	261.4435
in the first instance to marseilles madame to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	272.0418

then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends	90.7237
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue	115.5047
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want eh pardieu said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money	102.2933
dartagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed behind	152.7148
welcome to ye thanks my lord	4.6354
daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak	90.5020

tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in france that henry iv the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with m	119.4086
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor it is from no personal illfeeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down	113.3386
he recognized albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed	159.3350
this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus	99.7370
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king	83.9146
one by one the several groups broke up	1863.5840
there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day	82.0686
he was charged to tell the comte de la fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations	71.5515
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m	106.6328
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all	141.5401
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of dartagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost	281.4741
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	282.1693
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise	169.9827
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine	120.0756
i think so answered albert in a firm tone	47.0886
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marblelike features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	213.8304
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act	263.8972
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu allpowerful	119.7067
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep	197.4131
on my word i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen how did it arise	182.8766
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	74.6695
sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise	64.8684
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur darminges and beat a retreat	132.4316
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly	699.7166
ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our revenge	136.4043
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children do you think so indeed i do and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel and is she gone the other night she left with madame danglars no with a relation	138.9470
will you not even say you will see me again he asked	53.1237
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed	166.9459
in one second athos joined him	16.4861
are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars why do you ask me now because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking how said albert whose brow reddened you think m	131.8775
as for porthos on whom dartagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute	91.8636
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant	120.1209
i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow	81.2866
noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind you do not wish me to marry m	79.3921
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor	128.1816
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened what	100.9560
you have no money coming in on which you can rely none you have exhausted every resource all and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored blood washes out dishonor said morrel	212.9543
she goes into england said athos	15.9262
were it liquid gold monsieur blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine	348.0398
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat	261.1566
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive	108.2210
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky	191.8633
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady	192.8077
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien with piercing eyes a large brow and a thin face which was made still longer by a _royal_ or _imperial_ as it is now called surmounted by a pair of mustaches	230.0227
if my mother could know of this attention on your partand i will venture to tell heri am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed	151.5840
my son said the old gascon gentleman in that pure béarn _patois_ of which henry iv	730.2891
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected	451.1807
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the _thousand and one nights_	342.0378
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous no i am pleasedso pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed andrea you speak to me before my servant how can i help that my boy	156.4357
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris when do you propose going thither have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties	135.9688
ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	159.6679
by the way said athos take some pains with your toilet raoul i want you to be approved i hope sir replied the youth smiling that theres no idea of a marriage for me you know of my engagement to louise athos in his turn smiled also	133.5060
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines are you a surgeon asked de guiche	126.3684
you are only betrayed the king sighed deeply	503.6367
dartagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly	101.1484
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	553.6148
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athoss lodging and there finish their plans	170.3112
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a whole pile which concerns you	105.8062
in all probability he has replied the valet for i saw the horses harnessed to his eminences carriage this morning and when i asked where he was going they told me to st germain he is beforehand with us said m	97.3283
morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality	332.8605
besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let planchet post himself behind us with his carbine planchet is a frondeur answered dartagnan	283.8747
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine grimaud hastened to awake dartagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place	142.2731
athos cried dartagnan wringing his hands	12.0421
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers	82.2645
a draught of wine dartagnan oh ill answer for you said the gascon filling porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion upon what asked porthos	144.4043
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it	358.4145
explain yourself more clearly i beg sir oh make yourself easyi am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean	300.2893
maximilian goes with _me_ said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brothers account once more farewell my dear sister emmanuel adieu morrel repeated	237.4751
why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother	69.8199
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued	87.8128
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex	338.6546
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered dartagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen	77.3280
he is not curious thought dartagnan	99.8093
very pretty but to the great astonishment of dartagnan the shutter remained closed	179.4038
i will not abandon buckingham thus	690.1837
she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches	560.8599
the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	190.0594
the wounds that i make are better than thatwitness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles	306.6497
ah locked he exclaimed these devils of english how suspicious they are locked said blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset locked repeated mousqueton	441.4046
its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health my health is well enough said fernand clenching his hands without raising his head	111.0962
but these francs here they are and more besides	179.7910
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him	107.8601
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday	613.2965
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	117.3204
be one or the other but not both replied porthos	182.8827
no but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for instance my dear little love in my country the ladies do without chambermaids	200.5616
or richelieufor two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleurdelis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence	448.8632
i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone	92.2381
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	143.2189
is the king wounded cried lord winter	179.0176
he knew the abbé de gondy only by report	1256.5403
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	59.4463
the demands in that programme must be granted we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling	196.9119
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person yes but in our situation we must not say all we knowparticularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues well can i see porthos certainly monsieur	135.9232
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	308.9816
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemans side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	125.7932
but to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever you are right said morrel calmly	251.6778
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow	192.8099
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you	80.6270
come come sleepy head quick the ladder but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window the other one the gardeners	366.5506
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously	541.4961
are you sure of it certain replied grimaud	1696.2980
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at halfpast two oclock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall	188.2598
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly	331.3163
haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel	95.8094
in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection	690.0300
sinbad the sailor the young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared	87.7375
did you say he was coming yes summoned by m	662.5280
in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was marie michon said madame de chevreuse hastily	197.0783
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security	190.3319
well that was a temptation for two wretches like you	195.7318
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it	74.1433
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	182.0333
very and all these one hundred and ninetyone were royalists asked athos	492.7880
gentlemen cried chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to fight go then into charenton for i shall begin in a short timetheres a signal from the prince the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince	143.8876
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful	1403.4581
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	271.7656
danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese	228.8388
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her	93.7919
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	308.0952
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus	98.6919
and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo	12.8649
though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh bicarat wished to hold out but jussac who had risen upon his elbow cried out to him to yield	155.3406
well whats the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man i ask you if you recognize him that manwait a bit ah i see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of bethune the former executioner of bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired	116.2186
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are i rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saintméran insist that m	178.5118
death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow	236.9167
they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards	85.0186
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one cant entertain	431.4629
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	121.0304
he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited you know not the subject of their conversation he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london was this woman english he called her milady it is he it must be he murmured tréville	131.8582
no my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france what do you think of all this said athos in a low tone to dartagnan after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english	125.0181
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine	176.4993
i went too but as i was older than fernand and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast	108.5543
i understand now why they murdered him valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold	198.6715
now is that all i believe so let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth dartagnan and athos to the bastille aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse porthos an ass madame bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion armentières on the banks of the lys	131.0189
and have you any recollection of your country when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again	68.1080
you dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said porthos	78.3767
now then she said what next madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony	92.4475
what is the matter said the count	8.7940
whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis	667.4422
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orangetree one after another	481.0740
and now said athos what is to be done	28.3448
dartagnan here himself but thats impossible he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal	37.8526
a horse for planchet thats all	73.5711
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champsélysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel	206.8595
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	432.1181
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town	25.5324
the count followed her with his eyes	28.1321
i was dancing the galop at torlonias with the countess g then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped	168.9881
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening	140.8326
the count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves tis true where can we find another sword asked porthos	195.1893
unhappily those times are past nonsense they will return said dartagnan	125.1727
my dear sir said châteaurenaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eyeglass half so well as debray	68.3140
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together	171.6710
my faith it appears so said dartagnan	16.6542
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time dartagnan was better informed than she was	152.5881
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him	154.6853
how exquisitely coselli sings his part but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is well then what do you say to la specchia	188.9942
go to your father go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me shall i row you ashore no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars	158.5822
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio	172.0778
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	337.4670
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him	109.3658
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead the devil cried dartagnan	193.6801
now then cried carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me no returned the chief she is thine carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight	104.0704
the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no in the rue meslay	105.9480
why the thing has made a tremendous noise yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse m then you do not speculate ihow could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income	148.2989
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme	90.8107
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold	376.2099
undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	125.2906
he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound	92.9818
these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he took no notice of them	100.2701
oh yes scoundrel he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed	346.3563
cap de diou if he troubles me too much i will crush him the insect do not fly then	162.8524
_au revoir_ then that is all i have to say today	56.9725
the siege of la rochelle the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of louis xiii and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal	51.7357
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	70.8240
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance but his father a sun _pluribus impar_ left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers	327.1456
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand	11343.9854
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night	121.7891
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simplea cabbage for instance	1228.2383
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman	281.5017
let us rather kill them yes kill them cried dartagnan i see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening	167.2529
dartagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds	199.9557
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself	275.5132
have you a carriage no that is of no consequence i always have one ready day and night always ready yes	284.9110
question then my lord where did the army cross the lys between saintvenant and aire by whom is it commanded by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke of how many does it consist eighteen thousand men and thirtysix cannon and its aim is lens you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers	370.6974
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there m the chest no longer there murmured madame danglars choking with fear	438.3555
haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes	257.9655
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept dartagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love	497.8365
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open dartagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid	194.1629
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès venture	1152.4237
he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	690.7905
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them	78.4534
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled	130.7534
no said felton it is nothing but what then is the noise that of the patrol going their rounds where is their road just under us they will discover us no if it does not lighten but they will run against the bottom of the ladder fortunately it is too short by six feet here they are my god silence both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking	181.4444
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse	470.4568
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat	275.8239
what then well he is a man porthos looked at dartagnan in astonishment	62.3144

we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo	44.1319
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her dartagnan then related the poisoning of mme	299.3090
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	107.2712
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller	194.3017
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat what said athos no fish at a seaport they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos	161.2932
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready	267.0363
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	166.1676
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity	183.9140
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	160.8240
the queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to valdegrace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her	179.9437
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist	343.2002
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cristo	116.1157
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife	84.2778
how pale you are no but i have just met with a terrible adventure are you alone athos _parbleu_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and dartagnan rushed into athoss chamber	106.6045
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted	151.8499
they passed into the next drawingroom where tea was prepared	5364.3174
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman the punishment of death replied lord de winter	59.1152
this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is but how could you have these fish brought to france oh nothing more easy	164.9227
what can it mean said debray to franz	120.4939
oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant i shall be dressed athos then called olivain	157.7522
bonacieux dead and dartagnan in a swoon	839.8000
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	160.1670
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble	122.6337
sdeath cried he to the coachman	582.8042
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated	2410.0933
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience	475.0263
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you you know what i have done i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	100.6475
fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends	82.3987
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity do not run down m	138.5644
everything was as athos had foreseen	456.3026
milady rushed to the door and opened it	24.8327
we have walked eight paces whispered dartagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery	281.1046
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer	584.5671
all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug	237.7997
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house	331.3469
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan	95.9189
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine	159.1626
i will prevent you m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings who am i repeated monte cristo	255.2751
de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet	1949.0466
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots	137.5621
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money	304.8126
i respect old age but i dont much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt	181.8713
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket grimaud immediately obeyed	730.1743
have you lost it asked blaisois	747.7026
de villeforts antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name	79.1145
but i repeat to you i am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen	90.2069
therefore athos had invented the phrase _family affair_	47549.2695
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me i	170.9642
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor	85.4159
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use	206.0322
the englishman is overflowing with pistoles	2114.2271
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercédès is not accountable to any person is she	143.3119
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of dartagnans voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself	133.0263
i have always found them and morei repeat it with joy with triumphi have always found some proof of human perversity or error	683.4966
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	93.3343
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspiresis not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon	256.7614
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited	173.1472
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	182.9258
you have hastened to mecan i have the happiness of being useful to you m yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me tell me what it is replied monte cristo	76.6814
we have had a narrow escape but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son	387.6419
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon	131.4724
dartagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it	118.3803
i dont know such a place and that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried athos	110.0930
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us	451.3148
it is not natural for letters to enter peoples houses in this manner	377.7958
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning	149.5117
and you will tell him i will publish the report of boisrobert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade	144.9851
oh it is impossibleutterly impossible what i have said i have said answered caderousse	62.6462
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate	94.4946
when all had gone out and the door was closed m	61.0089
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chiefs consent did the same	251.1545
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteurs carriage said dartagnan upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachmans little finger	264.6718
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself	97.1922
those who have read the _memoirs_ of mme	812.3325
he had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome everywhere	1002.9963
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment dartagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	290.0965
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman	119.6993
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	528.2481
i _beseech_ you the superior and mme	180.2838
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule	160.3916
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him he knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it by whom by me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information and what did you reply that i had none as yet but that i was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some you told him that said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face	100.9854
it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercédès dwelt	204.3475
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and dartagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written	102.7641
paris ii detest i loathe it very fine anne	207.2201
their vows were sacred and irrevocable	84270.7578
upon reaching the room below i found five or six customhouse officers and two or three gendarmesall heavily armed	372.4361
madame de saintméran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	202.3049
dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work	160.6281
and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie	370.1587
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable	276.1378
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	236.8279
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene	75.0350
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room	43.8676
he is badly off very badly we are in france and i am spanish so much the worse i had much rather you were french and myself also they would hate us both less nevertheless you consent yes if the thing be possible it is it is i who tell you so make preparations for departure i i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before in short if i go will you go too i will try you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many things what are they mazarins face smiling as it was became clouded	146.3589
she saw davrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night	98.0066
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper	113.6517
notwithstanding all the pains he took dartagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three newmade friends	300.5500
but methinks i need wine and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass	115.6587
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	143.7255
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the teatable he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow	115.9156
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo in italy sinbad the sailor in malta i forget what	63.8655
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of dartagnan and mme	120.4998
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of morianis a wellexecuted recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation	765.7307
far from wishing my lord to quit paris i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman	134.6627
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	104.2076
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckinghams assassination	127.7913
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched	172.2395
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and sensations	804.4481
i am of dartagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat	84.5209
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries	406.3220
am i to accompany you your excellency cried bertuccio	101.4106
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul	203.5042
he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone	70.0163
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody elses	249.3352
from that moment he grew very guarded	961.8659
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest m you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet feltyou are mistaken valentine dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger	240.5446
the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert	493.1177
the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world	233.6043
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	423.0477
under that pretense you run against me you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient	75.8264
that is your road excellency and now you cannot again mistake and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money	191.6057
well now shall i tell you something added athos coolly	126.2817
a gentleman laughed in my face	351.9280
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	1545.6742
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain it is my intention so to do come let us hear you	159.7538
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peaceoffering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame	319.0356
everything is paid replied the host and liberally	892.6722
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle	36.9113
ifaith aramis believe me there is little left to regret	227.5534
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent	63.2118
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation	94.9085
but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading	121.5299
i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune what do you mean i mean that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune	84.5748
m still dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect selfpossession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria dantès coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation	236.2539
was there not some snare laid for her	439.1968
andrea made no resistance although he protested against it	1636.7164
what do you think dartagnan said athos	24.7700
a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	154.0657
the catacombs of saint sebastian chapter	373.1007
you need not look for it i do not want it said the old man	20.0009
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe	346.8762
little flirtations perhaps and thats all	37.1888
at the end of an instants observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw miladys carriage stop opposite to him	167.1463
what do you require then i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke she is found said milady	135.1768
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles	845.5432
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	129.6514
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way the young man directed him but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route he begged luigi to be his guide	181.0942
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds gone	143.5901
i have two horsesi do not count my servants bobtailed nag	1109.6753
look at monsieur du vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage	215.6951
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	54.8175
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed	149.3907
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me _parbleu_ what do you desire it to be what do you want would you like to know certainly well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one you jest i presume i never jest let me pass you shall not pass my brave young man i will blow out your brains	84.5667
the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château dif giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper	107.6199
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will no sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses	139.4751
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockworkan ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of _the little versailles_	200.9998
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly	247.7898
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian it was precisely similar to his sisters apartments except that for the breakfastparlor he had a billiardroom where he received his friends	279.4356
was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	124.9115
and the name of this lord lord de winter lord de winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband	49.3882
the house may be suspected but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur dartagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal was it not this dartagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmesdéchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation	123.4853
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before haydée	193.1532
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other	71.2418
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow	132.0160
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge	1027.6407
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	383.7061
he was not deceived it was she whom he sought	89.4300
her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her brow	237.3684
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance	569.3429
pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master	159.8178
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	388.2707
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain at the moment when the hand of the massive timepiece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door	161.5031
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a wellknown form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped	199.1662
you meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics	22312.1152
well replied dartagnan bending his mouth to athoss ear and lowering his voice milady is marked with a _fleurdelis_ upon her shoulder ah cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his heart	80.4224
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box which box do you mean asked the countess	148.2262
and if i give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it by my honor by the faith of a gentleman said dartagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it	88.5932
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twentyfive years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hairfalling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose	433.1510
see what she writes to me athos said he	27.6435
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union	737.0410
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landingplace on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter	76.2341
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	103.9463
noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house	192.7194
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime	213.8701

the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst dartagnan was looking at bazin he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of dartagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous jean francois gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving	239.1470
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship	282.9190
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key	95.8602
the king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter take him alive no it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier	167.0680

this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow	85.2187
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured dartagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence	115.2512
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners bah said athos	283.3096
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides commingess troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to dartagnan and porthos well search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy and i feel no doubt that thanks to dartagnans ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master that poor planchet you speak of him very much at your ease aramis he has probably been killed	194.0776
no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately	178.2453
eh eh said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurators wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st magloirea littlefrequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end	221.6813
whom the man we are seeking it seems said dartagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries come replied the same lofty tone answer are you waiting for him underneath these windows	200.7128
escape had never once occurred to him	5.2179
and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse	147.6376
my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from heaven well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you i must again excuse myself m	137.5245
there are twentyfive bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my fall	180.8363
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration	159.0011
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink	207.5194
dartagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction stay you where you are and dont you stir or i will pull this ear off	261.4969
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower	56.5706
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet	77.8809
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	153.3636
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth francs to madame danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villeforts life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club	182.0733
was that it if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said dartagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery at all events answered dartagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	156.8752
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the executioner	183.9726
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping	159.4524
alas no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristos question and alberts answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it monte cristo reflected one instant	373.2932
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name speak or no absolution the dying man collected all his forces	175.8714
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger	81.2317
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majestys health	233.3265
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness	69.9417
the worthy mercer had immediately upon reentering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit	226.3787
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand	77.9081
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly well asked dartagnan	223.4310
franz dépinay said he you requested to see him	289.5665
the fifth of october it was about six oclock in the evening an opalcolored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean	302.4278
the procureur no the doctor yes you wish to remain alone with m	82.3496
pray was not monsieur dartagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude toguitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak outi know nothing but what the public knows	230.6145

you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist	97.0135
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	218.7313
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying great god exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand	156.7862
you will take a biscuit with it will you not yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging monte cristo rang baptistin appeared	123.5461
yes replied she trying to recover her selfpossession	824.5109
a moment later the grayheaded man was beside him	90.9237
instead of that louisedo you understandair liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples	3045.3115
i should like to offer him a last salute	317.3569
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	335.8968
a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to no rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise	172.4364
de villeforts communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m	168.7012
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed	551.4725
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	135.0323
dearest exclaimed valentine with her adorable smile awake and look at me morrel uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees	291.1450
constance replied the young man where are you	42.8346
dartagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey	198.3418
well sir the rupture of a bloodvessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second	113.9429
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door	104.7480
is it against you or against myself	320.3286
he resolved not to reach noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for noisy is only three or four leagues from paris on the road to meaux	138.3317
along the isle of dogs and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another	118.2495
de tréville listened to the young mans account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair	149.8820
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant	135.3944
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomasdulouvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious	209.0483
well do you not adopt this means athos said dartagnan	79.7187
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together till tomorrow then said aramis for ironnerved as you are you must need repose the next morning when dartagnan entered aramiss chamber he found him at the window	160.9835
whom does your highness wish me to send to you any one except grimaud the officer of the guard then with his chessboard yes five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess	111.1983
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	56.9593
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear	134.5297
in a blue frockcoat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor it is he said villefort turning pale	175.8337
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind	780.7064
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m	103.4365
the snow deadened the noise of his fall	44.6571
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	384.8829
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair	75.6935
now gentlemen said dartagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs	79.7651
at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercédès at the second he reminded her that he loved her	74.5308
the queen was still standing when he entered but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers how monsieur an investigation of my papersmine truly this is an indignity be kind enough to pardon me madame but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs	160.4763
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed	105.6027
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants	315.2256
see i have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves	305.7834
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	119.6055
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some selfreproach for his own want of heart and his avarice	265.9320
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i dont like to humiliate people then your duchess is still at the waters asked dartagnan	283.1152
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses	79.0960
good heavens we are on the very eve of it	65.4883
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body	231.7070
what did your father tell you m	30.6723
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine	1037.3579
on hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each others arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count entered	113.8862
excuse my putting such a question to you it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction	136.0754
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror	217.3644
but to return to what we were saying	104.1129
let us go and have a game at tennis la ramee my lordi beg your highnesss pardonbut i must beg for half an hours leave of absence why because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast well shall i send for some breakfast here no my lord i must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castledaddy marteau as they called him well well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris an invalid ordered country air for his health well what have i to do with that why good lord this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon	181.2363
our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence	109.7172
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth	189.7594
contact the foundation as set forth in section below	117.8709
well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint	153.8960
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font	362.4824
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening	132.7840
how can a young man live upon francs a month but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it the father will never repay it	143.3604
i believe so i dont know its of no consequence	236.3633
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head	318.0589
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto	136.9917
my letter of recommendation cried dartagnan my letter of recommendation or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten	152.9317
you see i am a good sort of a man do not jest about holy things my friend go on then i listen i had been at the seminary from nine years old in three days i should have been twenty	111.9165
parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle	87.7379
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on	247.2630
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own affairs	130.6974
in the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at eight	26.6168
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar	154.0377
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husbands strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan	138.9311
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child	94.5110
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed perhaps it was some one in that occupation said cromwell	183.4859
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him	52.9607
today he said with an efforttoday the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtiers room where he had seen him the preceding night	196.1106
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal	87.3685
you see mercédès said the young man here is easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again well repeat itrepeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mothers sanction	142.7609
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these words there appeared in noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine	116.5689
the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence	196.9645
i really must pray you to excuse me butin truthi was not attending to the conversation marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on ones wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m	341.1226
alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures	170.7677
some unknown enemyan invisible foehas done this the more must you fortify yourself albert	648.8952
i had no doubt he would return the following night	110.4953
and madame danglars will think me a very illmannered person	832.1922
descend my lord said the man in the moat	100.0951
speak out theres a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	140.9870
they entered for the door was not lockedthere is much confidence among villagers	3226.8257
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	218.9020
have you been satisfied with him this voyage that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir	137.3815
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us his voice went to my heart observed julie and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before chapter	93.8750
explain yourself then noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentines hand	254.1551
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	65.3921
but for heavens sake resumed aramis	53.7193
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named	115.5698
dépinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband indeed i fear m valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmothers last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter i assure you in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please i have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it then said villefort nothing further is required	177.6102
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest _aves cœli comederunt illam_ plague stifle you and your latin said dartagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted	172.4744
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating	326.9647
do you say resumed dartagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman i tell you i am sure of it continued the host	67.5540
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too	123.0874
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemys line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road	265.3879
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here i wish to knowcan you tell me prayis anything fresh occurring in this part of the town what do you mean	105.8186
george villiers duke of buckingham mme	4996.2373
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens	349.5895
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room	37.5596
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself	416.3787
noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door he saw valentine and his eye brightened	100.2237
debray who has not trembled before me	129.5888
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal	739.3635
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	86.6704
my god my god good god good god added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that	76.9364
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort	237.7289
danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenantgeneral which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée dantin	179.5762
when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeursthat is to say when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii	106.0778
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him and are there no cardinals that can fight	114.2129
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her	369.1487
they are two hotheadsthe one a gascon the other from picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately	548.1725
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian	152.3824
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this den set your mind at rest replied athos	152.4911
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her	445.2357
speak doctori am listening said villefort strikei am prepared for everything madame de saintméran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes	228.0259
and for whomfor some _grisette_ some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison	499.3925
the staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle	121.7249
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the nowuseless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell	177.2179
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back	203.6582
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed	241.7111
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain	472.2466
but will you not go up pass on before me i beg of you as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	87.2602
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance	178.5599
and the duke furious against the cardinal	22.1684
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything	1384.6444
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal	280.9809
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark	129.1766
draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands	215.9252
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know	995.0945
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	221.2018

the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection	221.2250

my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your eminence orders an escalade but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal	172.1926
fifty thousand francs muttered la carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune volume two m m m chapter	128.5531
first you purchase a house at auteuilthis house is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	127.7429

they must diedie all togetherkilled at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of gods	146.6591
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three	324.8932

the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbés ladder of cords	212.7957
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed	166.8098
the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin	393.7718
but this year continued the horticulturist ill take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe monte cristo had seen enough	179.9669
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching	190.8939
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know boistracy is an intimate friend of mine and i cannot allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form the fact is hazarded dartagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis	139.1492
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew	198.8965
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy	243.1269
all falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face	159.8223

i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retzs appearance	129.2605
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	161.3285
monsieur duke i must have those letters sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will	243.1376
dartagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme	117.5431
de villefortwhat do you mean i mean that m	54.5594

you asked for candor and you have it	42.4415
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride	141.6519
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor	941.2255
without your aid continued he repeating the counts words i should have been a dead manthrice dead my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	189.2848

a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	196.8628

more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother	182.3693
he was her grandfather on the mothers side	73.9628
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	97.0115
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation	315.1627
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness	127.9279
but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits i have a dreadful headache said albert	132.9018

she had laid that down the preceding evening	75.0754
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account	115.0960
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	36.9048

what is this rent said he showing dartagnan a place where it had been pierced through	134.8900
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile	194.6510
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed	141.9185
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest	187.4358
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned	551.8658

i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	147.9311

at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	413.2310

bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of châteaurenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	171.2574
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets	103.4351
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his horses	96.5745
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saintméran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after	40.2834

raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model	122.9458
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger	118.1669
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep	364.5753
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother	99.8502

he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the _thousand and one nights_	96.9236
what is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding back	290.2596

she cried out but davrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left	152.6361
she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evilthat immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world	339.1992

alas the queen my sister is no longer queen my child	82.5102
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos	149.1710
m mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast	239.1852
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted and is that allis that all replied buckingham impatiently	112.9311
from the ends of these two wings extended the park	295.4354
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	3995.8198
well read it he demands your head m my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two men	133.7261
of the interval passed nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees mountains and landscapes are lost	347.2365
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost francs upon the spanish loan and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss why not is it my fault you have lost francs certainly it is not mine once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to me	134.8882
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase	184.8366
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	519.4544
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness	211.6459
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you sufferyou maximilian whom i love as my own son	208.7779

the king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number	91.2561
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but dartagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down tonight upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur dartagnan to the end of the world	97.5679
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you m noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	139.0155
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the _pharaon_ yes and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl yes now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things	101.2104
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	402.7338
i will no longer detain you m	22.5799
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin	224.4140
do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house	25.7582
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to dartagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him	107.8572
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	93.5279
i have that honor your excellency you had a new livery yesterday yes sir i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow	110.6167
how pale he is said châteaurenaud shuddering	913.9281
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person	143.5273
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon	175.3358
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m	147.0398
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	209.2335
dartagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guards march upon the door	179.3198
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither	79.4484
soldiers are big children but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed dartagnan could not restrain a smile	66.0144
the chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it	58.1501
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest	102.3681
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded pooh said caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said cavalcanti	279.2950
let us shut this one up they put the stone back in its place the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in	162.1706
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels	198.9582
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview	152.5706

the kings musketeers and the cardinals guards chapter vi	470.3279
next morning dartagnan was the first to rise	91.5138
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire	167.9271
so now i breathe againi am happy dont be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed dartagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering	341.0574

danglars was there alsoyou recollect m	309.0193
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello	91.6902
it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	178.4774
the letter is here and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom	86.0877
then in addition to these concealed or public secret or open wars there were robbers mendicants huguenots wolves and scoundrels who made war upon everybody	1317.4327
this is recent news sir continued she and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter i should not have heard till tomorrow perhaps after tomorrowthe last of all paris madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian your guardian is he too a bragelonne asked lord de winter	115.6907

and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once i cannot believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	127.6573
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair	158.3226
at this moment comminges rushed into the room	8.3815
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls heart	139.0548
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet	311.4936
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem	164.2413

i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings throat a man in a mask cried athos	176.6266
they knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself	137.8788
i love your devotedness said milady	68.9132
ah thats the thing replied the gascon	18.8431
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier dherblay two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword	108.7342
it is a little worse for the journey but thats no matter there are no horses albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand	82.5908
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur asked monte cristo	62.6720
thank god i am not a bravo and being a musketeer but for a time i only fight when i am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by you by _us_ you mean cried dartagnan	132.1674
but with his simple musketeers uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank	128.8508
pardon meat least such i have heard is your custom nay madame	183.3257
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected	1265.9916

because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself	131.8019
alas said she i did all for the best one of our clients is a horsedealer he owes money to the office and is backward in his pay	218.0809

the countess took albert to meet madame danglars	128.1678
from whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him	270.2020
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again	679.5352
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him	51.8769
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew	155.4961
the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly still said the queen	79.3333
shall you keep it or send it back i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it	100.6551
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors	252.0075
planchet waited towel on arm fourreau uncorked the bottles and brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters	526.2815
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely reechoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	247.4427
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hopeoh do not follow my example	421.1649
you have only to wait here till i release you dartagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal	115.3172
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	1603.2581
her very self she gave it me last night	162.9000
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence ah really said monte cristo in a halfstifled voice	194.5386
he had now leisure to look to his wound	196.0551
if they recognize you you are lost care not for me sire think only of yourself	185.7703
now am i at liberty to retire said the general	45.6991
they had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell	173.7583
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that	113.6544

somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	1507.3351
ah come in come in monsieur dartagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too	89.8562
danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goatskin and did not breathe another word	148.4759
ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos	109.7346

he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	252.4616
passing alongside one of them dartagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meungthe same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom dartagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her	138.6340

yes and without violence said louise	2072.0879

i understand perfectly again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial	134.3467
everything that savors of mystery charms them	1335.7114
morrel left on old dantès chimneypiece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt	301.0079
it is to be tomorrow said aramis hastily	150.9822
dartagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	231.7281
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out	68.9881
dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	179.7473
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz	119.7608
planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at armentières	50.0144
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume	951.9240
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me	160.3999
besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	188.7566
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme	120.3473
what am i to do nothing very difficult but what is it to repeat these signs monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked	108.8000
dartagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	101.1891
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	68.9503
who is there answered the voice of her he sought	100.3449
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words october it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse	173.9603
have you a good horse monsieur de bragelonne my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my lackeys choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best	170.1019
in the corridor he met mme	638.7814
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers	144.2099
he was too late milady had stabbed herself	285.1755
the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbé faria had spread the riches of his mind	179.5526
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst yes added planchet like the famous ass of buridan	371.8648
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but morehe is one of our friends no madame replied raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle the young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor	151.6629
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse politeness you simpleton retorted la carconte	694.2104
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams	161.2384
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips	110.8027
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle	311.9273
i have told you my wish or rather my determination	312.2325
today i am engaged in a different affair	292.6587
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness yes said the old man	142.5292
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	90.4302
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice	42.9112
monsieur said emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to m	139.7102
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris	164.3901
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down	133.5476
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him	203.1340
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to farias dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen	348.7734
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh	151.3050
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	199.9926
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel	141.1287
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling	15.7973
as we have said he perfectly understood the old mans vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing	169.4702
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the armchair prepared for the royal prisoner	164.2576
ah cried blaisois he is lost grimauds a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton	892.6382
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind	119.8472
why just remember what they said	134.5512
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign where is the treaty here it is anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that dartagnan presented to her	96.8044
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des gardes	38.5362
debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it	49.4891
he would not however yield immediately to the young mans request but made a few conscientious objections	194.4901
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long night	103.5520
touches upon the strange effects a halfpistole may have	197.3638
there is the true reason idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it out but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment	64.3643
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcanoan extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome	284.7563
do you not recognize me unhappy child silencebe silent said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for heavens sake do not speak so loud you wish to speak with me alone do you not said bertuccio	148.7581
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	383.5425
oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad yes yes i replied he	151.5234
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk	702.8459
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it m go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	70.9615
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	83.8829
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad augury	303.2353
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone	15.4664
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort	98.3342
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	183.5226
milady had likewise the best of passportsher beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles	618.8342
arrest musketeers you were among themyou were dont deny it you were recognized and the cardinal named you	319.7750
my life belongs to my cash	6449.0952
the procurators wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation	116.5004
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors answer	101.7763
now then said dartagnan this is something like this is a means of communication	91.8972
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out	249.5723
what think you of it inquired athos	104.5945
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the th of february not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he cannot be a traitor oh no no cried dantès	107.8080
whats that asked porthos what are they firing at now	279.1220
you blackguard cried athos going toward him ill cut your ears off at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos	138.9355
de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin	1987.5251
he thought the carriage was about to stop there	61.1502
two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them	236.4327
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation	406.7451
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old yes but i could give him the orderi guitantand i preferred to give it to you guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier	186.9693
noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	8548.0557
what is it news to you	10.8522
edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins	218.8551
the circumstances that had hastened the return of dartagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guardchamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolflike step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink	201.5768
the fortune of war my dear viscountthe caprice of fortune that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for and is her name a secret as regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friends and on whose silence i feel i may rely if i consider it necessary to enjoin itmay i not do so certainly on my word of honor you know the history of the pasha of yanina do you not of ali tepelini oh yes it was in his service that my father made his fortune true i had forgotten that m well what is haydée to ali tepelini merely his daughter what	131.1578
besides which in a short time resumed dartagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety well then i decide i have your word then yes tis given	307.9935
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twentyfive and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	419.3452
poor fellow remarked danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	35.1558
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa	204.0469
but let us see whatever i may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure	242.6542
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection	127.1950
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow	235.0091
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting	228.7112
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	124.9736
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired	90.0800
judge if i should not put myself under its protection flattery was at that period very current and m	403.4359
be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses	110.8386
i thought i had quite said groslow	249.6225
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	205.7328
dartagnan was acquainted with villarscotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time villarscotterets was a royal residence	189.2014
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us	1098.2361
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles	94.4316
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	138.7891
noirtier watched her with evident anguish	11632.0645
i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal	133.4731
de tréville captain of the kings musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis	122.0205
the footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand dantès guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handbier	355.8548
_ma foi_ yes though he was in his own element what do you mean the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists great is truth muttered the count fire cannot burn nor water drown it thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimneycorner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge	195.1587
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling	180.8729
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor	131.5867
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger	78.8080
police affairs cried the king taking up trévilles words police affairs and what do you know about them monsieur	351.9742
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the travelers abandoning his purse to save his life	95.8112
what does he want with me	27.0845
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him	27.2844
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused	99.8991
monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine planchet from head to foot	198.2277
de boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest	192.6572
i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy	76.7733
as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at portoferrajo yes most satisfactory my dear danglars well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	136.2353
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing	538.9526
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something	131.1535
to the installation of my rival at m	341.3039
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier	122.8356
so call me mercédès if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m	141.9324
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti	85.3904
unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut upcaptured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered	201.9015
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m	140.3110
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime and youdo you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body how miserable not to be free dont be downcast	177.3582
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter	64.7250
he returned speedily advised the prisoner to be more careful and departed	130.5806
i pass my life upon my legs aramis again presented himself at the bishops	199.2495
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son	184.8171
what do you want screamed milady	132.0399
and you porthos faith i am going to fightbecause i am going to fight answered porthos reddening	178.6139
it is true between ourselves that m	68.0139
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him	206.1721
de la trémouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said tréville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you make it monsieur i listen how is monsieur bernajoux your esquires relative why monsieur very ill indeed in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad things but has the wounded man retained his senses perfectly does he talk with difficulty but he can speak well monsieur let us go to him	143.6191
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn	174.2063
that very day the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success	693.1212

he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death	148.0927
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are a fallen prince exclaimed mazarin piteously	183.6850
it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	102.1466
where are your passports we have none we left england ignorant of the state of politics here having left paris before the departure of the king ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are mazarinists who are sent as spies my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport	164.1040

i do not remember if it is exactly francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference	134.6919
dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	406.8505
listen madame and recall your remembrances	16219.6582
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	196.4080
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five oclock was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one muttered dartagnan	114.7064
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions	167.6599
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy	146.2212
no it does not concern me	5.9029
ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own	148.4794

poor queen already fallen though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean	269.1587
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw	95.0016
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down	304.9837
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted	171.9405
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of dartagnan	33.3559
athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful smile	13039.6494
can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers	166.5529

oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists sayour masters in everythingthose favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law	217.6986
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	688.9956

danglars what rival _ma foi_ what rival	3058.6479
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed halfhours interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes	321.3813
oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone	221.6847

having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twentyfive thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given	154.0362

well thought dartagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my faultfor it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him	150.8380
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets	100.2707
gentlemen said dartagnan you shall have your turn	81.3368
yes but never with the same advantages said dartagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight very good very good said the voice	88.2168

but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world	104.4230
so dartagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply	176.7449
we must then as it appears to me travel in company	170.7662

it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta	126.1875

anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds aramis porthos cried athos and laughed aloud	458.4987

alack alack cried the cardinal a venetian glass oh my lord said dartagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian but what do you advise then asked mazarin trembling	186.2321
well replied la ramee your supper is ordered ah and what is it to be	70.8222
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father hasat least i hope soabjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and ordera better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction having made this wellturned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court	277.7278
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneysgeneral and bailiffs	2490.1824
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a halfopen door from which he could see the whole of a small room	156.0341
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table	59.7952
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison ah monsieur de rochefort have i not told you already that i had nothing to do with that	80.1678
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his	54.3528
take this peach then she said	53.9979
mademoiselle danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	6687.8599
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight	95.1210
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance	278.2298
do not call anyonedo not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the counts marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girls mind	134.5546
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	3047.0808
youll excuse me i know they exchanged bows and dartagnan returned to his companions	132.5963
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith	66.1740
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods	321.0333
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine the counts heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young mans shoulder said i was looking for you my friend monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot	130.4971
these steps came on came fast	337376.3438
today is the twentieth of september	273.9283
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs	979.8278
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our timeit is precious	238.1119
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	206.6458
the skiff lightning dartagnan had judged correctly mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none	182.6129
in which the plot thickens his visit to m	103.5962
help help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue	206.3638
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs	356.7328
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison m oh pardon me sir let me live she is cowardly said villefort	213.1073
i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob go and lose not a moment	252.7919
and this explains how dartagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la chevrette	49.3940
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	453.6367
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it	327.5867
i told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs but she always laughed at me	273.7388
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword the two gentlemen then went into the church	77.7823
it seems you must always be playing some game or other yes and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take	89.2156
you wished it to be preceded by all these titles it is quite wonderful mr president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner	242.6803
it is long since we have had a good dinner and i for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry i confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy agreed as to the old burgundy i have no objection to that said aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of conversion	151.5990
did you ever suffer from a strain athos never though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos said aramis	111.4906
between six and seven oclock the road of chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy but suppose we all go said dartagnan what the devil they wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said porthos	194.2739
m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht	252.8226
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated	200.5111
_salite_ said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant	33.3906
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement	304.6867
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept	70.1654
woe to them if it be so and he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the seine	190.5568
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand	103.2169
she should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last	243.0297
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me no i thank you should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not i am not sure be twentyfour hours in prison without getting free my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly	159.9024
dartagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side	39.8812
have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and ii will appeal to his eminence at once mme	82.5020
i will summon him hither it is useless he would not come up to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner	79.0549
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects oh my lord my lord that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public but your honor will soon be called so generally i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	182.4303
will you go away from here demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry	289.4628
revenge yourself then edmond cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culpritson him on me but not on my son it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation	147.0403
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company cant do without me there my leave is at an end do you return to paris asked athos quickly	174.0961

they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	71.4897
patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london	116.5374

the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	179.8738
set out immediately for paris and demand of the count of monte cristo avenue des champsélysées no the son whom you had by the marchesa corsinari and who was taken from you at five years of age	112.2270
one of us would suffice really my dear monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence and bernouindo i not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish my lord there is time to draw back said dartagnan and your eminence is perfectly free not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of dartagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling	88.5274
meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed	43.9123
im no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own	93.4453
on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them	207.6178
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappearthat i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection	358.5295
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it not at all ah that gives me more confidence this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascons soul	178.7952
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	82.8640
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance	154.6503
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	133.2482
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood	493.9393

a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation to whom does this island belong to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile	156.7480
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the _semaphore_ this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office	90.4552
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brotherinlaw	175.7069

he listenedall was silent as it had been for the last three days	43.9359
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you	38.0384

he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited	104.3994
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abbé	139.1851
the jailer continued now this was his project	139.3552

bonacieux with a halfsmile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience	166.7417
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved	89.1681
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are shed you who weep dartagnan and the curate appeared pleased	2130.0918

and now once more adieu said morrel	42.2350
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence	49.7543
yours is a pretty business but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between youof an infernal plan i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i abjure her i curse her bah said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere	159.0410
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	251.1681
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only châteaurenaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	116.9455
carriages now arrived in crowds those of the marechal de villeroy guitant villequier and comminges came into the line	171.7191
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companions elbow directed his attention by his glances	505.2141
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass it is singular said the doctor i was not aware that madame de saintméran was subject to such hallucinations it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad and my father who you know is a strongminded man himself appeared deeply impressed we will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone	146.9798
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church	98.9902

at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	28.7961
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes he must have one said athos	203.5663
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket	89.0617
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him	120.0626
flying through an army sire said athos in all countries in the world is called charging then i shall die sword in hand said charles	119.8420

well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot that it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult	163.0991
poor madame du vallon her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes so you are free now and rich alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year	209.8038
for one second dartagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and dartagnan recognized the coadjutor	89.9737
have i travelled in that country	219.8988
come said dartagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match	251.9554

his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityin fact the application of the axiom _pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you_ an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of _knowing others_	426.5652

i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercédès nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	193.9969
however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken	126.6037
for me said dartagnan are you sure of that _pardieu_ monsieur i cant be more sure	81.9349
noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron dépinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	146.0101

i used to play almost every night in france and since your return to england i have not handled a card or dicebox i sincerely pity you said dartagnan with an air of profound compassion	164.2941

the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game	243.6510
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons but i love her my lord and was jealous	90.0149
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty but tell me dantès if you had command of the _pharaon_ should you be glad to see danglars remain captain or mate m	91.0026
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said	218.6729
but vampa raised his head proudly as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold	320.8524
ah my friend said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me	242.0913
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest	154.0216

from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years	198.1683
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	245.1959
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge	628.3616

in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at portovecchio and tunis	194.4448
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	224.6786
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly	259.8184
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say why yes replied dartagnan with embarrassment	142.2605
louvieres was proud and satisfied he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided in his fathers deliverance from prison	156.9636
villefort became pale he understood the old mans meaning	130.5956
well then madame yes i did feel fear and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i cannot count how many charges and skirmishes i own for the third time in my life i was afraid	175.0925
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time sit down said the old man	82.0348
dartagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and dartagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a huntinghound in his old masters company	96.9622
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf	45.6387
tell me have you ever thought that seven times francs make nearly twelve millions	264.1899
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property	263.6092

whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	358.6535
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope i cannot tell you that replied the inspector i can only promise to examine into your case oh i am freethen i am saved who arrested you m	116.2252
ah if mousqueton were here theres a fellow who will never desert me so long as you are rich ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us	199.6584
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber	83.9996
and why ah very well said dartagnan i see that you understand french	39.2088
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details	58.5861
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose	196.6271
she wore a blue and whitestriped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps	318.5619
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them	456.9738
have you lost your heart indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valère reply to alceste at the théâtre français	316.9197
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a sideglance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is prettyi think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing	154.7595
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	70.6354
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	89.8104
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality	96.8251
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	208.5232
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt	92.3073
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder	199.4364
you will charge broussel to report it	510.2170
it is for me to give orders here and not you monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you i want none it was a temporary indisposition	164.5109
she has taken care for herselfat least i hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me	564.3369
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers go cornélie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer cornélie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray	142.4922
no said dartagnan no i confess it	73.6419
in case i am killed the captains name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning	261.8901
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything	195.3426
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen mazarin listened intently	263.8793
all at once he uttered a terrible cry	41.8111
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin	102.0098
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	75.1605
debray perhaps as it was once proposed	2254.8389
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him	133.6817
you are ungrateful dartagnan said athos yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner	217.0472
de tréville was asking dartagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour	97.5215
i do not know you for one of us then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat	40.7008
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deepseated hatred of idealitythese were the elements of private and public life displayed by m	661.0605
a mattress was laid upon the deck for him	63.9316
how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixtysix years old	240.8119
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door	97.1840
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water	159.0036
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the diningroom your humble servant going first to show the way at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest	204.6130
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish ityou are inflexible	365.2085
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer	79.8596
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner how foolish you are have you forgotten that m	124.1814
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way	143.2307
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	89.6411
de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult	87.1518
the door was wide open a hackneycoach was standing in the middle of the yarda strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment	168.7139
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me	63.5743
why count exclaimed eugénie what has happened to your ward	133.3730
dantès examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form	149.5397
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence how could that be monsieur	146.1310
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form	765.2204
at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinals treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orangetree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came fromnot even the cardinal it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos	265.7972
why did you not say so at once my dear sir all england is with cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners i bend sir to your wishes	147.5260
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon	142.9837
the evening was no longer joy but delirium	2010.0571
well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea really exclaimed the englishman	64.6023
dartagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the night	191.9812
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices	215.5103
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance good said milady to herself who knows i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the vein she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	206.1989
well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside	114.3449
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the end of a year i became used to it and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays holidays yes when when we have a fog ah to be sure those are indeed holidays to me i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long how long have you been here ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen you are fiftyfive years old how long must you have served to claim the pension oh sir twentyfive years and how much is the pension a hundred crowns poor humanity murmured monte cristo	222.9233
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well	87.1481
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured	213.3039
dartagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question	193.0466
the time of the carnival was at hand	116.5358
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was over	174.7673
m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority	218.9796
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep	108.1029
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos	168.0432
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so dartagnan saw that he became pale	99.6262
you appear to be a brave young man besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen	82.5131
i recollect then i paid the host six what a brute of a host why did you give him six pistoles you told me to give them to him it is true i am too goodnatured	103.5651
morrel take my word for it and i advise you not to take francs for the profits of the voyage then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a manofwar	148.2981
did you ever see her furious no said athos	354.6774
i cannot stop a moment i must start for paris again immediately what	154.6389
well asked peppino of his friend	199.9918
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fécamp must she not m certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles and the yacht was ordered to remain at martigues tis well	255.1331
dartagnan relates that on his first visit to m	95.5956
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the cardinalremember what i tell you athoswe shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish	129.6203
albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert	257.3565
the sailors looked at one another	185.9212
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	67.9970
zaccone ah indeed and when a child i often played with the son in the timberyards but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count	115.2084
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him	111.8226
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable enough	152.1080
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her	78.4659
it is you mordaunt he said	15.9158
stay said monte cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the ironwork of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant m monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled	255.8678
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms	80.0381
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us go away from here said dartagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood rascal eh monsieur said dartagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat do you hear well well rejoined the leader theres no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for	130.1676
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny	236.4295
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man	55.8880
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniardi am a cosmopolite	303.5194
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his eminence aramis then joined athos and dartagnan who were consulting together	111.7441
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it	349.0837
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry	599.5988
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person	90.3761
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen	78.5788

then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel	75.0738
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his lips	261.4214

morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	206.0554
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner	71.4442
with monsieur monsieur has returned then of course naively replied the servant	326.3659
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said but no it is not for me to be the judith to deliver bethulia from this holofernes	161.3592

at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room	161.3954
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him	295.6752

danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another halfhour which appeared to him like a century	138.3126
dartagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his revenge	170.8312

in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together	144.5482
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guardi did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet	134.7047

de motteville will not be astonished at this reply	94.2951
i can scarcely credit it nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m	151.4258

the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	162.1942
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m	194.8910
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord said rochefort	39.0551

we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest	191.6037

besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	131.2167

dépinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile	173.4481
he went to desire you to come to the palace	44.3040

morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject	62.2350

here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing	809.9190

the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length dartagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick	98.8584

in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifes having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt	240.8834
upon this promise dartagnan withdrew and the next day he began service	122.3799

his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly	937.3691
and yet as you come from dax or pau from tarbes said dartagnan	880.2020
he decided then to tell all	159.2175
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurators wife with a sigh	106.0736
dont you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	119.2327

ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury for their ears closely applied to the door did not lose a syllable of what he said while their mouths repeated as he went on the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber	105.9019
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself	102.1864
what have you to say in your defense asked bradshaw of the king	254.3250
ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient	156.5919
the king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh athos did not reply he reflected	191.3161
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	49.0290
where am i exclaimed she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady	212.9082

dear constance i have at length then intelligence of you	191.6684
the soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages	134.4143
there is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe	182.5983
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	98.4830
at length the reading of the indictment was ended	162.3781
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras	144.5110
it was necessary to reach m	225.5648
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head	134.2210
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo	466.9925
come come madame cried dartagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	147.9293
the result was that to prevent mm	49436.4414
i insult you said lord de winter with contempt	42.8540
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed	237.8674
what the devil continued the king	38.0159
i was wrong then no i said what you saythere is a crisis at hand	278.5648
zounds he said i dont suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i dont know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee	153.3840
_dentro la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing accent	207.8312
the young girl hastily took the letter from him	32.7949
why to accuse the man do you address the woman do i know m	88.5136
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven	196.5964
if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me no signature	193.5859
bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandyfor instance between le havre and boulogne	722.6833
darminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion	201.3706
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency	435.6667
at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits and on his left the curate of montdidier	101.4259
he might fail but something must be left to chance	92.6913
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced	138.2105
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham	396.5575
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc dangoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	176.5991
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape	31.2005
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken well well dont be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous	127.6422
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital faubourg saintgermain said châteaurenaud	433.9138
i am the most wretched of men	63.6908
dartagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand	43.6273
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemys entire army	197.8237
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale	185.9582
danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl	72.5176
you have two or three times mentioned a m	236.8540
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality can he be seen without doing so	345.6806
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you	49.9091
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	121.0423
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent	212.6699
dartagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scrupleon the contrary thanking his majesty greatly	347.7042
yes my lord replied the young man confused	97.6715
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me	142.1073
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear dartagnan very good said dartagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous dartagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	161.9009
edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result	268.7265
make haste and dress yourself in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you yes that i have suffered but the culprit that is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate but peppinowhat has become of him peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion	159.4390
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ringtrue said my mother	87.8979
he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor	146.3723
i remained in the room and waited oh heaven m when daylight dawned i went down again	271.5161
oh sir reply i entreat youis not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis xiii who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age yes sir you are right in every particular and who served under an assumed name under the name of athos	165.7008
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured	2814.9705
oh no dear count cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to what do you mean aramis that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois and nothing else what our friends are become our most dangerous enemies athos	138.2968
cavalcanti something of the state of your finances _ma foi_ monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord do you hear what he says major certainly i do but do you understand i do your son says he requires money well what would you have me do said the major	122.9282
but devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions	144.2902
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so	142.0902
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence	241.5467
count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without valentine the earth is desolate i have told you to hope said the count	185.0724
if you like replied the latter	111.5621
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one	135.8749
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksmanthere we are about equal	187.7557
who are you i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château dif god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you ah i recognize youi recognize you exclaimed the kings attorney you are i am edmond dantès you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe	142.6932
twelve hours delay was all that was grantedthat is until nine the next morning	365.8619
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me	106.4519
treat her as one of your sisters	777.7506
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit	127.1094
of russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers	589.9950
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master or his mistress interrupted dartagnan	101.4849
his mother the councillors old servant opened it	113.8462
cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but alexander vi	250.0423
order was reestablished in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another	220.7498
dartagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away	187.0606
as to dartagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying	276.1949
what cried dartagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos yes that disturbs you by no means and here is the second dartagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis	141.4969
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared	142.3193
decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think	109.3594
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing	117.3243
what do you want asked blaisois	905.4785
duke you already know that it is not i who caused you to be written to yes yes madame yes your majesty cried the duke	58.1669
that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand	92.0103
do you keep a journal no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself do you talk in your sleep m i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baronesss face and villefort turned awfully pale	169.9651
the first movement of dartagnan was to return it but milady added no no keep that ring for love of me	155.9213
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a giltheaded screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons	130.0326
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room	113.1929
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her	486.7554
amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valérien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans	707.5283
m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	308.3641
on descending we saw through the latticework several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view	570.5923
they are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of oh cried athos	294.1126
ah my dear fellow excuse me i am lodged like a chartreux	121.8159
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the kings place we might be off during the time if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queens service not at all said dartagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost you are right sir always right said anne of austria	111.6551
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water	101.9575
danglars not at all let us recall the exact facts	223.9004
remember to go to the count on the th may at seven oclock in the evening	59.3871
dessessart who esteemed dartagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment	923.7343
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall	235.6113
ah traitor muttered dartagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix	186.6108
he lodges at the hôtel des princes	101.4890
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht	92.3587
feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline	187.3925
danglars will not fight with me i will kill his soninlaw cavalcanti will certainly fight the servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted	178.3446
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	298.2499
a duel was the pretext for my wound	167.6471
on seeing him the regiment of corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered charenton flying	166.0290
in the first place there is a little _intrigante_ named bonacieux she is in the prison of nantes that is to say she was there replied milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent to a convent said the duke	87.7360
what has become of monseigneur athos asked he	106.5826
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it	60.2250
a poet is as good as an abbé	58.8904
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do	48.5886
you do not understand asked felton	143.8402
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet	340.9953
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze	136.5925
but go on signing said monte cristo i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary	96.4630
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him	132.5328

de morcerf as the officer fernand mondegoindeed i do cried haydée	1370.7725
oh misery oh vanity you take it however yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle	209.2099
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinals decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only the deputies bowed and left the room	141.9244
the man of meung replied dartagnan and disappeared	58.5666
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him	412.4513
sir said valentine i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i diemy grandfather and maximilian i will watch over them as i have over you well sir do as you will with me and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me whatever may happen valentine do not be alarmed though you suffer though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin	183.8185

well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing them impossible cried the king the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain lord leven are you certain of it sir i heard it with my own ears the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands	174.5470
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me silence me me me said nanette	606.2615
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos	92.7580
on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flagstone	1014.9731
my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me	293.3338
years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present	201.8149
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m	296.1296
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers	304.7248
then i will go to the governor of algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier i will tell him my gloomy story	208.6730
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged	235.2577
money and sanctity each in a moiety elisabeth de rossan marquise de ganges was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv	328.9123
this adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lockup cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured	378.0634
come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain lecleres instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	192.5182
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	151.7415
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor	565.5575
would not that dress please you what do you mean asked mercédès with an angry glancewhat do you mean	91.2394
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again	140.6660
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution ah said athos how much time we have lost now said the king give the word and let us start will you not give it sire asked athos	91.6435
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him	155.6138
john felton i trust your word john felton i put faith in your loyalty my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance	165.0831
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite	389.9794
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight	142.6319
dartagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly	90.6431
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	79.9249
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès	188.5709
we shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former life these last words fell on mousqueton like a thunderbolt	328.9399
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressingroom	112.1240
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end horrible ejaculated the priest	159.3068
will you dine with me asked harrison of dartagnan	344.1274
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog and yet meyou see plainly that i love you you say so i am an honorable man you say so i am a gallant fellow i believe it i am brave oh i am sure of that then put me to the proof mme	83.3580
at length they arrived at the famous room	123.3701
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this edmond dantès this dangerous mans name was edmond dantès	178.9459
dartagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying	172.6960
adieu i also intend from this time to work on my own account	58.9601
and now you are assembled gentlemen said dartagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word _apologies_ a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis	113.3051
ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	34.4305
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended	151.3376
and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herselfof no one but herself	456.1211
no no exclaimed debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave	132.8613
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance	711.3672
me keep quiet while my master is being arrested he the support the liberator the father of the people ah well yes you have to know me yet	119.4160
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects yes madame chatillon stammered out	361.4575
i am not yet twentyone and eugénie is only seventeen but the two months expire next week	554.2081
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	290.7887
he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within	169.4734
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	224.9463
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room	129.0742
what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the saintemarguérite islands	388.7972
it was time for just as i jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a manofwar	250.6657
need we think of that since we are to save the king	53.7075
noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	326.5110
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a cry	39.8197
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos	83.7160
so that he told me that poor monsieur maillard go find the coadjutor friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir say then father bazinthe heir of monsieur maillard the giver of holy water at saint eustache hey i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms all the same i should like to do him that servicewhat do you say to it i will tell the coadjutor said bazin	179.5073
emmanuel and that his business was with m	96.2782
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	170.8073
what is he waiting for asked another	2526.6416
i admire i love himfor i know his former adventuresbut i shall not speak to him until the day after tomorrow and why day after tomorrow asked madame de chevreuse	87.6569
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m	65.3646
i shall be on the kings left and as i am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left your eminence may be perfectly easy replied dartagnan they will not touch a hair of your head deuce take it he thought to himself how can i take care of both	135.1087
creek to the east in a right line	279.5308
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner	54.5008
moreover dartagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character	162.9693
oh i cannot behold this frightful spectacle said he	218.8752
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions	1251.1923
something more terrible more fatal more alarming for usthe child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villeforts hands exclaimed my child was alive said she you buried my child alive	220.5569
the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks	253.2988
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries	289.5999
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated	414.0873
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor _ma foi_ we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from haydée why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i domost decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchampvisit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so	129.6465
danglars said another sign in the negative	141.4089
come sir wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other key go and fetch it i will leave you the torch sir no take it away i can see in the dark why you are like no	98.6600
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m	58.6002
bonacieux who was ignorant that dartagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m	216.4553
sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duckanddrake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz	350.4276
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world your valise is then empty asked porthos with simplicity	376.2572
a fine and white stocking a silken robe a lace kerchief a pretty slipper on the foot a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty but they make a pretty woman beautiful without reckoning the hands which gain by all this the hands among women particularly to be beautiful must be idle	385.8895
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	144.6159
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet him the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses	85.2374
be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the cellar	179.6038
another possessed all mercédès heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead	338.0246
my husband could accompany me but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek	138.2428
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms	114.4798
whats your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de luniversite	225.5777
she sat down took edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom	206.9021
mazarin came within three steps of dartagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place	205.3495
aramis at this movement drew his sword	14.8981
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it	123.2766
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum	479.2314
monsieur porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five nevertheless said dartagnan the people are bowing very low to this person as he spoke he rode toward the tall horseto the man of importance and his valets	287.4393
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and grimaud was posted as sentinel	235.8203
it is running now dartagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever	120.0157
it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling	158.3280
in fact four men such as they werefour men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single pointmust inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem	611.9528
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him	359.1037
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular	125.1266
i shall meet with a victim	871.6921
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house	170.4578
another and a magnificent one cried the host	56.7114
go on as i entered nîmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned	799.1323
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice	137.6877
monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment	105.5846
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head	38.0307
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored oneblood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess	249.8152
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours	253.9591
i tell you one of them was saying that if coysel predicted that tis as good as true i know nothing about it but i have heard say that hes not only an astrologer but a magician deuce take it friend if hes one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so why because he may be tried for it ah absurd they dont burn sorcerers nowadays no	331.9593
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the _mazzolata_ still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple	181.6487
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place	164.0536
dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him	327.4040
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	118.1267
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	209.7817
in june the profit amounted to	1.5527
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	227.7691
de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	86.3524
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	102.9184
but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now merciful heavens besides mother why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed	117.8948
there was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body	58.2072
he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold de winter turned and followed the direction of aramiss finger	221.2835
a great man in every country m	282.8468
the timely arrival of dartagnan in paris	65.0231
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it you ought to be satisfied if your majesty is so said tréville we are oh yes i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of dartagnan	72.6285
just then the sound of fingernails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edwards room valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated the lock turned and the door slowly opened	149.7092
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning	54.3969
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m	273.1729
why what good would it do asked caderousse	96.9789
here i have brought mine with me replied albert	69.9353
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled	394.9063
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending	137.1937
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass	111.1159
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with franknessfor then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth	113.0339
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	80.1951
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away oh mon dieu my dear mr mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me you know not then anything of your birthyou have never seen your mother yes my lord she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurses house i remember the last time she came as well as if it were today you have a good memory said mazarin	133.3691
barrois will open the door for you said valentine addressing morrel	139.3381
general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared	155.1780
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the _pharaon_ is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars	151.5014
i beg you will remove your bandage it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirtyeight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle	168.3003
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my friend apprised me of your coming and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune	146.0881
a thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected and rising also he went off at a quick pace	139.3208
the fool the ass the idiot how so if he loved her asked dartagnan	125.6878
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the partition	643.6017
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franchecomte	573.8198
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth dartagnans confidence stopped there	333.6093
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where davrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief	118.7364
however im glad not to fight them until tomorrow	493.6386
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis	156.4703
but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me	143.4171
you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of albert de morcerf	70.9629
the cardinals refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence	151.2250
but why have two of each sort asked danglars	463.6012
with me you will be as safe as in a temple i give you my word of a gentleman let us go said she i place full confidence in you my friend dartagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered dartagnans chambers	137.6487
my sister is happily married her husband is only my brotherinlaw that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life	205.4674
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war	53.0999
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison	143.4069
yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit	189.4876
do you hear said the king	23.7037
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved	698.4172
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	231.6650
if the abbé busoni should by any accident return think of me in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in a few days true but that makes no difference	209.6342
the attention which we have been obliged to give during the commencement of the chapter to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it has diverted us for an instant from him to whom anne of austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal and who confounded unknown lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors looked on at this scene comprehensible only to four personsthe king the queen his eminence and himself	171.8079
he is my master and i am his slave he has the right to notice nothing the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy	95.2059
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two years do you think so said mercédès	112.0089
what do you mean by that nothing my lord monsieur dartagnan belongs to the service monsieur dartagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs you are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city tis that exactly	132.6177
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon	115.6181
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward mme	295.4316
a real father yes so long as he pays me youll honor and believe himthats right	711.7815
de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult	316.2054
give up broussel she cried fine counsel indeed	3867.7434
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river	128.5042
what wounded man the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by spaniards and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the host	203.5457
he let off his fire at but four paces	250.2041
monsieur is i am sure an honest man take away that fool said the cardinal	100.7769
emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to fiveandtwenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rosetree raised her head	343.0217
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england	59.2631
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine	114.6949
these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercédès coloring	134.7025

by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness	908.3699

i am fifteen years younger than he is	40.6974
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion	121.4747

dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	339.2688

madame de villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but i cant be severe with him he is really _so_ bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m	205.7072

he began gathering the grapeleaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener	113.7524
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here	124.0920

dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	52.6912
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect	491.1756

and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them there	63.3190
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château dif and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery	165.7440
there was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir	296.2607
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	324.8413
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	292.8586
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie	116.6558
de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochinchina oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly	154.3526

a great age you mean monsieur porthos	90.8696
read for yourself and judge porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur dartagnan who must follow the bearer well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied dartagnan	81.7888
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	195.0774
a gascon a match for cupid the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by dartagnan at last arrived	262.3015
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment	358.2643
yes it was so my lord it was soin the left side and with a knife	110.3582
she saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass	272.2512
choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere as long as i dont fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight	43.7634
did you come to noisy to defend him i am waiting for no one replied dartagnan who was beginning to be angry	43.9077
what was most clear in the matter was that dartagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all	67.3848
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing	198.1923
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dantès and i only see a halfburnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure of which from this day forth onehalf belongs to you the sweat started forth on dantès brow	197.0107
well i shall write to the abbé i shall hold him responsible for his _protégés_ misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination	207.0438
from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of teresa and had sworn she should be his	107.8608

when the soldier saluted charles athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket	269.3908
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power	188.5014
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated	73.7882
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones patrons i hope to be captain without that said dantès	118.9614
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abbé edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abbé edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la réserve oh yes i can see it all before me this moment was it not his betrothal feast it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested yes and up to this point i know all said the priest	119.5538
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i brotherinlaw of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr	128.2270
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	209.4410
indeed why you knew it porthos said aramis	77.9151
the gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain	553.2443
the valet de chambre announced m	148.3364
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	174.1441
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream	453.1105
her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused	93.3882
from the top of an eminence dartagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur	139.9747
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick exclaimed fool then enclosing monte cristos receipt in a little pocketbook he addedyes come at twelve oclock i shall then be far away then he doublelocked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in banknotes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne danglars i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured	387.2139
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer	205.9343
he entered and on his way met the waiter	315.5174
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian	164.4920
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance	384.6473
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar	85.3439
aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishops place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall	388.7889
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimneypiece he said today is the st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly halfpast ten oclock	154.0902
moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with glory	241.9279
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag	572.1510
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathit does not come alone listen	326.9341
dartagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains	750.9169
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse you know resumed dartagnan that she has had leave to return to france yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice oh this time returned aramis i havent seen her she is much changed in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance	152.8418
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear dartagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray dartagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure	117.4208
instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine _strychnos colubrina_ as the learned term it	801.0731
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings	179.4885
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him	135.3309
dartagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was	242.6190
dartagnan shows himself as athos and porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour dartagnan returned	64.2117
as for me it made me tremble	108.3568
halloo major tell them to order number to come downstairs the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a manhe became a number	240.8992
well said beauchamp we shall see our friend yes indeed replied debray	133.5514
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heartstrings	418.9431
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours	248.5520
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses	97.0651
carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence	337.5966
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers	854.8423
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path ah here is de winter coming said athos	172.4979
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on	144.8100
oh no there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu i dont even know their names yes but in regard to myself my lord it cannot be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence you think you were i am certain of it ah stay i fancy i remember it	87.2103
you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can you no i really cannot well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it	359.2325
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	106.6410
they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious	548.6176
good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	345.3946
on the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising	643.5176
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	199.0353
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess	179.1563
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to parisso that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed	195.5474
oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars	168.8245
what is this gentlemans name asked the commissary	74.2634
a thousand livres for my part i declare i want two thousand four times two makes eight then said aramis it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the saddles besides said athos waiting till dartagnan who went to thank monsieur de tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend	143.2320
yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heartone can only love onceand did you ever see her again m never never i never returned to the country where she lived to malta yes malta she is then now at malta i think so and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer heryes but only her do you then still hate those who separated you i hate them	243.3012

he had made up his mind to write to her the next day	40.4880
will said the notary it is very evident that m	33.1602
i have two friends who in this way never depart from me the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me	247.2754
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not your mission is not accomplished exclaimed dartagnan looking in astonishment at athos	117.0457
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude	193.6226
are there any magistrates or judges at the château dif there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls	270.7564
de villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless how useless cried the president what do you mean i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me	107.3778
cavalcanti as the counts father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres	277.0757
that is my answer the answer was terrible	477.6488
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them	148.0776
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting	110.7882
a great favor zounds monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin no matter said dartagnan in his most wheedling tone	88.2632
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction	224.8164
eh no do not surrender egad on the contrary be off and quickly	200.1172
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	125.1978
and as i am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once i estimated it at a thousand pistoles i hope said dartagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses and even money to pay our expenses on the road athos you make me tremble cried dartagnan	136.2565
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort	97.6580
i always knew you were a good son and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence dantès smiled	102.4858
de tréville requested athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his comrades	106.2629
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	365.0197
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy you madame said dartagnan affecting surprise is that possible my godgood and beautiful as you are a mortal enemy indeed an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death	125.2219
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a threecornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity	168.4873
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours	238.4676
it was aramis who broke the silence	88.1026
i was there too and i never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	180.0464

truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed	246.4716
dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him	407.0802
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m	163.0932
well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting	97.0440
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry	259.7850
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	213.9942

ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the postchaise and the horses to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st angelo	341.8793
while waiting his assistance i trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her	119.2072

danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile	297.2536
i remember now yes it was aboutstop a minuteyes it was about a woman thats it replied athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk yes that was it said dartagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes yes who was hanged by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued dartagnan looking intently at athos	121.9040
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation	215.9828
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel	278.2231
faith you are indeed right not to return to it	41.8097
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles	152.6175
i will see the queen i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt ignorant	60.9836
tis a long time since i saw thee come come dartagnan said athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears in your eyes	118.4583
hes not more cunning than de richelieu was devil take him then he said aloud the queen my lord	85.6716
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices	263.9554
there will be eleven crowns gained it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in dartagnans purse	183.4951
the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand	27.6256
dartagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before	126.0806
those two words _your mass_ and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer i sir	108.4148
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh	142.4129

ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you	84.4461
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	131.7783
come haydée come and throwing his arm around the young girls waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared	69.6985
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the cloverpatch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty	92.1737
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards me	154.5785
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger	152.5259
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the parkhunting perhaps no nearer nearer still	475.9865
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep	108.6570
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing	174.5821
be tranquil murmured milady i will avenge youand cruelly _peste_ said dartagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come it took some time for dartagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished	220.0723

i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly	187.2966
yes he has entered it is for you or me my god how agitated you seem yes i admit it	114.2685
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	70.5788
dartagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character	282.8265

but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	119.7027

thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark	131.5648
porthos told him of it in his calm manner	163.7522

and now let everyone retire must i go too asked valentine timidly	339.9460
dartagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed	382.0345
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchengarden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation	1083.4214
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he reentered the hôtel and flew toward kittys chamber	153.6714
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it offin small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed	207.9146

danglars himself announced must i receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance because said andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness i thought i heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve months	191.7767
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy	195.3427

he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	28.9930
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	54.8631

oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	103.8352

the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville	182.4459
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that dartagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place	154.0628

these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been	100.0162

he had the resolution to stop with this	96.8499
yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it	132.2796
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude	1493.0411
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	113.4521
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile	270.3806

_monsieur and dear friend_ ah yes _dear friend_ to an englishman interrupted athos well commenced bravo dartagnan only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel well perhaps	357.5858
what is it said the musketeers	423.5416
dartagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his wishes	64.5413
but you madame you appear to be free continued the novice and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of france with which i am unacquainted and where i have never been before oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being persecuted hear me said the novice we must trust in heaven	127.2068
as to dartagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive	283.9546
i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan	128.0709
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground	19.2399

but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility	693.0495
the contract was read during a profound silence	202.8562
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the kings attorney and this kings attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly	87.7516
let him have itlet him have it she said	114.2616

of course you stopped at your fathers a feeling of faintness came over villefort	276.2224
personally i do not know you this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	180.8171
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my friend yes but i confess i always thought you jested with such things oh dartagnan the devil why people jest with death and people are wrong dartagnan for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation granted but if you please let us not theologize aramis	161.8286
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her the young and highspirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath	206.5513

an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	130.4529
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours	115.4105
thats true said he quietly for my part i have never loved acknowledge then you stony heart said dartagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts tender hearts pierced hearts said athos	257.9030

penelon replied julie go and inform m	904.0475
goodmorning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m	202.0529
on perceiving the count he rose quickly	316.3712
dartagnan interpreted it with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of cahusac crying to me monsieur guardsman i will slay you cahusac turned	325.2272
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done	81.2471
noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild	159.5860
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	175.5486
a _rondeau_ said the curate mechanically	12673.4395

it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	152.1801
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind	36.2810
_la jeune amélie_ was first at the rendezvous	77.1952

monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter	80.3577
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by châteaurenaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel	81.7328
then dartagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers	51.3477
de tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his word	165.7564

the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance	61.9993
but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highnesss yataghan to pieces the bey yielded and agreed to forgive the hand and head but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis	388.9154

i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us	272.1209
dartagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercers pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing	99.0101
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn	63.7434
athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted	94.9886
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	183.1196
dartagnan turned to look at his friends	70.1538
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	101.2544
perhaps all blood demands some expiation	34441.5703
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	140.9694
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church the mendicant shook his head	86.7514
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder	145.2284
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required	135.4368
villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight	245.6023
you are quite upset come come tell me i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness athos said dartagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheardof story well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend	223.5584

de monte cristos friend i was not sure but i thought it might be so	37.5007
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune	115.6375
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsars podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a halfdilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin	294.0495
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me	169.2690
her pose which i must admit was rather free wounded this officer	779.3202
athos lend me grimaud who in the society of his friend parry has perhaps picked up a little english and can act as my interpreter go grimaud said athos	149.0743
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections but god forgive me cried anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her i believe that you are yourself interrogating yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur dartagnandartagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman	134.0734
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly	117.0616
he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious	221.3925
there is still something else said he	18.5411
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos	938.3096
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion	117.9721
morrel i know there was no one in fault but destiny	278.9415
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes	64.5036
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain thatand i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight i worked at night also replied faria	184.1653
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful	150.3871
once for all tréville had placed his stable at dartagnans service	229.1264
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker	64.6169
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions	249.4154
franz the eyes repeated several times no no no then you are vexed with the engagement yes well listen said valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfathers neck i am vexed too for i do not love m	93.1051
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian	227.1031
oh sir exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him it is his son dartagnans arm dropped to his side	79.8499
the races like the _moccoli_ are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	81.5693
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris do you hesitate asked mazarin	117.3075
devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing i havent seen you with so cheerful a face these five years the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramees ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him	98.3097
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	114.8368
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak	192.5269
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties how is it all the better yes for his eminence will give you all that you wantland money and titles ah ah ah said porthos opening his eyes at that last word	107.8067
at precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah	265.2175
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened	277.7818
wait what are you going to do asked aramis	32.6516
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart	147.9789
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss	115.9740
at the moment he reentered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing	104.6851
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs	45.0839
what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions were	497.1316

once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two posthorses	564.0649
de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed	314.6693

everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination	146.8712
dartagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarins anteroom	114.6599
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said athos	68.0183
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut la carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it yes your excellency	138.8882

when arrived there the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all	101.3422
there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows but then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position both sirhe has both fortune and positionboth this must be impossible it would seem so but listen and you will understand	304.3300

debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with gold	121.1543
luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time	512.7728
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive ah monsieur and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage ah monsieur planchet began to weep	211.3388
the three presents of dartagnan the elder chapter ii	265.1035
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	115.2786
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	139.6603
haydée scarcely had the counts horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughtermuch too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural	160.9953
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned	275.5251
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors	439.9816
welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friends ransom that this had happened but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscounti do not see him nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly	101.3550
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder	384.7975
i pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me	693.3275

mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred	206.3910
de trévilles clock threequarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twentyfive minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon you twentyfive minutes past nine cried m	131.8835
waiter said danglars pen ink and paper pen ink and paper muttered fernand	232.9520

ah sir he exclaimed it was you without you i was a dead manthrice dead but one recovers sir as you perceive replied raoul and we have but had a little bath oh sir what gratitude i feel exclaimed the man with gray hair	192.2623
albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	226.0892
but such is man we always want something more than we already have what does porthos wish for to be a baron ah true i forgot said athos laughing	136.2033
de villefort is here well he comes to fetch his wife and daughter why so because madame de saintméran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m	92.3869
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos	89.7517
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbélike all other abbés and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royaleegad you know about it was i not your second cried dartagnan	116.2048
athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw	395.2754
go the musketeers set off and dartagnan was left alone with raoul	116.8965
it must be nearly four oclock	20.8894
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	124.1722
he is in a very picturesque placedo you know the catacombs of st sebastian i was never in them but i have often resolved to visit them well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better	100.8115
ah if we had been five murmured athos thinking of dartagnan and porthos	186.0896
de tréville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend you will do me honor monsieur said dartagnan	113.8445
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale	57.8273
tell me he saidtell me what you want well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back andrea turned pale but said nothing	86.6029
thank you thank you murmured she	100.1393
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said dartagnan	96.2905
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	66.2740
i know it and the duke put the quill to the paper	101.6442
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	369.9485
as we have said he was lying on the deck	76.1023
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo	100.5530
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy	161.2179
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis	96.2245
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice	199.3107
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible then m	271.7975
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened horace muttered _justum et tenacem propositi virum_ m	4718.4795
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m	153.4169
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars	102.5372
the confidence with which dartagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister	177.2099
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came	292.4977
it was now one oclock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home	31.3844
could you let me hire a horse of you an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad	204.9285
never mind be content i will do my best	50.4349
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	589.4813
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfathers look at that moment would more than compensate for all dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what isabring right and left among the bedouinscan have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels	186.6645
at least you dont speak well of him that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim but this letter in which he recommends you to me is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites but why have you not fled whither should i go	100.4286
on this paved yard are to be seenpacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadowsthe men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening	759.1431
dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed	59.2140
his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house	67.0653
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people	159.9077
expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd m	97.5597
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand	74.1169
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly	379.8105
to remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her plan	252.7874
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell	128.7630
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve	303.8668
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered	101.8085
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the _pharaon_	80.6680
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness but your eminence replied the prince	104.1812
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her	214.9916
tell me quickly my time is not my own monsieur said dartagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it it is indeed a favor young man replied m	100.6354
he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercédès	116.9537
silence said dartagnan pressing her hand more closely	95.3705
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble	618.6206
from time to time parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but charles would open his eyes and say with a smile go on my good parry i am listening groslow advanced to the door of the kings room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to dartagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved	144.9793
franz and the count got into the carriage	22.1635
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	19.0404
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully	87.1763
two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly	953.1677
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	218.8651
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master	115.8781
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed	97.0288
it is not your father or madame de villefort who is ill	46.5532
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive dartagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but but what asked anne of austria	86.5106
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has refused	122.0070
he saw that he was on the highest point of the islanda statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam	198.4743
they are beating the general alarm the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	166.3650
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you she said	116.0663
no he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there	232.3026
here he is a man of about fortyfive or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him	150.4937
the consequence is that when i saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours i had recourse to a little of my old trade	275.1308
eh give it to me said the young man	8.3093
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	88.4563
m no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor	244.4485
this was the more so because bonacieuxs reflections were all rosecolored	5901.5483
quite certain said milady with a last doubt	183.5768
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the swiss	82.4108
he had received in the chest the bullet of dartagnans first adversary	580.2943
oh now i may say so so much the better replied monte cristo as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you	67.1251
the parliament we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament both orleans and montargis are ours	400.7050
de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m	1123.5972
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	131.0895
the glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him	205.8704
above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast seabird	351.5285
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune	55.3719
i accept it interposed dartagnan proudly	8853.7578
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him yes your excellency andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	126.6564
you will put yourself at the head of the first	17.5352
all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur dartagnan is doubtless true said the queen but i have confidence in you alone	72.1520
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris	79.0445
well asked athos when he had closed the letter	45.7202
he was accompanied by two of the yachts crew	1280.4182
de trévillea request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due season	248.4487
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real	183.5405
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized	135.5645
if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame if you cross a bridge feel every plank of it with your foot lest one should give way beneath you if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head if you stay out late be always followed by your lackey and let your lackey be armedif by the by you can be sure of your lackey	253.0868
what do they say that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing what nonsense said franz reseating himself	815.2972
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	329.9221
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandits dinner through the crevices of the doormay i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goatskin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy	157.3644
she opened it quickly and read go this moment to the allées de meilhan enter the house no ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father	116.3742
this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox	440.3550
what is the matter if you please sir replied mordaunt i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging wherefore sir	109.4809
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me i was wrong a hundred times wrong	178.7422
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant	103.9133
if you can be satisfied with my dinnerit consists of cooked tetragones and fruits what do you mean by tetragones asked dartagnan uneasily	471.2242
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses danglars took advantage of caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saintvictor staggering as he went	223.9450
however scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor reentered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there louis xviiis halffilled snuffboxscarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	445.7461
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady	164.5100
why three days ago the emperor had not landed no matter i was aware of his intention how did you know about it by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba to me to you and which i discovered in the pocketbook of the messenger	62.4112
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	74.2577
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by dartagnans inventive imagination	184.5864
he had passed the night standing and without sleep	465.0785
the letters were longthe four pages were covered with closely written words	492.9515
do you think of him yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans what are you saying	248.4783
mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of saintméran i say hers for she inherits it today	682.6009
do you think it will be long before he comes in no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock well i will go and take a turn in the champsélysées and at ten oclock i will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin	74.3103
the three gentlemen took the road to picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to athos and aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth	122.1567
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that dartagnan had not come to béthune	94.0229
on the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were necessary what does he say grumbled porthos	102.1861
he was very successful upon that question	166.8165
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight	131.7045
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea	97.6004
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point	139.5899
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times	81.5230
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage	134.2310
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father it is well returned the voice tomorrow these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall	114.5884
bonacieux it is a man i dont know although he seems to be coming here	77.6644
it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer the clouds which m	474.8967
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are lost	223.7968
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back	96.0396
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not replied m	98.0677
de tréville and ran quickly up the stairs	52.1089
listen said morcerfif mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement	228.8513
dartagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out	35.4389
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris	110.9611
you are a nobleminded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me	157.3688
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life	87.4479
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself	75.5072
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted	340.1620
oh enough of thisenough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb	201.6644
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers	138.4062
have you anything to ask of me	32.4682
well at twentynine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife	89.2956
the young men first approached the dead man	26.8083
what is to happen said porthos	21.9603
the cardinal therefore rose to open it	98.3689
follow us at a distance of twenty paces as far as the louvre and if anyone watches us slay him dartagnan placed his naked sword under his arm allowed the duke and mme	212.2142
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting	59.1234
take her six bottles of different winecyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters get them at borels and be sure you say they are for me at what oclock sir do you breakfast m what time is it now a quarter to ten very well at half past ten	260.3218
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window	203.9781
here is my pass countersigned said the latter	22.3526
in an instant dartagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes	96.3710
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction	2641.8982
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only	113.4184
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	59.0589
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop	984.4937
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villarscotterets	348.5434
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	211.1843
oh the train is well laid the plot is clever	1009.5892
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you	509.8772
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe	248.0000
the count de rochefort grimaud nodded the third time	108.2863
and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	147.7571
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton	196.4071

i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence	274.4632
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble	125.1901
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos	183.3267

whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered	158.2114

the baron dépinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him	75.1300
seeing dartagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes	68.8879
well then he deputes me to give you this am i to consider this as part of my income on account no it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris ah how good my dear father is silence said monte cristo he does not wish you to know that it comes from him i fully appreciate his delicacy said andrea cramming the notes hastily into his pocket	103.0197

madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself	157.4881
at four oclock dartagnan recommenced his journey	95.1018
come speak monsieur de cavois monsieur de cavois in person the captain of the cardinals guards himself did he come to arrest me i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling manner was he so sweet then indeed he was all honey monsieur indeed he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palaisroyal it was called the palaiscardinal before richelieu gave it to the king	103.5268
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover	1649.2734

it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation	265.8903
de monte cristo king of china emperor of cochinchina said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister	1400.8079
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenica bon mot which had great success	477.5629
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawingroom and went to open the door himself	43.0653
the two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them	132.4259
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness	84.4389
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two menhow do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented	311.3197
at halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times you think so my lord answered la ramee	230.9359

the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked bertuccio	133.6953
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort ah i understand replied porthos she has ordered relays of horses exactly so and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said dartagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction	86.4972
so he cherishes no resentment you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	35.7625
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	155.4895
yes before witnesses oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it there has been a crime said monte cristo	67.3635
spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence	69.1299
as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap	86.5086
de bernet were exiled and laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant	85.2733
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage	238.6136
come dartagnan said porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds to bracieux or to du vallon	175.5552
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardeshe whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governors country house so it is said dartagnan i know him now	118.7271
it was there a lodging was prepared for them	66.2876
there is but little reason why i should delay you	148.2352
bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m	32.1184
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror	231.8642
of danglars yes to be sure must i say baron danglars	220.4186
dartagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts	636.8887
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	291.6808
oh it is impossibleyou must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve	249.2760
so _au revoir_ dear athos _au revoir_ said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought	130.1673
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus	102.9669
we shall be carried in triumph in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion	107.1177
butand i say it with some pride mercédèsgod needed me and i lived	787.6318
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little progress	268.3941
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked dartagnan	71.3506
she has met mademoiselle de villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis	262.8819
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else	204.2496
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses	70.5675
the rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis	136.3760
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart go monsieur de bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed	113.3754
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe	116.0871
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	60.2645
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible	87.9277
de villeforts in connection with his attachment for valentine	1463.7799
near the louvre the four friends met with m	81.9577
making no reply grimaud opened the poor mans jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid	156.4380
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle	370.6997
pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little this evening you said well this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend	118.4805
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter	153.4308
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimneypiece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings	238.3321
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself	176.6349
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy	284.0536
the deed if you please mr notary and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors	129.6737
when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution	364.6123
m yes you cried franz whose hair stood on end you m	205.4716
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy	1111.3835
sire go leave france to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of arcola marengo austerlitz tell him this gérard or rather tell him nothing	248.8315
what next de wardes cannot boast of anything how is that	88.0097
noirtier is desirous of making his will yes yes yes motioned the invalid	376.5214
yes here it is who is this athos one of my friends but if he should be at home and see me he is not at home and i will carry away the key after having placed you in his apartment but if he should return oh he wont return and if he should he will be told that i have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his apartment but that will compromise me sadly you know of what consequence	76.7647
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and davrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child davrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish	104.3433
noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy	179.8791
mazarin is better lodged said aramis	26.7370
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and dartagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling	95.2111
the two friends turned down the first street they came to	78.3495
danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular	193.6828
holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet	137.6615
then i will add two words about the young greek girl monte cristo motioned him to be silent	95.8625
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness	156.2433
come will you do today what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen i will do everything your majesty commands replied dartagnan	84.7511
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket	86.6965
the affair at armentieres whispered dartagnan	10.8097
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	104.5221
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it	125.7506
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	311.6713
speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise the queen said dartagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended	131.4985
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend	58.9588
the jailer always brought dantès soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first	249.2907
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen anne looked at dartagnan anxiously	126.9314
i am getting more and more seasick go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet	773.4827
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	343.9016
bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low	202.7588
the clock of the invalides struck one	321.3625
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter	58.2935
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable	176.9620
come said athos heres another good servant	190.2044
for my part i wash my hands of the affair so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather	162.3351
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m	261.0959
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison	112.9689
ah my yellow horse cried he	14.9427
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly	11996.7402
at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account well albert inquired franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall quite so said albert if the way be picturesque the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared	169.1061
except your signature and your partners m	5712.8135
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond	88.4044
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	176.6686
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything wrong undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish	136.2787
from the depth of my heart said gondy	123.7790
i will bless youi i am dying cried mordaunt come to me come to me dartagnan began to be touched	62.6793
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his fathers enemies	168.6959
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidlysomething vexes youis it not so m nothing answered the baroness	716.9445
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	592.7777
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	467.5190
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will	74.4193
you think then said he that i am taken to the château dif to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m	91.0576
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a musicroom for julie who never played	549.1859

monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced	175.8970
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you	21.1187

in whom can i trust place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger but i must write oh yes that is indispensable	123.8679
dartagnan therefore returned to the rue férou	177.3017

acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession	166.7673
dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror	103.9121
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter	112.1370

once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten banknotes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all	378.8121
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you	103.7178

heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured	163.0850
eat heartily grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it	86.8894
you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancinghe is advancing said louis xviii	191.3763

franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal	125.1682

let us leave them she said	23.1943
there is here no question of crime or treason	387.1655
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges	779.0033
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m	58.8852
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously	100.6118
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold	86.6641
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican bandits and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another	214.2646
the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose	528.7133
their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when dead yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything	159.6350
his task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him	206.4024

at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind dartagnan	177.7997
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire fire then when the shot was fired	114.9494
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant	87.5995
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came	132.4916
in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides	272.5168
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate	101.2423
the man of meung chapter xv	1911.2074
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way	368.3989
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton	236.4593
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration	169.8796
dartagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly	177.3710
but continued dartagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window	81.9129
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch but will it not be lost oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up a gardener grimaud nodded	134.1798
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man	57.2768
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have them a horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my friend ah madame said porthos haughtily do you take me for a beggar no i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules	169.2750
the countess said morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive	67.6985
from fifty to sixty musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for anything	283.7337
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended	84.2905
peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened	464.8142
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady	123.6639
dartagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles	95.5182
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion	289.7976
let me have some dinner at once what would your excellency like and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars	151.3938
now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs i shall still have my place no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondents message oh sir what are you proposing a jest sir unless you force me i think i can effectually force you and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket	136.0425
what will monsieur de tréville say	643.1115
we have nothing to fear from those who love us you speak very suddenly of love monsieur said the young woman shaking her head	96.2707
come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow morning vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage	69.2423
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	65.6203
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall thinkfor how do i know to the contrarythat this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it i will come counti will be sure to come said villefort eagerly	225.2859
youyou said the young man looking fearfully around him	357.4774
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle	383.7921
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out whos there and dartagnan answeredhaving first asked the word of the cardinallouis and rocroy after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost	580.6741
the _agamemnon_ of aeschylus is based on this legend	827.0364
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence	164.5171
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me shall you not go with the queen no replied mazarin	66.7708
it would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos	174.1928
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert	72.7098
no you sounded me nothing more	62.1750
i am no swordsman well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter	65.8239
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale	254.6627
as to dartagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again return immediately to parisj	104.0274
debray had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong madame	94.2598
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window	57.4021
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple questionnothing only i want it julie made a pretence to feel for the key	166.6943
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip	205.4502
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis	306.1952
one only is still not in our power and braves us	321.6563
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast	599.1644
danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m	45.7547
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong and both again left the room	58.8704
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice	280.3877
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	338.0846
this arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever	95.9262
royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	357.7373
he was armed at all points	1869.9645
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another	70.4260
do you wish for any further details	1048.8335
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv no you are right my dear rochefort it couldnt be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon ah indeed i forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know	145.6390
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly	526.0685
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here an enemy cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin	92.9516
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity	4938.5430
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown	138.1854
this doctor has a niece continued aramis	130.6820
what a proposition i thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up indeed said the receiver	336.3601
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him	172.7862
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself ah ah can it be on account of the amours of madame de boistracy said dartagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs	100.6641
now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors	97.5830
my son exclaimed athos pressing him in his arms	25.4659
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched	132.2822
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him	261.0035
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love	158.7702
she is ill great god she is losing her senses while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt	94.1974
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	234.7570
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock	76.8883
certainly i see him then i did not kill him really i think you are going mad good bertuccio said the count	45.6994
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	107.7366
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock	83.4159
his family will care much about such a trifle as that his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him	175.8136
before or after whichever you please opposite the scaffold the scaffold forms part of the _fête_ count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count	83.8489
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet	374.1830
sir said dartagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	181.9600
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from tours shaping their course toward spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn why really it was all exactly as you say cried madame de chevreuse clapping her hands	266.0656
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea a pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercédès herself	145.4193
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration	126.6801
have you seen the king yes and all goes well we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven it was then striking halfpast ten by st pauls	214.0639
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room	136.6234
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days	48.2809
albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well	112.4469
this was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and porthos	98.9126
m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	222.1712
what six of his eminences guards arrest six of his majestys musketeers _morbleu_ my part is taken i will go straight to the louvre i will give in my resignation as captain of the kings musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinals guards and if he refuses me _morbleu_ i will turn abbé at these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies	184.9365
they are yours take them mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at dartagnan with openmouthed astonishment	1616.1216
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act	111.4197
i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged ah so much the better exclaimed the king	168.4787
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears	139.9062
at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down	82.4941
what do you wish to say about it i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer	182.8543
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim m	114.6502
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	79.3868
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the first	193.4144
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m	51.2440
valentine hid her head between her hands	18.1269
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival	185.1941
no no said fernand restraining him stay it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès	109.2583
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes	93.4660
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah ah exclaimed rochefort	90.6723
he knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	363.2794
come raoul he said let us follow this man the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst athos and raoul descended	224.7868
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you but no said valentineno i tell you it is all past and it was nothing	82.0370
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after fiveandtwenty years of exile	161.0050
at last he heard the voice of la ramee	38.5058
the other day a bankers clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold caderousse was filled with wonder the young mans words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis	157.1686
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me	53.2538
our former life has it still no attractions for you	524.3087
well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman haydée my slave thinks me a greek	308.0618
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	68.7607
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me oh cried andrea leaping with joy	87.2627
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses	208.1968
she loves him devilishly he murmured	487.8640
but were you not on horseback	192.4584
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france	174.0500
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i dont know how long to the amount of or francs during the year	111.1648
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting	562.5999
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry	161.4341
then they looked at one another	159.9552
oh oh said dartagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer	127.7272
what is it the child conceals it but where did he find it in his mothers laboratory does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory how can i tell	327.8674
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz dépinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered	94.4689
m indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does	115.4886
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately	147.0767
the next morning at nine oclock he entered franzs room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days	340.6654
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	140.8820
what have you done with monsieur de bruy	304.9735
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else tis well danglarstis well replied m	398.9830
this is all very strange said m	65.7231
egad how strong one feels here said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands	231.5538
wretchedwretched that i am hallo catalan hallo fernand where are you running to exclaimed a voice	620.2357
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	117.7890
his reflections were not very cheerful	1462.5143
you are speaking you scoundrel said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look	157.0612
this morning i awoke at six oclock	37.8928
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse	36.7874
but you say you do not wish to kill me no and yet you will let me perish with hunger ah that is a different thing well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculationsi would rather die at once you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again as your excellency pleases said vampa as he left the cell	123.8565
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth	123.7134
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	353.8433
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs	141.4574
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	173.4949
my dear friends said dartagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners it was not long before they joined the escort	94.5932
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos	386.0981
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied dartagnan not to lead ones neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them dartagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute italian	219.2320
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god i will go said the monk	68.1274
no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne and shall we arrive there safe and sound as true as my names jack butler well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named	150.4851
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he reentered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment	184.2725
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god	143.4431
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	114.8368
do you expect news from him i expect himself himself	131.0569
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château dif he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	135.3054
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said	173.1870
do you understand me cried monte cristo	6.5920
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit	107.3384
then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled	125.2468
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative	433.9000
but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire	478.8051
he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear	134.2216
well i follow its course i track its passage i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes well oh speak speak doctor i shall have courage well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one	201.0703
te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout france	685.4150
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day	175.2179
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceedingif his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor	106.6619
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically	96.9856
certainly if miladys strength had been equal to her hatred mme	277.2482
i am entirely at your service except only for my orders thank you sir what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand	124.5013
eh i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do cried dartagnan	102.4966
he could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of grief	1794.6421
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing what are you saying asked the queen	98.3959
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything	70.9803
asmodeusthat diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiecewould have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saintgermaindesprés while debray was casting up his figures	255.5825
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted	406.7552
besides dartagnan has not told us his idea yet and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast	172.9839
free to leave me leave you	10.6780
let us visit this one first added he	136.1190
of these francs you took crowns	14406.7734
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her deathbed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel	122.5794
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed	694.9384
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself	144.8319
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society	132.7824
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of himsometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess	793.7638
follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskwhat is the form said he	228.0846
de villefort passed on to his own room	88.3639
she who mistaking you for the cardinals guards has just fled away your companion cried dartagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress	107.5905
hold theres a carriage coming over yonder then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name thats right	399.7533
what is it said dartagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance	163.0356
you cannot be mistaken there is but one afterward you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word forward which means in french _en avant_	210.2687
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii	1184.6389
you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriagecontract	140.4613
with regard to dartagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet	128.9234
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based	248.4219
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom	121.3463
in the name of heaven my lord cried mme	42.8796
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days to get married yes first and then to go to paris very good have what time you require dantès	135.0285
the two friends were perfectly stupefied	1715.5144
then he had a moments hesitation	1496.8485
come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit capital this evening with you tomorrow at stuarts the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said dartagnan	216.1699
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m	166.9100
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer	143.1381
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	273.9092
oh my former friends my former friends he murmured and fell with his face to the ground	86.8158
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand	321.2241
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph	135.0660
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said dartagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick dartagnan	74.4250
now will you make me a report of all that has happened why i have related the events to you	72.9925
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so goodnatured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year	193.4631
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saintgermaindesprés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person	102.6890
it was that paper you read this morning read it again dantès and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this th day of april be	342.9817
dartagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies	90.5556
give your orders have you kitchens here kitchensof coursecomplete ones and cooks excellent well a fowl fish gameit signifies little so that i eat as your excellency pleases	1533.0564
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwells	403.4236
but you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus	232.6024
dartagnan related his story simply with the omission of names	453.7918
is this corpse come to life already	1280.3969
m yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning	259.1646
what the devil makes him glower thus behind him when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity	226.5871
he concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majestys command	204.0762
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works	61.4410
what is your name my friend she said	24.9880
did you see him they all asked	526.7686
but to you dartagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend	190.9089
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone in the morning when they entered miladys chamber they had brought her breakfast	88.9301
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	219.5844
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc	482.8076
so thought the gascon heres a young blade who has already his love affair who doesnt at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex	253.2540
planchet met them hard by the shed	178.5440
i was blind athos has made me see thats all come here the two friends went near him	122.2061
may i at least return asked morrel	160.7693
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why	123.1006
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as dartagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time	171.4732
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait	79.5851
he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin	128.5789
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m	69.5757
de chevreuse who told it to two or three of her intimates that yielding to his vocation he had retired into a conventonly into which nobody knew	254.7882
but then your word is given yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not	75.3929
he tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through	170.7902
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly i am mate of the _pharaon_ belonging to messrs	89.2615
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	815.5745
marry forsooth people dont die of hunger here and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window	86.5858
he did so and thus doubled his income	821.9856
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt	276.0893
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women	455.1252
it was that of a man from five to eightandthirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries	183.9431
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination	202.1027
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent	220.7849
why not because he is an actor in the drama has he assassinated anyone then no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him	104.4836
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	198.9361
go now at once or i shall have you put out i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty	99.3890
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only servingman whom he had left	145.6966
dantès possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry	646.7884
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust	280.1381
do you think he would recollect you my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me well go and talk with the boy said dartagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible while dartagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts	139.4263
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinals death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand	151.3701
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass	68.8401
_pardieu_ replied dartagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables and i some lamb chops said porthos	959.4829
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which dartagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence	135.1415
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	122.9949
morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow	152.8628
i have only two adversariesi will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even themthey are time and distance	671.4541
whence have you these ideas of death you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your sonchallenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victoryyou do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live	124.4466
and will you sign the contract i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me	90.8993
when dartagnan returned to the palais royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing	110.4031
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	250.2867
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses morrel smiled	280.9455
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	195.9763
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this francs child sighed mercédès	395.7020
but doctor you see me already so grievedhow can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow	553.4908
give me those papers and leave us the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired	84.0782
at this very moment the court is making overtures to me hitherto i have repulsed them but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so ive a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now accept it my lord accept it said aramis	140.3050
you were rich when i married you but little respected	814.4590
had morrel been a more quicksighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the kings procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department	129.9803
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away	66.9916
m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	261.1368
the timely arrival of dartagnan in paris	65.0231
and i also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the place	104.2300
we dress the king in groslows clothes	28919.0254
as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brotherinlaw is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of and we cannot molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m	193.6071
yes and who is the man i do not know why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ballroom to find you oh said the countess to franz go with all speedpoor young man perhaps some accident has happened to him i will hasten replied franz	94.2948
general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s	166.5491
do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor no do you prefer i should seek m	150.2746
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor	179.4562
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers	570.9028
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest	223.9801
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed	117.4841
yet i let him die what do i say	31.2578
valentine we may easily conceive where morrels appointment was	513.9138
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another	130.2442
what is it asked villefort rushing from his room	115.3357
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	71.0821
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight and dartagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper	102.9625
take it quickly thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove off	93.7856
i will profit by the advice and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	249.7293
whats your business here you hussy dartagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak	226.6270
de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed imperceptibly	469.2490
the southern districts were illwatched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès	482.4622
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief	155.4592
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence	192.7447
that poor child said madame de villefort when valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness meanwhile valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edwards room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase	143.6084
ho ho what are the wishes of his eminence he wishes to have you in his service and who spoke to him of me rochefortyou remember him yes pardieu it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much you gave him three swordwounds in three separate engagements but you know he is now our friend no i didnt know that	127.5807
shall i tell you what you ought to do morcerf command me madame well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us what for asked eugénie	103.7849
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of dartagnan and of athos it must be the best but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison egad cried dartagnan hes just the man i count upon	96.7849
dartagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood	466.6290
i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here the cavalier addressed some words in english to his sister	158.0218
i dont care to be shot in a box no said aramis he has not seen us	67.8081
a dinner in the old style	3458.3972
does the house approve that the examination should take place today m yes was the unanimous answer	310.2083
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them	278.6214
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty what has become of him	198.4346
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentryboxes	382.2996
at the language you use what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling	89.1913
once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a halfruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me	273.6306
alas your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels what then amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv well in these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with the fattest among them cried dartagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing	247.3061
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead	97.8807
well well cried dartagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos yes said porthos but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep i think it is the wind now climb up athos quickly said dartagnan	120.9046
well said athos dont you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question	91.2359
oh you will not abandon me you will not leave me to perish you will not be pitiless cried mordaunt	53.5698
at last we are off exclaimed porthos	165.0776
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	219.6613
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs	85.3701
has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance to whom did he give up his sword he did not give it up he broke it he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage there was a momentary pause	102.0493
nay dear mother say the accused person	5184.9351
i also have made my preparations this morning oh heavens yes said aramis	144.3436
there was no time to lose	211.4684
albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the windowcurtains	2788.0425
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking	204.5467
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him i dont call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice	220.9827
four young men of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world	177.0873
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be usefulthat of the king exactly answered the musketeer	160.4331
oh yes with all my soul well then listen valentine said the count i have a favor to ask of you of me	54.6613
that instant the arm of porthos fell	318.5030
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the corso	53.3268
this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions	45.4201
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his lifethat of standing behind a gilded carriage	157.7730
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother	421.0129
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious you think the count will be angry with me think it	108.7666
he was still younghe was only four or fiveandtwentyhe had nearly fifty years to live	318.6479
sire said winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready the king looked at the three gentlemen	222.8584
i name only the most important you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these yes i speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greeki dont speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself improve yourself repeated dantès why how can you manage to do so why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium	170.9327
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers	580.1660
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired	180.3917
i resist my fathers order and my dying grandmothers wish	379.1484
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide willingly my lord	173.4764
then he will tell it me himself i doubt it my lord why do you doubt it because the secret does not belong to him because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen and he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united as if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast you pique my curiosity dear rochefort pray tell me the whole story that is impossible but i will tell you a true story my lord pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal	143.9089
then he saw beneath a thick clump of lindentrees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawingroom into the garden	231.8466
how dartagnan and porthos earned by selling straw	1819.7554
i think so indeed he has six millions worth he must sell them at whatever price why because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain m how do you know debray shrugged his shoulders	258.7926
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter	257.3705
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	37.9399
no fifteen thousand are not enoughi cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs no replied andrea dryly no i cannot i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly i said without your laying out a sou do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortuneand yours with mineand both of us to be dragged down there again it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	189.1259
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinals	366.0385
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before	95.9958
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied	121.5031
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you	108.7820
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared	230.2457
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself	87.2235
life is full of humiliations and sorrows continued he becoming still more melancholy all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man particularly the golden ties	199.9707
now if i die say to dartagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me	73.8061
m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down	144.5766
de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs	66.3099
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out	139.3139
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques	83.5997
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of sanfelice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded	226.7056
dart exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand	57.1999
but as you are the strongest after all continued dartagnan dont be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked dartagnan with an eloquent look	253.9560
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion	220.2599
when i awoke a fresh meal was served	840.6675
arrived at ryston dartagnan assembled his friends	27.5076
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me m well be it so	55.1926
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door	256.4085
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his arm	70.9174
news from your father do you hear henrietta	439.4997
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when dartagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand	151.5526
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god but let me see how was it done	150.5524
here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army how do you make that out inquired athos	68.1916
i have something to say to you certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck	172.8383
necessity has no law besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least	414.3136
now to see things which i cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life	300.4364
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children	142.2020
to troyes in champagne i answered	769.9974
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the customhouse officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire	147.9491
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you dartagnan became more and more astonished	203.4685

sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london	88.9670
it is not of my wife i hope on the contrary it is of her	46.4567
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted	197.5847
they advanced towards a boat which a customhouse officer held by a chain near the quay	275.9514
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal	247.2285
as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection	247.6419

they have vexed you and you are angry the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent	97.1788
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite ordination cried dartagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him	195.8325
covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help	212.0037
heres the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea and what on earth are you going to do with it asked athos	114.1666
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality	155.4929
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain	377.8673
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum	302.8613
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his goldmounted cane the papers that lay on the table	222.3401
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever	154.8999
cries of despair resounded on all sides	125.6277
morrel good worthy man said caderousse	54.7463
progress of cavalcanti the younger chapter	362.4315
yes had i died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny	129.9544
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoi give you back your promise it is well said dantès	165.3698
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly	192.4424
clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen	243.3342
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes	22.6789
feverish and excited i rang at the door	7.9885
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	136.9265
this time it was mordaunt who smiled	94.9868
gimblou a glass of wine well how has all gone off zounds you know theres only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party yes i know that he said but give me the particulars you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two	144.6579
edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber	57.0537
no but franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before him	91.9344
if you had seen at what a pace he camelike the wind i should think soa horse that cost francs said monte cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son	245.4893
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos	112.3861
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishmentall returned with a stunning force to his memory	341.5217
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano	288.1308
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by gods	227.0561
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out	105.4601
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens you shall have no weapon left in your power there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it	140.1995
faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman	135.2234
do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary	186.7474
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night there	198.8149
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them	179.3680
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him oh father i exclaimed you are very good but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me	135.2953
ah exclaimed davrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery	182.3090
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door	63.3462
can i trust in you oh madame cried the young woman falling on her knees upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking it	68.6575
follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps wait an instant said the host number has two staircasesinside and outside good said the brigadier	316.9960
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a daybut in seven	198.3571
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	80.7966
heres a sword and a dress said porthos	177.3282
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial and have you succeeded i think so madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room monte cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to consciousness	90.9042
my faith my good host said dartagnan filling the two glasses i asked for a bottle of your best wine and if you have deceived me you will be punished in what you have sinned for seeing that i hate drinking by myself you shall drink with me	92.6783
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces	2217.3206
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	128.6176
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet dartagnan	116.7358
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it	178.6096
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me i shall not be more than half an hour and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him	77.5944
where is athos in the cellar monsieur what you scoundrel have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven no monsieur we keep him in the cellar you do not know what he is about in the cellar	94.1150
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor acockbill the jibboom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the _pharaon_ towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot	241.4985
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and châteaurenaud	113.9070
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him	168.4836
is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement	139.2852
that is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the chief cucumetto cried luigi and teresa at the same moment	84.8857
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	91.4109
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening	242.7712
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness	284.8820
the conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus	378.2064
this gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use the cardinal referred to that man whom dartagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel	192.5502
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	542.5004
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of or livres	103.5618
but allow me to say that you must have been very young theni was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memoryin what manner could these events concern you	298.2695
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and youyou would pass rather a sad quarterhour with the red duke replied aramis	295.7838
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you	142.3144
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild	249.1717
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position	147.3491
order it as you please sire you possess the right of pardon the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is innocent	148.9884
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships	110.2734
when i am dead you will go and examine it what said morrel you dead yes must i not be prepared for everything dear friend	121.4297
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	91.1450
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears	224.6728
the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers	124.2326
caderousses knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue	216.5721
danglars in promoting a new railway line you m	516.6915
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat but you can sleep when you please monsieur said morrel	157.0382
i am a man of order sir let us do things in order nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you i command here ah sir said dartagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us	85.6921
i certainly never will get drunk again dartagnan it is too bad a habit dartagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me is it to your mind asked dartagnan	113.1449
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel m	165.6407
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke dangouleme were called the petitsmaitres	228.8149
are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage what a confounded long time this first act lasts	278.3880
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry	85.0385
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs	154.4437
in my house murmured he in my house come magistrate said m	346.6902
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill	214.2633
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over	77.2138
well asked madame danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood	179.7463
we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m	89.4327
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic firtrees and myrtles	243.0393
i live as it were between two graves	1886.2194
is it you said he i am here is your jailer gone yes said dantès he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us i can work then said the voice	91.0966
the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at rouen after which if nothing new occurs i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisylesec and i said athos am returning to bragelonne	193.8093
this is the case said dartagnan this is your brother madeleine you dont know him perhaps but i know him he has arrived from amsterdam	127.8234
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	205.0803
at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them	108.4569
but come i am waiting for you both men entered monte cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no	84.2094
he clung to one ideathat of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheardof fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante	638.7738
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting	138.5011
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my fathers revenue i said danglars have always intended giving my daughter francs as her dowry she is besides my sole heiress all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing	195.1858
de monte cristo is our enemy replied mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered her	221.5635
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog i like the means well enough said dartagnan but where and how to meet with her time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man	126.3295
on the sixth day the smugglers returned	1237.6383
it followed that dartagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsathos porthos and aramis	157.9305
at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request	186.5615
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	179.9289
in fact her position was terrible	2323.8994
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure three curates remainedthose of st merri st sulpice and st eustache	443.2690
have you not let it go out of your hands no davrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them	121.2117
i am no relation of yours you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man	52.3978
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm	211.3887
it is the first time he has ever been in paris	38.2907
if you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the other	49.1572
this is fine said porthos to himself i am prettily caught he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme	261.4280
you do not understand me gentlemen said dartagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun	90.0102
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir	34.5436
reflect then wretched man and repent no said caderousse no i will not repent	125.6450
she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saintméran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a soninlaws respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée	285.1748
laugh then said monsieur de retz they are looking at us and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group	71.8847
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	159.1993
at this instant they heard the sound of horses feet	67.6215
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied	153.6235
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	300.7884
the sellers of _moccoletti_ entered on the scene	50.8566
stop let me show you the way it is not worthwhile yes it is why because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichets locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist thank you said andrea i will let you know a week beforehand they parted	227.6812
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	653.5609
i am lord de winter brotherinlaw of that _woman_ the three friends uttered a cry of surprise	157.4566
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	196.9434
daiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women	697.6826
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	139.9695
begone then to your beautiful duchess i will detain you no longer and she is not to be despised in my opinion now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last do you love me still ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a campaigna campaign in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh dont talk of such things cried the procurators wife bursting into tears	99.9763
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay	139.1638
as dartagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse	144.4546
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air	113.3347
during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the windingsheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life	191.2743
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed	137.0571
the soldier went out leaving the dinner served	226.1298
talk only by gestures or rather always listen yes monsieur replied raoul	180.4217
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine no and yet you say he has sent you some as from us here is his letter said dartagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	124.3761
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him	221.5249
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred	220.5956
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic and what do you know of him nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse what makes you think so on the twentyeighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday i said this mass again and his name maillard but i do not think it is his right one and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post certainly let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are rightit will be you who have discovered the true treasure gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate	131.9207

_imponite manus_ and not _manum_place the _hands_ not the _hand_ place the _hands_ repeated the curate with a gesture	259.4995

in truth that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man dartagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at halfpast nine oclock he entered the anteroom	86.9327
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor	118.8505
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that _ventrebleu_ cried dartagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one	128.4285
this cant last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	131.2922
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him	189.1226
one step farther into resttwo perhaps into silence	879.5097
signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted	129.7385

besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so so much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	127.4166
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted	103.8135
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	150.3307

ah if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said dartagnan	98.5934

my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose	154.8450
de tréville in the same tone that a party of _procureurs_ commissaries and men of the policevery estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniformhave taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort levêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos athos said the king mechanically yes certainly i know that name let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously	204.9211

the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away	147.6137
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised dartagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	156.3011
de villefort yes sire and he comes from marseilles in person why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	144.1838

noirtier he then returned to his place but did not sit down	50.7558
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	185.6335

the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women	149.0920

i am betrayed on all sides	252.1074
instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to st germain my dear fellow said athos i ride horses when i have any when i have none i go afoot well said dartagnan smiling at the misanthropy of athos which from any other person would have offended him i ride what i can get i am not so proud as you	104.7387

as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	209.6519
well then we will go into paris	88.2298
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	263.9611

your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur dartagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy	144.1162

felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair	60.4575
well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no m	172.5722
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countesss visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme m and you will probably find your theme illchosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	195.5846
dartagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding milady	199.3474

as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	40.2982
monsieur dartagnan he cried falling back a step it is monsieur dartagnan let him pass dartagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard	101.0948
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest	161.9992
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès who talks of killing dantès	139.9158

no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his pockets	92.4987
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him oh count said de winter for whom do you take me for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way de winter shook him by the hand	74.6012

i will sit facing stuart whom i like so much to see especially where he now is and you monsieur dartagnan opposite to me athos turned red with rage	167.2690
but tell me what do you ask nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something the procurators wife hung upon the arm of porthos and in the violence of her grief she cried out monsieur porthos i am ignorant of all such matters how should i know what a horse is	75.1159
as this was the height of dartagnans worldly ambitionapart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme	385.0092
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing	168.8597

mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before	104.8435
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis dartagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m	165.5111

in the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless peoples minds were uneasy	2841.1992

de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made the counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater	194.3409

the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressingroom	123.2615

and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him	186.0565
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat	165.7968
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	220.3185
ah hurrah theres the sun a merry morning to you sunshine	455.5905
dartagnan followed the _soubrette_ with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where dartagnan had disappeared	118.0962
providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious	239.7044
read and answer or i will blow out your brains the sergeant saw that dartagnan was in earnest	138.8805
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the peoples goodwill	322.8067
can all this force be summoned on my account thought he	152.2646
he opened a window and leaned out to listen	166.5584
much money to be gained said bonacieux protruding his lip	1173.8387
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside	136.2029
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her	134.1185
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said dartagnan	112.8135
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help	156.7762
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friendyou can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction	138.9457
captivity the third day chapter lv	1143.7019
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti	463.8708
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady	41.2993
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs	95.1550
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	209.0961
well he said to the lieutenant	1737.6219
a gentleman and a diplomatist then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist	104.4610
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me how did the viscount albert fall into luigis hands excellency the frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa the chiefs mistress yes	425.4487
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to _écarté_it is not only a game it is a _horsdœuvre_ m	429.5319
felton was a puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet	116.6278
according to the laws of dueling at that period dartagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased	153.6645
i dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a scheme	315.0892
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal	70.7011
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat	84.3116
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered	209.7425
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their fathers arms	83.1165
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos	253.8345
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing	227.9972
oh youve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven i will not miss you if i give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword	63.4362
then i must wait asked the young man	4.4756
he saw dartagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	39.0107
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer	200.3117
sacrebleu dartagnan said porthos i must out with it at once for i cant keep to myself anything i have against you i havent been able to recognize you in this matter why not said dartagnan with his wise smile	92.4058
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safeconduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feareddartagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreusehe may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away the devil whats to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you cannot take me with you no the order is imperative	130.6291
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart _ennui_ can find no place you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace	512.4379
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart	83.9188
who are you asked the man	50.4109
let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit monsieur dartagnan will enjoy our conversation better yes replied dartagnan i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon dartagnan a look full of gratitude	190.4663
you shall soon have something to drink i give you my word if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of athos	123.2002
these proceedings made dartagnan and porthos draw back	475.4797
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him	356.0722
what could they desire beyond their liberty	339.4219
there and elsewhere the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	131.1181
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us no _pardieu_ though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse	157.7809
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces	333.6936
this look of porthoss made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning	160.1074
yes said the king but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men sire i am here said dartagnan and i give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it and now what is to be done asked the queen for i hear them monsieur laporte go to them and again recommend silence	75.8410
athos has been arrested yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen the arms of dartagnan fell powerless by his side	64.3905
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you	59.2098
de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which dartagnan had left him a little cavalier	74.3692
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once at the court which raoul had never seen his follies as page two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutors vigilancethese things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul	156.4932
i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error	64.8436
as dartagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m	110.7634
but once started he could not stop	36.6106
why did you not say all this before you took action sir she said	297.4900
let us know when breakfast is ready	257.8634
the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself	133.1804
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves	111.4487
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded	386.6158
andrea cavalcanti has become one of the family you can ask him that question the carriage stopped	58.5040
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror	173.4646
eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away	142.8178
de monte cristo receives my apology	7810.4194
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	531.3461
you are only responsible for my body is it not so	66.4726
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp	262.2295
the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count i accept the count returned to young morcerf	123.3304
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m	196.2128
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide	117.6546
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion	134.2319
it is nearly eight oclock and at nine i expect a visit	139.3660
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe	235.0580
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor womans head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees	131.1460
the countess de winter as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from dartagnan not all that had happened but what dartagnan himself knew	138.7453
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl	264.5129
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch	193.7230
you cannot think of going out in such weather as this oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller	121.3692
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman	450.8136
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away	229.3464
the duc delbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twentyfive thousand for each of the three others	128.8705
has mankind treated me as a brother	142.7898
still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired	161.9634
but continued morcerf _à propos_ of danglarswe have strangely wandered from the subject	950.7704
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk besides should any illluck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended	169.7116
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m	166.7607
let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings horse	96.3690
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays	510.3260
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	115.3799
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	73.6378
you too have been in england sir he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order	73.0506
on whom do my hopes rest	1212.7375
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then	187.7506
she will save us said conti	6693651.0000
i staked on him but there were three races were there not yes there was the prize given by the jockey cluba gold cup you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that race what was it oh shut up again interposed some of the audience	352.4354
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur labbé is repeating to me said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse	166.5106
bertuccio said the count unless i am mistaken it has been already written excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient go on i will keep my word one day we received a letter	97.9674
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the kings presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him	131.8387
do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse	96.8499
albert that and he may know what to answer you oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right	68.9312
if i may ask without indiscretion near here replied de comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are he is wandering about the environs of the castle thought dartagnan	169.4318
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	139.2941
that is not probable it is possible said milady	27.4304
ah said milady listening in her turn to the noise of feltons steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter at length you are mine then her brow darkened	116.1205
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of dartagnan	75.2296
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	260.8987
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee	154.6537
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receivergeneral	312.3902
but his temper cooled down like his friends he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos	139.1034
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there	174.3121
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i	133.7821
how so returned the count with surprise	160.9551
that will insure his confidence athos smiled	298.3482
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance	186.9174
then he thought he was going to die	27.5034
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread what do you say to this du vallon i said porthos i am entirely of dartagnans opinion this is a beastly country this england you are quite decided then to leave it asked athos of dartagnan	146.4267
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news alas sire answered athos your majesty has guessed aright it is bad news yes sire never mind the messenger is welcome	145.2997
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions	228.1600
at that moment he cut it	47.8498
what was all that to scarron	4751.3706
i have a post by which i live at the death of monsieur de tréville who is old i may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless gascon	146.0346
at last one day emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the accounts	61.3918
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee	78.7527
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	469.0287
the party was to take place at st germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmesdeschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah you incline me to think so said the king	177.1145
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping	2847.5930
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	75.1007
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	183.2522
it was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been gained but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him	317.6329
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy	8933.0508
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his supper	123.9867
never never i believe you said mme	114.2394
what shall we do said athos	21.0625
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured	305.6255
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away	261.0416
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly	771.5502
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse	324.4866
if you heard the cry of mad dog you would take your gunyou would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog	399.8909
please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account	130.3917

well said the count what are you doing you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do what may that be we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them do not concern yourself about that we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there after the execution cried franz	105.3155
a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriagedrive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers	261.7629
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you why i think there were not many intruders	168.9235
as certainly maximilian as i now press your hand i shall kill him before ten oclock tomorrow morning morrel in his turn took monte cristos hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was	114.3456
danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes yes said monte cristo i think m	166.3184
if only we two arrive said dartagnan it will be enough since the dukes troop are only four in number that is true said porthos and he spurred his courser on	110.6670
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity and what do you mean to do to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours and what is your excellencys project just this	167.7942
de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news	178.0630
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy	1023.5924
it must have been charming indeed	350.6941
i shall kill himi cannot help it	122.8883
alas i do replied athos with a deep sigh	63.4844
my faith i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about	322.6690
there is a carriage coming said châteaurenaud	120.9813
zounds lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed felton blushed	295.2867
a letter said the young man	1.7678
keep your moneykeep it i sayone never has too muchbut at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it it was offered with good will said dantès	160.8691
the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queens consent to it i can answer only for myself said mazarin	98.4045
do as you like she said i rely upon you will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command sir what do the people want this time demanded the king	152.1965
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys	29.2491
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him	310.7216
ah you resist do you cried jussac	770.4131
dantès was beside himself with joy	116.2759
a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated	115.2776
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground	138.4153
i am not a banker like m	298.8177
am iam i then to sleep on the floor asked gaston dorleans with a forced smile	509.9808
yes indeed the marks are recent quite so replied the lieutenant	318.5148
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan	242.1226
now sir i am listeninggo on i will come at once to the point	47.1412
this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple and at the third she expired at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my opinion yes before others replied the doctor but now we are alone what are you going to say	143.0262
de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it	112.8852
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her	379.4251
in after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band	117.7546
but it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers	251.6061
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo	243.0648
villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m	84.8897
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard	153.7806
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	97.3100
m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon but you have seen him sire i went straight to the duc de blacas but you will see him then i think not sire ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive i forgot you and m	73.3380
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood	207.6134
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said hegood good you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of sanfelices daughter	173.1282
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it you dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse	293.6324
you might have taken lord winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking them mordaunts very lips grew white with rage	446.0482
ah confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	245.9870
i saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then i heard the wellknown creaking of the door although i had heard that door open but twice	108.5681
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you	72.1269
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	202.7880
leave the room and send me a woman women are very indiscreet my sister	179.2706

noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	1603.2581
de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure	92.2193
the blood had mounted to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis	66.3628
at neufchâtel as at st valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him	161.8788
no well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful	173.6886
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet	112.2817
franz looked upthey were opposite the rospoli palace	243.1056
yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her and what said the abbé asked athos	106.5577
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privationhe was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness	227.7562
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semicircle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity	226.9963

but how do you procure a light oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of farias mind	158.1173
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance	179.1457
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and cannot now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating	187.0807
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer	146.3860
but make hastei cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	325.4962

he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winters head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast	189.4545
suddenly dartagnan touched something warm which moved	241.1152
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man	70.5570
de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	303.0482
see what is going on monsieur dartagnan said he	32.1708
good you may be easy thenyoull get there dartagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters	286.1470
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	209.7306
if he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel	358.4724
guiche knew everybodymadame de neuillan mademoiselle daubigne mademoiselle de scudery mademoiselle paulet madame de chevreuse	287.1816

it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle that is to say at the other end of france	63.0658
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	233.8117
i am as poor as job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i dont believe you would find a hundred pistoles peste a hundred pistoles said dartagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as job if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus then aloud are you ambitious as enceladus well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish the shadow of a cloud passed over aramiss face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape dartagnans observation	161.1979
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers dartagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side	182.1874

ah my poor friends murmured dartagnan where are you	16.9301
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf	158.7840
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy	107.3814
cant you guess my dear athos	50.2901
but pardon me are you free	540.0575

remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service the young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated monsieur dartagnan that is it my son the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed it	78.8726
the surgeon declared that the situation of the musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood	141.6275
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death	246.9328
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hidingplace three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus	506.6790
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château dif and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects	235.6828
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which dartagnan is blindly governed	529.2480
noirtier seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the th of february and on the rd of march you turn up here in paris and if i have come my dear father said gérard drawing closer to m	112.8403

bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed	319.8243
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence	190.6922
_holà_ bazin bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked dartagnan	101.5880
ah if i knew sblood messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you i am sure of itthey would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step	214.2448
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them	137.9385
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board	52.7700
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject	318.1165

so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned unquestionably so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time precisely m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman	147.1140

for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments	105.5748

four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was waiting and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive tranquil yes replied cromwell	178.6653
the house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea	170.3779
alas do you love nothing else in me asked dartagnan	82.3204
well said he in a low voice	38.9392
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds	124.1504
dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was guarded	131.7653
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn i did not perceive that there were three of us then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is fernandthe man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world	105.8316

de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously m	71.2602
the king went straight to him	27.8056
you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances dartagnan bowed with respect	70.3114
the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchids troops that is to say with our enemies	189.0628
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help what is the matter with your highness asked la ramee	108.6172
that however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as i am to that of your majesty i ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you the cardinal smiled	69.5912
the next morning dartagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer	306.3137
bonacieux dartagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an armchair	227.5685
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words	407.6375
the conversation took place in englisha language which dartagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage	215.5184
oh you are an angel exclaimed the young man	18.3148
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps	214.0591
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace	145.3619
in the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded	159.2109
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain	440.9355
de villefort said the king come in villefort bowed and advancing a few steps waited until the king should interrogate him	137.9142
we dont know the locality and shall never find the wall	91.4930
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart	246.1248
de monte cristo the count bowed	305.6755

the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	226.3229
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	307.7554
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m	231.8946
give him a lesson debray stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived what is it it is she whom do you mean they said she had left mademoiselle eugénie said châteaurenaud has she returned no but her mother madame danglars	106.1417
a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea	144.3058
what do you want monsieur demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to dartagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures	114.4558
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham	48.7876
his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency	485.2377
violence he said to himself would spoil all dartagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt	179.8935
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms	140.3121
de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment	470.8994
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his doublet	229.0168
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl	262.4229

stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden	66.4000
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital	216.6066
who are you and what do you want cried she	32.8581
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	297.6125
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count	154.9263
what the devil could that handkerchief signify placed where he was dartagnan could not perceive the face of aramis	180.2776
the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegardea little nearer to the former than to the lattera small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard	279.4839
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room	43.1978
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m	115.0984

de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio	88.5020
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation	280.0113
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this morning chapter xvi	175.6559
de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinals guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making _sortie_ against the kings musketeers	187.0819
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say	179.0280
i have now to confess to you	7.8369
i thank you for having recognized me sir debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor	176.4454
dartagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	145.8778
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities	253.3156

what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism	183.2612
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man	227.4726
go sir go but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it	91.4804
you chevalier dherblay to his left	675.7943
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men and i may profit by monsieurs happiness and go to bed yes go may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of dartagnan had not entirely effaced	112.2152
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur créquy another time at my own house in the country in my château atwhen i had a château a third time at monsieur de trévilles where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman	173.9996
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	234.4432
you dont like playing then on the contrary i do lansquenet for instance devoted to it	227.4564
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming	242.7243
franz questioned albert as to his intentions but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor	199.7638
dartagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	109.1227
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness	192.2542
coquenard did not seem to observe it	114.1657
raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out the spaniards the spaniards that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation	254.7148
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle	449.3634
he resembles his mother so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in	32.9160
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton	193.1816
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained	152.0255
had dartagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character	112.1993
then those who dwelt in bonacieuxs unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture	1074.7770
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful	449.4635
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him	133.7420
de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said	99.6925
my good my brave guitant whatsoever command i may give you in that languagein frenchwhatever i may order you to do will you not perform it certainly	295.2704
about five oclock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting	136.1503
de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your careyes sir replied morcerf but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me	172.7104

i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud	413.2058
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused	177.4534
dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend	73.4801
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand	152.5806
is there anything new in the wind nothing i thought perhaps that the kings death has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here what have you come for then to embark with you ah ah the general doubted my fidelity no but i wish to have a share in my revenge	136.8384
i am king of all creation	8625.1699
it was dark and silent as the tomb	135.5634
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste	212.2324
come along athos come along cried dartagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his	289.4307
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wifes writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my sons sake i became criminal	158.1249
hush whispered de guiche these are cavaliers yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted can you see what they are doing yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche	178.6833
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on dutya zealous catholic no doubtshook off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame your song is as dismal as a de profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton	387.4337
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me	66.8113
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take	96.2655
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me m mercédès burst into tears her womans heart was breaking under its load of memories	225.7542
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized	383.1881
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better	103.4746
you see its evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not	122.4884
he was carried home in the arms of the people	23.9827
you shall take him with you there	75.6295
he knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments but whence did these impediments arise	318.6288
dartagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants offices	327.5685
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk	141.2797
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo	184.9853
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still	281.2110
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair	40.1992
she raised her head with an effort	102.0589

your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand go on then replied the count	73.2253
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death	355.5776
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith	91.1730

little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark	194.0979
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows	169.4819

do you wish for a notary asked villefort	174.5266
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	206.7395
madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other	95.7265
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrens children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to youfor had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself orno my poor mother i could not have killed her by the same blowi should have fled from my country dear albert said beauchamp	186.9146

i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the count	184.1173
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank	111.5798
teresa had a great desire to see this ball	55.8485

and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it fernand became deadly pale	188.3025
come fernand wont you return to marseilles with us no said fernand i shall return to the catalans youre wrong	107.3847

demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm	718.9653
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases	176.3244

tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition your arms my lordwhat arms zounds my weapons what weapons my military weapons yes my lord at any rate i think so make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	326.2593
de tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queens eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful	108.0953
to meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easychair	259.1191
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to youmisfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for youi would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score	185.9581

and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter i give you my word of honor sir said dantès but what is the matter	34.1363
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him	62.4207
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us	337.5852
if that is the case i warn you i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum alas excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the counts laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience	144.2303
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary siron the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled	141.1838
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it	109.7330
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration_utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_ dartagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m	487.9150
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twentyfive years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic	124.5012
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly	42.9448
monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it	137.0983
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried milady and a threatening glance darted from her eyes	128.2161
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering	56.3068
well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in gods sight	230.2018
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	386.9666
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything	131.2725
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	80.6718
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name	96.6702
no said she withdrawing it gentlyno my friend touch me not	779.4815
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	357.5461
you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions	2270.8091
not at all my young man	8.6192
if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	91.7164
ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made	59.4652
you are a simpleton said athos	16.4121
who wants me a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal and who wishes to speak with me who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne then let him come in if you please oh my god my god cried mme	69.6017
be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven oclock in the evening on the road to chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant no signature	101.9097
speak sir i beg you to do so i beg you to excuse me madame i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen	115.4494
she is what the english call a yacht where was she built i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor	179.2959
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late	100.8007
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him	134.8297
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under arms	1051.6976
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth	218.6264
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m	120.1296
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere very good thought dartagnan tis our road likewise we will go together all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones	158.1970
let us try not to jest if we can	148.8133
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de châteaurenaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saintméran despised all who were not noble	212.1325
no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowlingpiece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude	296.2056
come come said porthos jump in but monsieur said mousqueton i cant swim let me stay here and me too monsieur said blaisois	146.6461
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late madame the orders are issued well should he be arresteddo they think they will arrest him i hope so if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head	155.9367
i was there at a fearful moment	545.5878
it was thus worded my dear fellow the moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocketbook which you will find in the square drawer of the _secrétaire_ add your own to it if it be not sufficient	89.4839
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	86.2981
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristos door	62.4333
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	43.3363
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m	27.3510
a circle was immediately formed around the door	53.3014
davrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat	94.8557
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly	176.9260
this treasure exists dantès and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will	39.9305
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly	104.2516
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel	310.2844
there had been no stipulation in her favor	145.6997
you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation	90.2297
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit	190.6192
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest	195.7949
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	24.4594
morcerf and châteaurenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission	164.9958
an instant after porthos and aramis reentered the surgeon and m	120.4446
i am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked italian accent	63.7660
you were right sir said anne	212.6704
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered	281.4803
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness	41103.7891
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him	75.9847
bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis	193.7164
de winter remembered the monster that milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man	133.2364
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny	162.8080
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france take care athos cried dartagnan dont you see they are aiming yes yes said athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him	136.2984
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed	74.6137
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthoss horse and that of dartagnan	253.6914
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything degenerates i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis	280.4245
his heart beat but not like dartagnans with a young and impatient love	451.8772
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieus creature my lord	380.4344
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their genealogy their alliances their coats of arms and the origin of them	283.9937
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you but from whom is that letter oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding _grisette_ from madame de chevreuses chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchesss coronet what do you say hold i must have lost it said the young man maliciously pretending to search for it	200.3544
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees	97.5007
i thought i did not mistake	845.4727
dont let us disarrange your eminence	62.8465
yes said morrel it is true i have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you are you then come from m	121.7763
try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption	897.4922
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to dartagnans deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville	94.6620
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools	764.1874
but all my fortune is in england	130.1787
he must have written to him	21.9007
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws	308.5953
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	82.9786
they threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house	190.2725
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	205.7302
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions	306.8587
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the postingmaster	149.7487
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens	138.3812
it was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	82.4752
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death put him to death franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	141.5104
morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us no no said m	80.1214
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port	83.4393
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber	79.0302
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price his excellency is not perhaps aware that m	97.6229
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos	73.2768
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of age	1022.4080
porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration	149.1091
ah this is something new replied the king	23.4798
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it	89.9656
taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation without bowing at the feet of satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth	152.2693
monseigneur will be with him in an hour good said friquet my fortune is made by the way said bazin where was he carried to the tower saint jacques la boucherie and delighted with the success of his embassy friquet started off at the top of his speed	121.7395
my dear bazin said dartagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger	137.8172
well said he on perceiving aramis	294.2032
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	232.6968
you excel us all athos smiled with ineffable pleasure	350.2185
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him	198.4073
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night	116.9474
but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	312.0429
it was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died and what did you do then what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	54.8314
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against the wall this was all the furniture	864.3124
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no champsélysées	113.3974
toward paris who stopped him two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mentionthe viscount de bragelonne and it was this young man who brought the monk to you	69.6739
de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree	171.0976
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding	301.9949
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentines room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a bloodred color	200.3325
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery	295.9109
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion	218.8221
his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure	105.6739
at the sight of papers of all sortstitles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i foundnothing	500.8335
the footmans mission was an easy one	442.4108
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box	99.6014
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy ah said mazarin breathing more freely	128.8841
i will not die alonei will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands	265.3289
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m	109.3323
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word	67.7945
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m	106.5013
by your poems no i have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram i compose sermons my friend what sermons	1096.5422
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	61.5626
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	414.0616
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercédès and his father could have joined him	187.0806
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct	544.3851
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive dantès you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion these words rang in dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength	133.1643
all this negotiation must be carried on openly i will follow your eminences instructions to the letter	166.6451
he will be furious but i dont care	217.6038
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary dartagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach	268.5150
but whom are you seeking debray i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man	24.7923
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back	243.5126
mademoiselle de villefort my stepdaughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand	78.4313
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself ah ah said porthos that is what you meant to say yes dear monsieur porthos	144.7178
oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man	149.0740
take care i repeat to you take care	77.9155
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	230.6595
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods	297.6518
i am captain dantès a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going on my honor i have no idea have you no idea whatever none at all that is impossible i swear to you it is true	93.7047
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking dartagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him	83.8139
ah said porthos let us hear what he says dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows dear dartagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me	95.5779
albert rose to return to his place	54.4299
she would not be weary thank god for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful vengeance	561.4451
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something	81.9937
yes that first and other things afterward speak it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you me yes you	109.9979
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the kings musketeers in these quarrels	207.3966
m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention	178.0555

is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips	90.0946
but as we have said dartagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty	188.2402
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st paul or of the place de grêve it was at the traitors cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him	166.3308
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé farias pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading _le drapeau blanc_	362.4682
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with	78.6477
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty	189.7319
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shoppeople and the bands of mendicants reappeared	311.5912
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him pardon me said he but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal	126.9367
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of ityouyes ifaith youre rightthose delicate yet firmset lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart yes it is one of miladys bastards you laugh aramis from habit that is all	321.3540
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word	147.4362
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning	890.2947
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me	196.0720
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired	126.3727
i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her capital but how will you get me out of paris oh as to that you must leave it to me i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like dartagnan shook his head	102.6311
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and dartagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m	144.5742
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use i would make of it oh hear me to the end that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercys for pitys sake i will embrace your knees you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you my god to youthe only just good and compassionate being i have met with to youmy preserver perhaps one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door	161.6632
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage	231.6728
have the goodness to send mine to athoss residence	534.9448
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	152.4124
what jealousy to tear such clothes he looks like a bigbug said another dresses in fine style	985.3992
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death be easy said dartagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead	135.1469
i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours	61.4076
ah if im not mistaken heres bazin	107364.8594
it is six oclock said madame de villefort evidently agitated	79.7519
move monsieurmove away i entreat you you are exactly in the spot what spot where he fell m my dear monsieur bertuccio said monte cristo laughing control yourself we are not at sartène or at corte	155.4964
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin i hope so and when will the dance begin the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow morning you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier dhumieres has promised me whenever i need them upon fifty soldiers yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them good my dear rochefort but that is not all	173.1119
i my lordwho told you that nobody but i know it i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria	84.5234
the brand of englandit would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of franceoh by that by _that_ i was branded indeed this was too much for felton	156.1409
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	885.7833
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend	68.1483
m so sir you lived at lucca did you	269.6354
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	39.7748
do you think it is worth while said villefort	174.9487
you shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or i will throw it into the seine and i doubt as was the case with polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us well i will take it then said dartagnan	112.5974
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them	288.4376
it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	480.6445
do you know that i die tomorrow at ten oclock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment	120.8522
one day however an emissary of the cardinals gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often	55.7170
aramis started back and drew his	5.1787
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture	175.5297
i have the honor to be with respect etc marechal de grammont at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i	127.1648
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	208.6444
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill dartagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of dartagnan or rather of planchet after dartagnan had saved his life	131.4842
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do	80.1264
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject	154.6981
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	180.2606
ah is it you baron said he	9.6719
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain	177.5123
is it possible that thomson french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers	271.3315
and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my honor	238.8571
three days afterward pistache was found deadpoisoned	80630.9609
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen	696.2253
noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all	173.9500
and when did you arrive here inquired she	183.6574
then dartagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend	128.8634
with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way by all means replied monte cristo i follow you chapter	80.0928
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	117.8001
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious	257.3878
nevertheless at eight oclock in the morning the regiment of the queens guards commanded by guitant under whom was his nephew comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms	390.9612
edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard he pushed back his bed and waited for day	114.4489
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life	278.5482
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i havent seen what does not concern me but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers and he added turning to porthos heres a gentleman whos of the same opinion as myself porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	162.3763
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys	73.4696
but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twentytwo years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my fathersit was herrera	376.4051
this is a boy tréville a mere boy do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux truly without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty why he is a very devil this béarnais _ventresaintgris_ monsieur de tréville as the king my father would have said	153.6396
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by dartagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villarscotterets	128.7898
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valetdechambre called out make ready at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out la bruyere and du barthois march it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked dartagnan	172.9500
the hôtel then is far away at the other end of the town very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage	67.2704
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity	601.5972
fernand dashed his on the ground	88.6815
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it	172.0177
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	142.2821
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord dartagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside	75.1623
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room	104.6460
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his friends	128.9581
friend dartagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future	139.1764
dartagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance	93.4646
have you not happy rogue that you arehave you not your duchess who cannot fail to come to your aid well you see my dear dartagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world	121.3041
the words that parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive	147.1973
for pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble	554.6884
how do you feel barrois asked he	56.9214
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	84.8299
m oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret	344.2661
lead me to him jacopo pointed towards the horizon	161.0855
where you please my dear child come then and kitty who had not let go the hand of dartagnan led him up a little dark winding staircase and after ascending about fifteen steps opened a door	154.9886
you foolish fellow said athos laughing	119.8140
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened	108.1590
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy father and mercédès come said the abbé closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtierhis arrival at marseilles and interview with his fatherhis affection for mercédès and their nuptual feasthis arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château dif from this point everything was a blank to dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	193.9064
however amidst all the prisoners efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent	505.8396
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man	116.5354
m dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	219.0704
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawingrooms come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying	169.7388
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me	38.2257
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen	279.5346
the door had been opened and shut again the mercers pretty wife had disappeared	240.8059
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier	159.4041
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future	223.3711
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	310.2416
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conqueror	152.5352
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting	527.8113
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	46.6045
you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door go sir said the queen i will follow you dartagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box	52.9636
yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings milady sprang out of bed	174.6060
spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste	413.4666
the noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern	228.9334
it was then richelieus object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom	131.0631
he will not go today said dartagnan but here ill pay you for us two in that case let us go said the shipmaster	145.3618
here i am wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us why all these precautions you shall know milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	107.6242
de monte cristo has only shown us kindness	1718.8184
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made	227.0130
now i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly	391.5991
an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons he had an only daughter who married m	268.2610
bonacieux having always lived among her husbands friendspeople little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her positionmme	450.8334
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and mannersa freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	283.4695
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open	161.3882
to save yourselves to scamper away to fleethat is good for the kings musketeers porthos and aramis trembled with rage	145.3910
the treasure of the spadas exists	7475.7041
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob	775.6033
there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off	340.0650
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion	1405.1470
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty here it is replied aramis	144.8697
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once	191.9166
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	149.7835
sir said he up to this timeand it is now more than fourandtwenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for fiveandthirty yearsnever has anything bearing the signature of morrel son been dishonored i know that replied the englishman	231.2873
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly	173.9539
but by degrees watchchains necklaces particolored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded	584.9767
noirtier asked morrel while davrigny looked inquiringly	597.8983
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	257.4206
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me m right dantès quite right	88.7715
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen	254.2757
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend the fair indian approached scarron	199.9301
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier	93.1159
the anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	533.3661
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	310.4075
dartagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen	302.2535
i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived	67.4066
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him	167.9110
however in an hour i shall know all	49.5398
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience	164.5552
the fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos	219.8370
but thats more than dislike thats ingratitude come come calm yourself my sweet girl i thought you had softened	925.9909
there was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	343.0741
fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend caderousse there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only oneandtwenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it	188.0909
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september	176.1718
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said _saccommodi_ the italian _saccommodi_ is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molières that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance	179.2351
why what ails you asked he of edmond	193.0265
it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant	455.5903
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf	134.1690
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger	174.2090
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music	528.1046
six days ago i landed at portsmouth well said felton	92.1908
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded	95.1275
he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second	108.8766
at this time athos came up to dartagnan	26.2683
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	33.6812
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement	108.0407
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven oclock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and dont you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the _barberi_ who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell	108.2680
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit	324.8777
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss but yet detail them to me why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one	310.0163
mercédès i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen yearsfourteen years i wept i cursed now i tell you mercédès i must revenge myself the count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred	219.4387
for the moment she wished nothing better	714.3994
_hola_ lubin my pistols planchet called out dartagnan take care of the lackey i will manage the master planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon lubin and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his breast	150.9553
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsmercédès had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude	425.1158
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step	88.3094
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonadesellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it	144.0672
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here asked planchet	57.3920
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them	504.6639
stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night	113.0039
as to the lefthand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior	252.5704
oh said athos to himself is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that i see what i see	67.8581
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i dont doubt	132.2542
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust	510.4844
noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m	255.7027
whether noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him	235.3809
dartagnan will give each of us his instructions	260.6560
and signed by whomby the king and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt	54.8867
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre but jest as he might he gained nothing	194.3357
so you defend him and i who have sworn to take him dead or alive i am dishonoredand by you kill me replied athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant theres only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my way	202.5797

during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly	147.2520
a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	48.0475

i hold this serpent in my hands	50.9414
i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an exile i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to dartagnan	177.0676
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal	77.3029

m where is morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is we have already asked that question said châteaurenaud for none of us has seen him the count was silent but continued to gaze around him	126.4904
oh how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	179.4424
do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper	233.7091
dartagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively	193.8913
very well my lord it shall be so dartagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarins flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness	249.2716
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance	143.6422

she was branded athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand	58.1214
instinctively fernand drew back his chair	235.9784
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you	153.7559
the papers said something about it did they not then you believe the papers inot the least in the world only i fancied that the honest _messager_ was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches well thats what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly francs this month not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss _diable_ said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate fortune thirdrate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate fortunes	256.5503

i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp	88.2708
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory	240.2104
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels	700.4577
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows	788.4227
she will soon pass she is already late	271.1505
you understand athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m	113.9898
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet	163.7970
and with my grandfathers consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrels intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them	112.2212
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed	144.8121
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannonshot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls	259.7517
and to sign the contract in three days yes then in my turn i also say very well danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	99.6882
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	66.5593
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	68.2423
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal well you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you i have my _full power_ show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name very well dont forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess to what purpose i am a victim of the cardinal	108.0509
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumesgigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from mens shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callots temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends	635.9859
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm	542.7022
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse	229.8756
on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers	320.1586
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these _tavolettas_ nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february rd being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band	177.8809
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison	193.8042
do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand	108.7674

moral wounds have this peculiaritythey may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart	421.7132
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	124.5438
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	37.2362
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends	217.5319
no the sacrifice returned châteaurenaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us the history to which m	207.2519
everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts	96.0967
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault	221.7996

oh father do not look in that way at me oh i am guilty then you will not pardon me the monk recovered his usual expression	83.8612
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have but what the devil you are not a priest you are a musketeer a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me	143.0983
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the kings musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain	119.5927
excuse me excuse you for what	73.6394
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried	256.1266
dépinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m	160.4010
it is a quarter of an hours journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hours journey from the city to hither	117.6113
ah cried he on perceiving dartagnan ah this is frightful you pretend to pardon me and you poison me i cried dartagnan	119.2418
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination	471.0914
tonight we stop at derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it	66.9275
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who was that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count	92.3968
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows	95.2222
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousses glass and do not interfere with us yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass heres to his health his healthhurrah but the meansthe means said fernand	305.7362
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that goodnature of which your eminence speaks	142.5020
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flowergarden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him	106.6322
i do not know but he wishes to speak to you ah said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult i do not think that such is his intention said morrel	60.3634
if you wish to see me the kings attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician at this moment and as though the utterance of villeforts wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear	143.8202
porthos was perfectly indifferent athos pale but resolute aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow	264.9889

dantès noticed that the captain of _la jeune amélie_ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so	539.9197
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said dartagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration	66.4724
fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat	139.6530
what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers he had scarcely finished when dartagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time	151.3586
dartagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly	129.0201
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	168.9590
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls	430.3958
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step	190.2812
well one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant art thou sure said the man in the cloak	110.3118

he had always something or other to do	89.8552
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested	334.0008

mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel	49.4113
it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners but they believe i am shut up alone here that makes no difference and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here i do that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine only unfortunately i did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet i made it fifty	233.5734

danglars for heavens sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	80.6559

in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses	407.5681

without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another way	164.5482
i shall then have no more friends said the young man	25.3775

we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our topsails and scudded under bare poles the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman	267.1750

suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by enchantment	65.1170
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes	136.1486
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face	84.4017

they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned never mind ill fix that all right	175.7430
indeed thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry clerksfor the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousins place i would not keep such gourmands they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks m	287.9290
you may see matters differently dartagnan and think otherwise	413.9078
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs	384.3041
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty	798.0710
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love	165.7873
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the bastion	254.7924

lord winter is killed then inquired dartagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse	48.5188
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it	197.5689
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham	118.7566

morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	370.7018
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which dartagnan bowed as a sign that he listened	84.7992
although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible	160.5042
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun	122.9877
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you	82.4564
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson	51.0510

in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted man to make a journey to london for her	87.3313
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball	254.0106
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out tonight for paris eh cried the young man turning pale	76.4518
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived	237.9702
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england what is your name then asked mazarin	57.6820
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	74.9475
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarins purpose	170.8728
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos	197.8770
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear dherblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by dartagnan the division being made by the light of bazins taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis	123.1236

my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness go up said the host she is still in her chamber athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat	145.3077
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry	111.6743
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selims fiery lance	183.8501
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because i am only twenty the young woman looked at him furtively	124.8667
maximilianemmanuelif we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room	86.6372
behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them and dartagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty	161.2102
laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time	111.1714
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal	149.8271
i only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed _hors de combat_ in a cabaret squabble you dont do your work by halves	215.2158
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared	291.3355
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep	420.4929
be clear short and precise as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which i formed onewent yesterday to saint germain to impose on you	166.6407
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him	280.9893
a moment cried dartagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their halfdrawn swords	325.7900
give me the despatch raoul the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct	79.5027
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these neverending labors	240.2390
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year	95.2816
at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside a cavalier richly dressed was close to the door	128.3651
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	199.0021
they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel now you get angry and attack our poor agents	509.7506
well here we are at last said one of them	62.2470
i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged villefort cast a gloomy look around him	111.2374
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation	115.9622
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another	94.7008
it is said that mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of austriala portes memoirs	405.9267
he is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody	359.5986
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance	89.7633
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your fathers mind which is thishe is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank	125.0484
in consequence he brought them the key of his ownat least such was the apparent motive of his visit	267.9619
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said dartagnan shaking his head	77.7781
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud	197.3841
you have insulted a defenseless man	22.9914

sir said davrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	545.4673
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	669.9174
he passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full	244.2009
oh no said kitty it is not me you love it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the _soubrette_	138.2411
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	76.0400
you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree but did you not say that my kind grandfathers precaution had neutralized the poison yes but not against a strong dose the poison will be changed and the quantity increased he took the glass and raised it to his lips	171.7108
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be over thats the last folly to be committed said athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy but i can never escape said dartagnan with such enemies	109.2723
the proofs the proofs said the president remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs the proofs said benedetto laughing do you want proofs yes well then look at m	232.1848
de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant	94.6776
be ready said porthos as he slipped through the opening	64.2385
what can i do for you valentine valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtiers eyes	143.3355
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthoss long cloak and dartagnan rushed straight into the middle of it	112.0822
jump then monsieur pistache but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	102.8620
from lord de winter repeated buckingham let him come in felton entered	144.2862
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage	667.3998
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh how can i tell	167.6427
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	98.4394
one drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor	198.0368
the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	383.6656
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme	285.8553
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose	56.9428

well my lord this famous invention of yours must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first yes thats the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily	196.5823
good mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number	219.4503
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful sit down in mercy dartagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge	107.7774
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	112.1297
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it	75.1076
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed	338.3245
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	88.4120
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at dartagnan who was riding toward him at full speed	146.9021
now attach him to our party	741.6639
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the allées de meilhan	169.4140
hold your tongue stupid fellow said dartagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury	194.2671
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	120.8602
oh my god i have suffered enough surely have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château dif uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailors eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan	148.3590
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept	112.7673
let us dispense with useless words	816.5948
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	43.7227
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speakingbesides who says that it will begin again it has returned count exclaimed morrel that is why i hastened to you well what do you wish me to do	86.7734
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris	101.5007
besides what does the gospel say	191.1787
bonacieux to the chamber of examination	36767.0977
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	270.2820
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves	475.0516
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir say my highness is furious to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there	153.6707
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his lifegiving rays	156.2413
why you must see your excellency cried the steward that this is not natural that having a house to purchase you purchase it exactly at auteuil and that purchasing it at auteuil this house should be no rue de la fontaine	118.2899
he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned	53.7321
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	145.9749
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort	60.6603
they must disappear broken scattered annihilated	4031.2439
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman	260.4559
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out	69.7059
we and his majesty will lead the second	135.7012
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	217.0035
zounds what is yonder cried dartagnan	5.2674
heres one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses asked dartagnan jumping on one of them	180.3839
how was he going to find athos	291.9828
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friends susceptibility	203.0364
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so dartagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door	349.2894
we cannot fight with such names they are names of shepherds therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said athos	442.6163
give me some water and ether	64993.9453
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended	101.6061
or the mysterious benefactress said athos	12.7974
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to heaven	218.4562
who has given them to us said porthos	83.0265
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief then do not marry her said the count	210.1173
the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night	234.0643
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	64.1963
i promised to come said felton and i have come you promised me something else what my god said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow	66.0090
de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champsélysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressingroom	83.2121
she had still four days before her	107.7677
i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few days oh my poor mother said villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow god has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him	141.0606
it is enough replied the prince	125.3732
during the night between the th and th of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation	127.7282
the queen walked first every one followed her	111.4536
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	250.0720
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard	127.6116
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel	224.8949
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty	226.6570
yes for time presses how many men have you about the palais royal six hundred place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me madame cried mazarin what are you about go said the queen	108.9963
now let us return to your particular world	590.4619
and as the man approached dartagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern	84.9782
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	78.0304
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation	142.5347
my dear albert said he let me introduce to you m	76.9063
i learn all in the silence of my apartmentsfor instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote m then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingshe is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done	140.4484
then he mentally addedstill my unknown protector i am not forgotten	111.1776
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past yes well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some time then scarcely longer than eight or ten days and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days	158.0251
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery	68.8946
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	156.2047
in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them	140.5209
perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison briefly what did you learn that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals	245.7212
i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men i encircled the castle the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out which i did not expect till tomorrow and i didnt hope to free you without a skirmish	246.6416
no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty	303.2659
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition	146.0412
and a comforting one too added dartagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man	94.4321
the little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham	267.4861
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest	191.9658
i have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart gracious heavens m	238.1163
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	245.3568
thus the greater number of a mans errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it	282.5033
i have given you all i have and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time yes but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london i answer for bazin said aramis	54.9011
the more so sir as it was mens and not gods doing tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything	105.2614
ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand	175.3517
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yesyes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man and a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars	128.2266
nothing she replied with a violent effort	324.1369
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasnt his mothers energy what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours agohe does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are	374.6410
the young man appeared on the threshold of the ministers closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter	53.0803
oh beautiful life yes we are young yes we shall yet have happy days my love my blood my life all all all are thine my adored mistress and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table	183.6695
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	57.1512
put an end to my doubts i have courage enough for any danger i can foresee for every misfortune which i understand	190.3057
at four oclock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables	88.4566
all has gone according to my wishes	124.9769
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down	77.1293
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd	66.9456
on on cried dartagnan all goes well we have the first throw ha ha answered porthos behold other players appear and in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the road	338.2218
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor drank	171.7673
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majestys pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur dartagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said dartagnan bowing	76.2405
but to return to these registers true this story has diverted our attention from them	688.5253
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge in two words dartagnan informed him where mme	240.6548
sir interposed blaisois i warn you that i can only swim in rivers and i not at all said mousqueton	58.2684
athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	29.8853
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he wont object to a soft one take every care of him i beg of you charles bowed and retired	161.3658
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a curate	175.2046
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbé smiled	117.6335
danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my fathers and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve	261.4641
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk no sir no said grimaud	104.6292
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone	41.4804
i wished to live said athos	14.2243
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme	193.6611
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless	220.1933
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and dartagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends	72.4854
grimaud moved as if to leave the room	51.6748
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing	234.2259
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection	378.9754
sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper and how did this despatch reach you inquired the king	147.3591
pah but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton	13439.1846
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast	227.0821
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips	82.2463
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis	79.6169
thank you la ramee said the prisoner	33.7234
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	136.6964
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts	228.7215
his name is said she in her turn	65.2767
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience aw said lord wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain	287.4413
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé	146.5856
dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor	135.7047
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucienoh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgers name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a doorkeeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife	135.7923
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else	241.1856
you said only imagineand then paused	2703.7817
well now my dear gérard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me but my dear fellow replied m	61.2119
de morcerf has any enemy mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my father my son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret enemies	112.9428
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	80.2500
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which i had to reply i called for help yes yes that is true	114.5100
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	129.8216
now then what had i better do return instantly	2125.2952
well sir said madame de saintméran after a few minutes reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live you madame you dear mamma exclaimed m	130.5728
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose	190.9048
the hour of dinner soon arrived	235.0761
_a propos_ inform bazin will bazin go with us asked aramis	261.6086
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him	121.8535
come and i will explain to you and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went	72.8609
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other	160.0559
her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed	169.9676
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said davrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation	405.6429
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	506.2148
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	93.9678
my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	152.1835
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it	143.5970
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us youre right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	118.0709
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man	119.1577
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations indeed m	678.5486
he uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse	390.5237
am i to say what you told me asked valentine	38.1616
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments	78.1294
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you dartagnan placed his hand upon the queens diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late	155.7280
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	90.2277
go on said the abbé it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream	53.0960
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinals bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched	196.9173
at length franz arrived at the word myself	88.9976
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column	47.8199
of intrigues and secrets of state continued dartagnan complying with the recommendation	194.6125
yes i i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment	107.6300
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for tonights adventure i dont suppose my dress would have been a very safe one	276.1501
do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of heaven is a brother	41.0771
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire oh that goes for nothing said gaetano	201.8034
there is now a truce and a conference	107.3115
besides porthos cannot owe you much how not much twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the doctor	316.2313
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work there and he advanced to the window	164.4528
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon	332.6035
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling	390.7767
but no his heart is beating	27138.7363
oh if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardonable the procurators wife was piqued	143.3478
ha ha cried lord de winter ha ha dont you see my brave felton dont you see what i told you	62.5364
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply	102.2487
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind dartagnan still directing them from behind with his voice	214.2092
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death	209.5077
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron	58.9605
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father	332.7631
my father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with joysaved you are saved and she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse	242.6620
there he stopped breathless and panting	12807.9688
could you have believed such a thing possible why you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself m certainly not returned danglars	125.7932
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone	126.0996
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait ah a monthsix monthsa year it is too long a time	126.4831
where and how thats true fore gad these frenchmen have no consideration i had forgotten that england was an island and that you were the king of it go to the riverside ask for the brig _sund_ and give this letter to the captain he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen the name of that port st valery but listen	199.3624
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	133.6516
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp	130.5722
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately	166.5101
bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection	196.7792
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step	691.7127
however there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my lord indeed explain to me	81.8993
scarcely had the door closed when m	222.2205
what then how much do you require for my ransom merely the you have about you danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart	304.1121
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence	113.2275
but for the honor of the kingof the queen well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen	76.8050
steel is for gentlemen and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed it	323.3584
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy asked milady	153.1234
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressinggown	594.0901
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty	51.4304
the women had already fled taking refuge in vitry only a few men remained	283.5236
i must and will see him again	63.8044
ah ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh porthos murmured the comte de la fere	90.5384
dartagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	146.5149
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	353.3095
here it is answered the other	111.0970
he called for dartagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him dartagnan not being on service	138.7932
i thought you were at smyrnai was but am now back again and where is the dear boy our little edmond why with his father no doubt replied danglars	251.5970
speak said athos we cannot see your signs	456.5848
marseilles is filled with halfpay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of m	381.2036
m oh he exclaimed as though a redhot iron were piercing his heart	498.2336
see this gentleman out said the count to bertuccio	37.5408
dartagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed	401.1522
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her	144.7903
aramis if that is all it is easily done said porthos	61.2185
_pardieu_ if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon himself he went toward the door and opened it hastily	121.9005
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind	143.2172
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath	141.5962
you must die athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense	206.8646
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars	163.7788
the cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail my lord i am twentythree years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young	134.4561
at daybreak dartagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done	77.1174
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence you think of starting at once then inquired mordaunt	90.1620
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor	64.0851
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter	316.1479
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man	220.9685
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold	111.6134
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow	106.0755
dartagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face	29.4324
the you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand	237.1930
the two servingmen waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances	468.4234
poor king charles but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him oh as to that said aramis we are witnesses	111.1042
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	432.0289
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina hey pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively	374.5170
bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual pavingstones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening	313.9961
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones	455.9635
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century	191.4477
why do you stop here asked dépinay	6605.7974
dartagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends	132.2161
to break my vow in behalf of the exemperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments	171.0984
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	185.0531
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels	240.7581
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus	330.5084
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together	86.9961
downstairs in the decanter whereabouts downstairs in the kitchen shall i go and fetch it doctor inquired villefort	137.4794
de saintméran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	216.5841
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a question	314.3705
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted	76.2271
say no more about it _peste_ you come to your conclusions quickly	701.4721
i wish to consult you on this passage _molli fugiens anhelitu_ you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf	933.6337
but let us be quickthe king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort levêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in m	90.0789
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage	141.3524
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	155.6222
if you take one step farther dartagnan said he we shall cross swords together dartagnan sank on his knees and prayed	141.5841
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole good there is your money the same sum as that you have received already	200.4358
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy	119.3731
dartagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	200.3657
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain the hostess who knew dartagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair	101.9115
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway	339.5104
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced	83.8276
i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me	85.3386
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse	132.7318
davrigny or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet	162.4544
well the abbéthe abbé busoni monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features	123.6133
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul	110.5607
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	52.1141
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead	151.3736
you will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you dartagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception	120.0702
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchampas it sometimes we may say often happenswas his intimate friend	320.1441
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time	136.3710
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès	223.5835
he were a dead man said the gascon if there were still a vitry at the court and if vitry entered at this moment but for my part before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me hush said porthos listen madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what are you about then he added in spanish anne are you mad	144.4319
he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet	286.5776
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it dartagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you	53.8659
oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court i will teach you how to laugh tomorrowbut in another manner but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls	363.3091
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility	1049.9879
explain yourself grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole	173.0046
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherds life was vampas reply	225.8312
supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of dartagnan	140.5304
it was three oclock when he threw himself on the bed	22.3095
and what is a fronde inquired mazarin	175.1057
lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her	75.0114
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london	41.4318
grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust but la ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke	121.8943
i do not understand you i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him fernand cried mercédès i believed you were goodhearted and i was mistaken fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage	142.6832
then turning toward the second musketeer dartagnan said monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	190.6733
but you sent for me my dear child	29.7279
it was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes	136.9489
dartagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other	156.2513
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside	49.0163
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sisters account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance	216.1239
the next morning when kitty presented herself at dartagnans she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death	187.6018
adieu we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness	116.8495
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	229.2761
porthos kill every one who stands in your way and after pressing the hand of athos dartagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist	118.7838
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you	78.7752
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche	546.2484
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep tonight madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction	115.5624
strange athos was scarcely aged at all his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever	631.1016
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied châteaurenaud	128.8562
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	190.1329
has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	98.6236
do you wish to go to m	32.8879
athos remained a musketeer under the command of dartagnan till the year at which period after a journey he made to touraine he also quit the service under the pretext of having inherited a small property in roussillon	202.6458
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count	5.7630
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	53.1973
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	109.5226
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	292.7426
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it	93.5456
the white flag _morbleu_ we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures sake	195.5001
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	240.2471
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward	100.5156
run run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands cries	102.6227
when the hour for his jailers visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place	221.2399
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends	42.5169
if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand so you know beforehand you must perish said dartagnan	86.3086
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m	91.3698
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road	131.4522
it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future fatherinlaw who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron	217.0125
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man	310.0514
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	29.1487
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary	416.7245
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp	157.9262
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord	183.4299
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around	108.0635
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take	127.6325
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen	128.8116
you do not know the italian nobility the cavalcanti are all descended from princes have they any fortune an enormous one what do they do try to spend it all	281.3846
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room	200.4420
why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother	211.1353
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison	152.2715
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words	209.6765
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to dartagnan that the wouldbe assassin had saved his life	220.5795
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the count of sanfelices flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning	245.2598
i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	233.7256
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	123.2760
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	127.1568
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret	295.7203
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home	138.4467
uncertainty is still hope then in a low voice morrel addedthis delay is not natural	247.9793
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height	144.0216
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès	111.3634
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned back	109.7089
when i am insulted i do not faint i avenge myself and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room	84.0167
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet	64.1558
at last dartagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and dartagnans blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass	326.2975
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket	361.4106
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	158.3274
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly	144.3939
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis	149.2870
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty	99.3151
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	95.6060
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more	309.8812
have you had any account of it none	69.4802
you who are in power have only the means that money produceswe who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts devotion said villefort with a sneer	770.0349
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands	122.4506
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken	203.0684
alas he cannot make me forget what i shall have lost thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on	174.2893
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you	63.1687
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night	148.7101
but it has not been so with mei see and always have seen during the last sixteen years	248.8185
i assure you i intend to play the devils game tonight dartagnan rattled the gold in his pockets	247.5079
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	927.1224
we are friends are we not she asked	146.4245
he has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life	354.4862
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by dartagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over	79.8022
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal	389.3187
morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit	365.8091
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	54.7566
here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building	307.8906
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family	228.0320
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty	83.4802
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours	192.8835
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be	201.6834
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina	59.1299
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me	138.7369
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents	224.9400
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inauspicious	213.2381
do you know saintmandrier i do in the hour of rest between noon and one oclock galleyslaves having a nap after dinner we may well pity the poor fellows said the abbé	331.7755
at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written mirame a tragedy in five acts and raised his head	316.8810
whom would they hang yourself or me	176.3940
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well the messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and retired	120.4143
nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be off grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert	137.0158
once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queens the three gentlemen then shook hands lord de winter taking the rue saint honore and athos and aramis remaining together	96.7892
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortunebrilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any	280.1131
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house	33.8872
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthoss duchess is dressed by her husbands clerks said dartagnan laughing	248.6129
the diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	252.9709
the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue	112.6773
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go	197.9747
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door reopened	109.3759
ah he has a niece interrupted porthos	244.6887
what say you morrel _ma foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready	143.9401
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married no they told you then that m	69.9466
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase you followed him cried athos	113.4515
if it is written yonder in heaven that the duc de beaufort is to escape he will escape and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it mazarin started	67.0556
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers	399.1588
proud of this exploit vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm	72.8053
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo	211.7475
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray horse	224.1901
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with tears	447.5692
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles	106.4028
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote _to mlle	286.4781
it is pleasant to have such welldressed brethren and those gendarmes behaved shamefully	6064.6016
i understand said morrel i am to wait yes but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man	139.5970
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed	184.5916
in an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back	185.0740
when were you here i was brought up here truly it is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere you will wait for me then let me reflect a little ay that will doat armentières where is that armentières a little town on the lys i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country capital but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger that is well understood and in that case how shall i know where you are you do not want your lackey is he a sure man to the proof give him to me	118.4227
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes because you do not love me madame if you loved me you would view all this otherwise	103.3044
go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence	520.4913
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here	129.9837
in france people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger	287.5199
at nine oclock tomorrow ritas father will be here with the money it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste	101.7813
noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him valentine blushed but did not answer	197.6064
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters	215.5952
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips	64.1931
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow	189.2580
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword	149.7624
your excellency he said the master of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz	54.3732
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	125.6494
you always say _trifles_ my dear athos said dartagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never loved the drinkdeadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as before	142.5525
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there	37.9077
even his breathing seemed to be arrested	91.0994
i am credited on you for six millions	152.7200
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	161.5446
cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would reappear to claim the illustrious outcast	158.8089
dartagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read dec	288.2578
a knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	74.4374
i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his wife that is a childs reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner	452.4335
is the spot far from here a hundred leagues it is not illplanned said the governor	120.5049
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	73.1640
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme	48.0602
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	126.7549
after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him	487.8484
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride	714.8069
dartagnan made his way through the crowd advanced toward the host and pronounced the word forward the host instantly made him a sign to follow went out with him by a door which opened into a yard led him to the stable where a saddled horse awaited him and asked him if he stood in need of anything else	99.9885
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious	216.5122
villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is removed had m	259.5702
the other room near the library was a bedroom	180.2874
de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked villefort after a moments reflection what interest can this m	179.5656
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write they then separated	233.4073
finally said felton finally what did they do at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer	193.4457
treat him kindly therefore in the future captain said the young king to dartagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner todayyou and your friend the baron du vallon that was a great honor for dartagnan and for porthos	94.9119
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time	116.1808
halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers	135.8521
my dear cousin i think i shall make up my mind to set out for béthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she cannot live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger	127.3318
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape	154.5693
dartagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time	86.0252
he then said it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of saintphilippeduroule was striking eight	167.8646
the anjou wine after the most disheartening news of the kings health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward	81.6520
tomorrow by twelve oclock i shall have the order for your exile signed _buckingham_	325.7784
villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleons return	240.1262
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron _eo rus_ and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable	617.8682
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly my faith monsieur that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days and me too said dartagnan	114.1538
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand	126.7192
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic	320.5596
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage	126.4217
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant	79.5031
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	308.5908
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawingroom	42.8575
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death	194.2841
you cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him	133.3669
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved	413.1412
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war	215.5029
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window	173.3592
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt	1883.2312
he again struck it and with greater force	472.2407
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids	320.6247
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m	326.4265
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid	65.2744
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death and ii swear to you before god madame said dartagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine	106.1431
pooh replied porthos i am what i am they rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust	99.9800
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in and what of that	124.0984
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villeforts brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed	223.0820
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	109.1797
she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed help help m what is the matter asked m	73.3263
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne	385.5013
god grant you as much let us drink then she is dead stammered dartagnan	123.3225
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayvalentine has been assassinated villefort hung his head davrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes	99.6391
a king said dartagnan its a good omen master groslowlook out for the king and in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the gascons voice which made his partner start	200.2101
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed	405.8193
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was dartagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you thank god thank god yes it is i said dartagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy	104.7188
you raised the whole district so they told me very nearly replied planchet with a selfsatisfied air	173.5659
the heart of the young man overflowed with joy	109.2937
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two is monsieur aramis with dartagnan asked lord de winter	122.6202
i cannot have deceived myself he said i must look upon the past in a false light	110.2390
milady does not know me i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos for shame said aramis	101.0197
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of itself my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	97.4764
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard	260.3014
another queen in want of help	1084.0710
all day dantès walked up and down his cell	46.7841
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently	53.3913
make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or illfated mother i have already told you my lord that i shall see no one it is possible haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris	156.4118
the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower	150.1456
de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court	171.8542
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sundial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sundial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longerbytheby sir do you think dormice eat them indeed i should think not replied monte cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did what	217.1284
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	94.1104
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from noyon in picardy you have several lawsuits and no attorney	603.8807
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court the part she plays _pardieu_ it is not difficult to divine that after all you have told me	184.0856
she was a charming woman of twentyfive or twentysix years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal	466.3928
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	48.9469
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me alas alas what a fearful extremity valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother i would rather die a hundred timesoh yes die no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope i will think of maximilian you are my own darling child valentine i alone can save you and i will valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her handsfor she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courageand began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress	183.6069
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said dartagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties_ and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans	117.1788
he remembered the count of monte cristo	4.8888
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by dartagnan	276.5843
dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters	328.1503
he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to comedeeds and power which none could thwart with impunity	455.1187
are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars	97.1838
is it broken off yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor indeed	603.9590
it was a dull foggy night	294.3503
as for me i am sure of it said the duke	19.9491
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state dartagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos	171.3008
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too latethere is not a single carriage to be hadthat is for the three last days yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed what is the matter said albert entering no carriage to be had just so returned franz you have guessed it well your eternal city is a nice sort of place that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please ah that is something said albert today is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future at least we can have a window where in the corso ah a window exclaimed signor pastriniutterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction	156.2603
the master of _la jeune amélie_ who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmonds value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which edmond had accepted	223.4069
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers	153.5189
in all probability this time his master would not retract	169.6155
but we must say at the present moment dartagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested	167.0296
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge	383.9189
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service dartagnan i shall be grateful to you all my life very well	155.3255
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that _mene mene tekel upharsin_ which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	413.8587
are we not eating a horse porthos	549.5198
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his wellknown difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows gentlemen will you permit a grandson of henry iv	226.9502
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head	318.9230
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	655.0391
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them	142.1994
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man father i will said maximilian	214.8877
what he continued can i have been following a false pathcan the end which i proposed be a mistaken endcan one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking	328.0518
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at dartagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look	306.1219
the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal	120.5567
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriagewheels as he was driven rapidly away	133.5975
besides mother remark how vivid his eye how ravenblack his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkleshe is not only vigorous but also young the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts	288.2582
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature	176.5643
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words	93.7921
at six in the evening the guests began to come	87.5841
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the cross	92.3699
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall lyons will hasten to welcome him	460.7521
noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him	98.9468
how can you find out you shall see gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land	185.7414
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing i said dartagnan nothing and he read you have not answered my first note	77.6171
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway	114.9379
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heartthree of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning	160.4452
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory	226.8130
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them	170.6991
am i mistaken then said monte cristo	5.0255
i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us i pray you the baron went out sobbing	168.0789
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said dartagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos	99.0389
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition	86.8408
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk openworked stockings passed a white and tolerably nicelooking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	297.3412
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace	70.6972
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting	227.7668
at the moment of arriving at st paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself twice	540.0385
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes repeated	347.5938
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	78.2180
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	78.6749
only that there may be no delay i shall borrow one of your horses certainly all the four are at your service oh i need only one of them for the time being shall we take our valets yes you may as well take mousqueton	147.9216
do you know what gave him strength	167.8468
thats a daring rascal whispered the count	4.6921
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	104.0670
and it will be even a disadvantage to you a lefthanded man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it	169.7041
did the people shout at all cromwell asked	363.8514
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyrdom	323.1505
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of dartagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing dartagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other	185.5383
help me out of paris help me out of france i cannot take you however to the siege of la rochelle said dartagnan	74.4371
i do not know you i am said i the little abbé who reads _lives of the saints_ and translates judith into verse ah ah i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone well what do you want with me i want you to spare time to take a walk with me tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest pleasure no not tomorrow morning if you please but immediately if you absolutely insist i do insist upon it come then	161.0858
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar theres the enemy approaching	386.5470
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	322.5881
the three young people were talking together	798.4254
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain dartagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouththey had been so impressed upon his mind	132.6097
noirtiers room he perceived two figures through the halfopen door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further	347.9711
at least dartagnan said to himself as he took the road to villarscotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking	60.6178
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m	214.5939
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of moneya thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready witin default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto _fidelis et fortis_	374.2935
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simarthe gorgeous robe of officeand the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt	348.8110
water oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice	74.1811
and now said dartagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos	65.0989
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties	161.1886
and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of	118.5743
porthos was the first who came to himself	61.6124
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others failings	202.9366
where are you going oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	173.8133
is he not peculiar he is more than that replied châteaurenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life	75.3013
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	182.7078
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle	129.3971
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv	144.3016
it is impossible said the procureur	234.3908
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by federal laws and your states laws	76.0675
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i dont stand upon ceremony said dartagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep	196.3858
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you	74.9750
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum ah sir you know well i would risk my life for you thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet	272.9066
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really cannot pretend to lament it	163.9510
which i received this morning dartagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it	71.9206
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door	61.4018
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	108.6366
athos who heard miladys voice came sharply up	1270.6732
you are a hundred times too good begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight ha but first write your request to dessessart	488.7363
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors	250.5006
no sentinels no one at any of the windows	47.0985
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree	165.7751
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and castoff cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master	244.0183
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day	505.7096
if i were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do	268.8976
who calls me i said mazarin with his most smiling expression	136.4813
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries	91.5353
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them	156.7271
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am dartagnan dont you know me	29.4901
noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	89.7042
it would require years to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other	171.4463
it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way if we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must start athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condéhas he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings	184.6748
you see your friends are wakeful	1155182.8750
no be assured i am not mad	71.8432
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons	231.1812
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door	126.9128
edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent there	172.4995
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx	298193.3438
m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired	74.3991
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristos in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m	138.7488
come back sirs back the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were heard	119.3162
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen	250.7430
but i was going to tell you that i met m	43.1900
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england	87.0451
danglars at the other and eugénie in front of him	88.1432
see john see how well she knows how to handle a knife in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will	278.4054
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peaceloving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air _à langlaise_ and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures	1090.1312
well then we will put simply _my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_ my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	273.0609
deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing	194.0357
consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m	102.1395
caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour m the abbé busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied	107.9347
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter	75.8718
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmonds release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the _pharaon_ than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglarsthat will smooth over all difficulties	244.9124
we must play the farce to the end	95.9716
is it really your intention to make me captain of the _pharaon_ if i were sole owner wed shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb_chi ha compagno ha padrone_he who has a partner has a master but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes	276.4195
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation	212.4966
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed	339.7746
adieu dear sister till your next swoon this was all that milady could endure	508.0980
all these women had been or were beautiful	509.9271
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes	202.8812
the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture	237.8681
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life	245.1811
pressing his lips close to the planks he exclaimed dont be alarmed valentineit is i again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so and why do you come so late today	242.9991
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return	448.5529
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way	194.6970
are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd	190.7455
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin	165.8066
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	413.6839
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody confess you know i have the right of giving absolution i monseigneur said athos	186.9308
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m	208.3582
i hate him i confess it openly	692.1446
for my part said dartagnan i say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle executioner as you were of king charles incendiary i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer ill stave your wicked head in with this oar dartagnan dartagnan cried athos my son i entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him	209.1641
ah dartagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable dartagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis	163.9900
but oh how i passed that time oh the wretched hours i have enduredthe torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it yes valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror	186.2893
good said monte cristo to morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twentyfive thousand francs for which i would have paid a hundred thousand what have you discovered asked morrel	94.1413
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	251.1752
