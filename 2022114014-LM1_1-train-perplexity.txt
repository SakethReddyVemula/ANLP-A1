it is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the rest	156.1623
but dartagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it	109.7288
luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind	95.1633
do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper	159.3647
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish	569.9794
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers goodday sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything	164.7295
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	51.0709
bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their way	302.1192
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord	115.5511
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knowsdartagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	158.1358
the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected	87.7813
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of dartagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends	63.5073
we must inform the queen ah my faith yes said porthos and dartagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now inform the queen said athos and how	57.8284
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result	264.7867
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated	53.4180
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet	166.3249
the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers and the open places lakes after the great rains which fell in january the seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital	182.8437
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk	48.8055
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison	194.2517
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the prince de conti madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door	34.7081
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay	238.3715
not the least in the world replied bonacieux	326.3659
as our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the devils	192.8566
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won	230.8776
expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd m	108.8277
as he gained the top of the rue guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him	156.3907
almost an impossibility replied the major	58.2831
in the cloverfields beyond the chestnuttrees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song	1862.6858
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear	93.7457
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	279.9691
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction	701.1089
as they went from the hôtel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrière de la villette and the other by the barrière montmartre to meet again beyond st denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results	275.5854
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms	81.2348
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	141.3553
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances epilogue la rochelle deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year	324.2829
it was then richelieus object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom	106.0527
listen hermine i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coatthat little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ringwhen i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked	164.8924
de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	92.3614
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarrons pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	229.2672
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de châteaurenaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf	197.8701
i hoped to be able to rely upon that and i madame said dartagnan embarrassed you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way dartagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme	151.8417
no sentinels no one at any of the windows	83.9511
pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands listen madame said gondy	159.0115
now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very day	226.7636
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there	271.9580
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen	167.3854
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself	58.7295
you look like four conspirators oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning	75.0153
heres a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond you are right dartagnan i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me	284.1501
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	111.0137
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm	380.1374
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed	340.5293
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my friend yes but i confess i always thought you jested with such things oh dartagnan the devil why people jest with death and people are wrong dartagnan for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation granted but if you please let us not theologize aramis	213.1657
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there	205.5491
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do	158.9849
but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before	181.3892
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room	176.0401
de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company	270.5876
a fête was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance	110.6142
yes sir come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit do you not guess monsieur asked morrel	112.8156
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters	271.6363
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	174.1060
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him	224.1725
the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sirthat relatively to what i have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn but with what motive have you learned all this inquired villefort in astonishment	124.0003
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pèrelachaise from the faubourg sainthonoré	262.3129
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	90.5871
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come	69.7032
at this instant the door opened	32.3838
or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it yes my good master cried bertuccio casting himself at the counts feet it was simply vengeancenothing else i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished what my house oh your excellency it was not yours then whose then	87.8818
i was told there were such at the last exhibition he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept and he is not robbed no his servants are all devoted to him there ought to be some money in that secretaire there may be	163.4352
it was long since he had any reason for his mornings inspiration but he always slept all night long	630.9216
i have engaged the three lower windows at the café rospoli should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him	205.3464
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey	52.3582
bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment	199.2284
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civitacastellana and sora	1367.8741
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him	101.9391
what cried he in an accent of greater astonishment than before your second witness is monsieur aramis doubtless are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards at court and in the city athos porthos and aramis or the three inseparables	146.2866
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner	48.6623
well said andreamy servants coat and my hat ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do you	75.2126
forward cried dartagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear	175.3549
morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns	74.1491
am i to say what you told me asked valentine	41.3989
personally i do not know you this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	225.0697
de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear mego the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion	196.6161
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father very well you are always the same athos great and generous	110.9100
dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him	380.4253
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love	701.1494
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperors answer	182.1218
both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london	139.8613
he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal the guards of the cardinal and why so asked porthos warmly	217.6152
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy	878.3165
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot are you well fed repeated the inspector	95.4398
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name	165.7295
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	1002.5726
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	91.3832
to whom thento your new master who and where is hehe is here and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydée in a tone of chastened anger	230.4685
how replied dartagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed	432.7707
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father i will live morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment	80.7821
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them	113.1444
dartagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive	240.9930
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you	81.8550
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	253.1189
send me the keeper of the seals séguier and that man what has your eminence done with him what man asked the cardinal	84.8590
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities	113.4672
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping	375.0966
how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixtysix years old	256.7967
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	74.8435
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti	164.9872
i imagined it must be said morrel	60.4835
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	75.3490
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home stop a moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my companions	92.8356
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have them a horse for your lackey resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my friend ah madame said porthos haughtily do you take me for a beggar no i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules	148.2997
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her	209.7651
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young mans frame	145.1031
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	206.5232
mousqueton is propped against the door and heres the key bravo said aramis how did you manage it like everything else with money but it cost me dear how much asked athos	134.6218
you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulatelet it continue to do so this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m	198.4171
richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can and he left the chamber without once looking behind him	170.4128
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see the two friends saluted the duke	151.5464
de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv	91.5021
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	70.7385
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly	497.7943
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his aweinspiring progress m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked dantès of himself	171.4545
he looked around him and saw mme	377.9937
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it	199.5728
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously	277.8905
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him	171.7092
when i first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances	155.8597
living my best friends would avoid my house dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home	210.9189
my dear friends said dartagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners it was not long before they joined the escort	115.3032
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither immediately	191.2399
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties	176.9167
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the eventi was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east	132.2629
franz de quesnel baron dépinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect	150.2003
poor edward is as much m	1585.0905
madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawingroom a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it some grand personagea prince i believe they saidthe count of monte cristo i will come directly cried valentine aloud	246.6037
let them try to pursue him why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franzs host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges	207.2047
what did he say to me	32.8382
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasinesscorsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	252.6604
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him	98.5724
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty the queen of england and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before	108.5697
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me _parbleu_ what do you desire it to be what do you want would you like to know certainly well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one you jest i presume i never jest let me pass you shall not pass my brave young man i will blow out your brains	102.2043
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor	108.1572
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible	248.3806
bonacieux alone the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptiedjustice not being one of the three things which king solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage	287.7835
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing	270.7502
listen to me i want to be enlightened on a subject then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw be enlightened said athos phlegmatically	103.0035
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none	90.7208
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together	5771.0825
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained fortyeight hours without eating or drinking	241.1470
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m	36.2637
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions	660.0331
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age valentine remained dumb and motionless	113.8294
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument	324.9756
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	322.2125
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction	55.4712
unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twentyfive pistoles for which he had given his word	145.0650
and madame de villefort to my countryhouse at auteuil	3113.3992
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer	245.7289
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it	119.1974
you had your secret and we had ours we didnt exchange them	662.5109
yes monsieur said dartagnan bowing we have had that honor	110.9287
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	278.3584
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing hush said athos we are overheard in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	127.7923
but i doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the holy sepulchre you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	747.6139
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken	2548.8223
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twentysecond	177.0915
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start	395.7303
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m	370.8325
ought we to go on asked franz of the count or should we pause let us go on peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming one of the two men was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout	122.9931
no everyone would do that my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent albert advanced towards eugénie smiling	384.3644
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée dantin to m	50.5623
what is the matter then with this dear child	152.5363
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales	257.9723
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately	174.2413
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	329.9303
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couchhe did not wish to die	97.5271
monsieur she said ii do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions	99.4891
besides we are sent here by cardinal mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that general oliver cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand	128.2680
yes said athos it reminds me of a family jewel it is beautiful is it not said dartagnan	46.8911
the steward wished to turn to the left	49.3385
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice	75.1212
the _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a light	56.5786

oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brotherinlaw but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you	118.0798
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england	77.7939

then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	91.6305
having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the faubourg sainthonoré the carriage drove on	109.8846
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir	139.0431
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man i hope you have a sword at home but at all events i have two and if you like i will throw with you for one of them needless said the englishman i am well furnished with such playthings very well my worthy gentleman replied dartagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this evening where if you please behind the luxembourg thats a charming spot for such amusements as the one i propose to you that will do i will be there your hour six oclock _a propos_ you have probably one or two friends i have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with me three	138.2269
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world	119.4408
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	113.2927

my safety is now a mere question of speed at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnière	110.1583
until then you will not see me	49.5755
we were speaking of hanging ah you see how it is said athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh i was sure it was sothe hanging of people is my nightmare yes yes replied dartagnan	157.7429
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat	92.7343
dartagnan then only halflied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance	125.7006
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color	479.9327
dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	131.4191
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts	169.7185
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	260.0457
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	77.6037
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	1253.9785
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression	339.3940
on the following morning at five oclock dartagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mothers recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor dartagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow	240.1612
this time he could not blame dantès	2926.6177
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it theyll kill poor porthos when he comes up said aramis	110.2398

at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_	343.1873
the harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask	137.6828
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champsélysées	152.9007
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under arms	614.6230
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor	1316.2673
be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion	250.5361
albert in his turn sat behind	415.8061
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death put him to death franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	154.3090

my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing	81.4302
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed	158.7708

ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise darmilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine	213.1859
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils	157.2778
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise	387.5630
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged	330.2169
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists	486.3761
yes well as for me i prefer hannibal and why pray master la ramee asked the duke	243.9195
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road	155.8646

these three windows were in madame de saintmérans room	107.6552
andreaat least not as concerns m	113.7330
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he was	53.3765

because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us	102.4575

six days ago i landed at portsmouth well said felton	53.0687
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it	165.0354
at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out he begged for another week which was granted to him	159.1470
he proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles	305.5415
de villeforts pardon no said noirtier	943.2042
i tell you so by the faith of de tréville how so you will be assassinated and i shall die in the performance of my duty but your mission will not be accomplished that is true replied dartagnan	47.7311
if you can be satisfied with my dinnerit consists of cooked tetragones and fruits what do you mean by tetragones asked dartagnan uneasily	636.8608
did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to england solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for itseasickness tempest captivity	258.3534
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	373.5133
oho cried dartagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of ali baba	185.8966
but since the end of the month m	80.4542
what next de wardes cannot boast of anything how is that	115.0806
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheardof that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs	258.2790

the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and granddaughter of henry iv the wife and daughter of charles i	240.3155
must i always be the same said he and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven	323.1751
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meconstance disappeared	896.4751
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	141.5424
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaningtherefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting	145.5070
you particularly wish it asked he	24.0664
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason	597.7224
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and davrigny prepared to speak	158.0627
let us go in said monte cristo	8.2546
her lips were cold it appeared to dartagnan that he had embraced a statue	92.2657
you understand that interested as i am in this affair i cannot see it in the same light as you do	46.5019
what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard	122.0767
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or mans countenance is no longer to be relied on but morrel albert is your friend simply an acquaintance sir you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me thank you morrel then ringing the bell once look said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor	169.3695
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth my fifty recruits from the chevalier dhumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks and where are you going to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him	193.4168
what say you i cannot believe such was the case	202.1597
yes but first give me this letter you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet stop a moment said the deputy as dantès took his hat and gloves	146.2224
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse	136.1143
nanenino yes yes yes said the old mans eye	28.4759
give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him	30.0797
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously	116.5188
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	141.2621
m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator	241.1371
cavalcanti will bring without touching the money	54.3897
then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a sigh	46.2466
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort	130.3066
yes i see for the young man raoul said dartagnan	140.3047
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton	93.8602
by the way i have received news of franz have you	120.9321
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	281.5910
follow me said an officer who came up behind the guards	51.4273
if i am free why these bars and these doors	229.3271
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down	118.6546
he could not help thinking of m	38.0243
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey	128.1378
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	126.2124
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor davrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house	139.9697
go said he in a subdued voice and find rochefort	268.6035
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation	266.8995
she evidently interrogated him by her look	136.9006
madame de lannoy whom according to your majestys command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day thats it cried the king to him no doubt	125.4411
a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	181.6004
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m	127.9450
he answered in the same language	315.4751
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our musicpaper	4198.9243
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble	179.0067
cries of down with mazarin death to the cardinal resounded on all sides	119.2192
monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies	90.8195
her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing	865.1594
jump then monsieur pistache but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane	149.0699
when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you	223.5701
no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened madame said monte cristo	157.1154
dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death	268.9392
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body	219.3195
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	352.4150
the queencannot you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess	37.1176
alas i have never been understood and no wonder	1857.5776
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you sir sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies	148.6978
what the deuce can you expect	638.8713
he will be condemned will he not asked debray of beauchamp	154.7350
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee truly honor luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest	121.4302
that is good to see said aramis	34.3074
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the halfuttered bravos expired on his lips	371.9528
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	49.2189
de tréville a long history about the queen	39.7400
and then there are robbers said la carconte	39.9519
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted	124.1654
now to see things which i cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life	169.0906
then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther	375.0521
sdeath cried he to the coachman	840.7874
de villeforts answered morrel but i was of madame de saintméran albert came up to them at this moment with franz	67.7565
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen	179.4679
dartagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend i dont like people to quiz me sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please dartagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	129.3492
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it	76.8644
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp	132.1202
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic	173.9272
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering	381.3770
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty	66.1931
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre	350.4921
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here madame those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been for they are the agents of the cardinal and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille my husband in the bastille cried mme	113.5297
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	323.0838
i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard	43.0010
well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the island of elba disembark at portoferrajo ask for the grandmarshal give him this letterperhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission	309.0224
now we are alone dear aramis said dartagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchets horse ifaith answered aramis as you see from heaven from heaven replied dartagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which dartagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same here then is a puzzle for the learned observed dartagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near	117.5378
then dartagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this dartagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	162.7214
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	362.6322
the host called the stableboy and ordered him to saddle _le blanc_ then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse	134.5278
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before	363.8301
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of	56.7370
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass she but who is _she_ oh i remember said mme	93.8899
edmond had one friend only and thus it cannot be divided	297.2357
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself	142.9845
noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from despair	426.7867
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers	83.2479
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed hat	260.5815
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	235.6931
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge in two words dartagnan informed him where mme	684.9599
only warn him that it is you why should i do that because monsieur some mischief might happen to you of what kind in the name of wonder monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains what have you done to him then we have asked him for money the devil ah i can understand that	104.7865
does he think we are going to take him in	28.1066
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	607.0588
we have so many worlds in the year of grace in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue come come that is not bad said lucien	127.3122
bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed	104.4445
sign it then caderousse signed it	37.8829
go morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire	183.3649
in the first instance to marseilles madame to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	163.5262
and remember my life depends on your answer	95.7796
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncles place and cardinal like mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal	486.5830
go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the gardenhedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence	192.9385
because tomorrow haydée you will be free you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours	188.6751
private secretary to a minister plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battlefields with his sword and his victories possessing fiveandtwenty thousand francs a year besides your place a horse for which châteaurenaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockeyclub and other diversions can you not amuse yourself	506.5417
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii	101.0224
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demigod has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man	114.4996
we are four of us said dartagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time	259.3936
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview say no more of that madame said felton	95.2855
why did you leave the closet monsieur dartagnan asked the cardinal	100.9718
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy ah ha he said here you are peppino yes was the laconic reply	185.0122
maximilian said she maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering perhaps we may one day be united adieu valentine repeated morrel	222.1678
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from granite then he added aloud but you have relations left you i have one remaining	220.0462
it was the island of monte cristo	2.3058
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed	97.3004
the nails too were turning blue	3280210.0000
come in gentlemen dartagnan obeyed for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself	180.2451
what is it asked the baroness	75.1051
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	43.7561
this something was enveloped in a cloak and dartagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman	86.5118
in which the plot thickens chapter xii	4848.7300
poor athos said he he will never guess what all this means	111.7947
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themon the fragments of all the hope which god had given them i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them	162.8412
dartagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position	224.2987
here we are said the gascon	196.1631
thanks to the garden we yet can flee i have the key but make haste in five minutes it will be too late mme	132.0217
he was too late milady had stabbed herself	726.3588
it is not courage that is needed it is prudence and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave dartagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos	116.2840
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to them	131.2481
tell us about it said athos palpitating	2946.9663
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity	79.3118
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	704.3566
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	215.7059
then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you proceed said monte cristo	89.0387
stop let me show you the way it is not worthwhile yes it is why because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichets locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist thank you said andrea i will let you know a week beforehand they parted	234.7954
de blacas taking his hand restrained him	220.2823
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterdays debauch	122.8465
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone	215.3608
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed	227.6416
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a troop	1183.1604
i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark true said porthos	498.2740
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my earsassassinated i have assassinated then and not executed i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan	186.9832
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture	273.6959
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required	178.4380
dartagnan i am ready to follow you and i also said porthos	46.7437
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	695.1973
m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down	276.7138
but though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos	741.6310
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oclock	200.5802
your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance	135.2794
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis	44.6037
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill	382.1376
my friend you impose a painful task on me	246.8651
everything was as athos had foreseen	1966.5366
how did your father receive him albert	139.0960
in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again speak on madame speak on queen said buckingham the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words	262.6327
ah i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	517.5469
athos and dartagnan watched their approach from the window	170.0442
the people who wrote are anglogermans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	147.3743
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m	72.2603
if i stay in paris i cannot go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur dartagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneurs resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin	105.5634
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments _quærens quem devoret_	1059.7289
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	75.8116
the jailer continued now this was his project	195.9435
mother he said turning towards mercédès this is m	234.5495
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventyfive pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the bargain	139.9006
leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage	195.2998
very little except long live cromwell where were you placed mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the generals face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything	127.3755
the request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up	226.6112
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse	239.5136
father said benedetto i am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them no no it is useless stammered m	75.4816
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile	16.7913
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess of the arabian nights if you like but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess	135.9899
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them	100.2850
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me how dear sister said lord de winter	156.7848
then i went out of the house i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready	234.0399
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	143.2668
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired	214.9684
ah my poor friend i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twentytwo years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh	189.2388
the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of houdin and bethune	284.9084
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient	162.6030
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions	256.6693
the englishman was an original i had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service	72.6814
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurators wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse	106.7942
it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler	148.9097
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high	78.5783
why an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	48.7477
you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements	302.1898
i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible rage	128.0496
yes keep itkeep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures	164.6426
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet wellpitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum	268.1568
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience	135.3269
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir	70.0846
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	73.0357
rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at franz	201.9712
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellowcreature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked	148.6806
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way	286.6998
the queen was in the midst of her womenmme	2597.8184
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become	145.7345
you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me	173.0578
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling	324.3195
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect who was your brother asked he	98.5866
dartagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge	74.0748
say no more about it _peste_ you come to your conclusions quickly	2075.8479
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly	258.2378
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	24.5143
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you cannot so make the best of it	123.0793
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte	76.5121
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one its true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist	194.5133
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you	38.6342
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	87.0120
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat	154.5907
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it asked the young man withholding his arm	72.3369
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i dont know how many rochellais did you inquire the names of those three musketeers yes monseigneur what are their names messieurs athos porthos and aramis still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal	125.4824
you are still with us i presume more than ever	76.3162
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	142.7320
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton	322.3619
has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	90.0889
in paris yes athos and aramis looked at each other	7.3471
fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes everything all yes all you are a woman of precaution i see my dear madame coquenard said porthos squeezing the hand of the procurators wife tenderly	163.0088
noirtier had once made a will against youagainst your familyin favor of the poor in fact m	879.5969
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him pardon me said he but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal	156.7178
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate	40.3523
the clock striking eight awoke her	67.1447
do they know him asked châteaurenaud	150.9228
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and illbred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished	107.8262
think if i am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief true said dartagnan	90.4229
according to the desire of your eminence i report to the convent of the carmelites at béthune where i will await your orders accordingly that same evening milady commenced her journey	175.4625
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then	156.8414
on the doorsteps davrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others	291.4873
yes sirwho is ita woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor	75.3097
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property no unfortunately but when i do obtain it well i shall remember old friends i can tell you that yes since you have such a good memory what do you want	118.8204
that reply led to several questions about the kings capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely	552.9260
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage	90.7715
nono i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery	164.8249
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey	344.5021
dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers eyes	162.6704
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak	120.9457
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger	96.3908
you do not madame at least i hope not	30.2229
listen replied felton in a low voice	6.1455
so would you said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men	114.5954
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	64.6763
the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite	550.8376
de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinals favor	173.4705
fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference	163.0821
they will not dare to refuse me then and i will return to paris and will see you again and will be happy for an instant	41.2132
de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	2941.4167
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever	91.6422
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself	57.5606
ah said mazarin to himself what a sweet face does she come to borrow money of me and he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and handsome	216.9023
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m	123.1420
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion	73.4781
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	472.4590
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	83.4487
or the mysterious benefactress said athos	5.0667
we engaged our word our word included everything	9836.6602
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	139.5094
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured	200.5654
tell me how trévilleyou know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting and louis xiii	88.1615
the more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him	201.4821
this was before his servant came	26266.6152
the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross	88.1115
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her	350.1522
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity	243.8005
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winningpost in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy	313.7406
each was accompanied by two priests	3481.1533
but said dartagnan shall we not pursue that woman later said athos	326.3514
do you want any money no sir i have all my pay to takenearly three months wages you are a careful fellow edmond say i have a poor father sir yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	131.9739
bonacieux the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him	34.2412
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench	66.3498
dartagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond	144.2607
where he was no one knew	3786.1331
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen	343.9297
here you are home again raoul said the comte	56.5494
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation	118.0036
everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse	106.1040
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i	87.9479
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him davrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	104.7819
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber	76.7234
the appointed hour was about to strike	24.5909
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	196.8047
several persons are invited and among others m	573.3540
the countenance of old dantès brightened	84229.0547
you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable what must i do to attain such sublimity you are today free as aircome and dine with me we shall be a small partyonly yourself my mother and i	298.0312
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same	92.7074
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend dartagnan formed a part	267.3571
charles perceived it and took his hand	46.9658
on reaching the door he bowed	257.9727
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	349.1726
i could have drunk fifty bottles more dartagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered	121.9395
the aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of october	210.9880
dépinay no whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed morrel	1854.6552
have you any money the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful	102.4574
justice before everything then turning toward m	39.8004
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm	416.8315
dartagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet	528.5842

the halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket	57.0271

yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble	143.8102

delaunay in which he offers to purchase the goodwill of the house to unite with his own for francs	51.5666
he was dressed in violettinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color	323.1311
monsieur mordaunt tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from aramis so there is said dartagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying dartagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge	132.5955

we will embark for algiers for england for america or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to paris when our friends have reconciled your family valentine shook her head	118.2941
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed	58.1498
we must extricate ourselves from this position but how listen you must try to see her and have an explanation with her	105.8929
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed	355.9590
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation	2209.9983
you are the directors of all consciences	1740.5219
i have my sword and no one waiting for you outside no then you had better come with me thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it	102.1429
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none	129.0565
and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawingroom and was still awaiting them there	62.7529
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm and you should call it devotion added aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master chevalier said dartagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois we havent known him so long one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent	204.9366
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	270.7502
i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly	263.2934

de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy	41.6761
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him	129.2749
and to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floorall undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way	525.5675
in this case replied caderousse lets have some more wine	10841.7080
de tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions	253.0974
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others	105.5169
it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès with the passage which united them	192.4514
which is my best cavalry horse vulcan and the best hack bayard what horse dost thou choose for thyself i like rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me strong thinkest thou half norman half mecklenburger will go night and day that will do for us	1034.9893

peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	420.2415
when you leave this you will behold my men at work	309.7043
yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray	183.1254
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy	164.6094
go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has faintedfor this event not having been foreseen i dont know what to do the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer	101.2183
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawingroom	243.8570
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days	159.7180
has it ever happened to you said monte cristo	11.5084
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached	92.6168
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	129.8654
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell	258.2012
do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like glass that will not prevent me replied dartagnan if ever i find him in the meantime said tréville seek him notif i have a right to advise you all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion	98.8605
m yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	211.4795
but said dartagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money	119.4624
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than another	154.6169
davrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room	50.6198

ten minutes afterward she was at home	74.6584

why to converse with him of course	114.4820

dartagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others	99.5699
let us call one of these lackeys with a demipistole in the left hand exactly so cried aramis	182.4518
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which dartagnan bowed as a sign that he listened	68.8882
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his _incognito_ was strictly respected	322.5243

on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth	174.3252
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m	15.9806
since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all	48.6043
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies dartagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocationwhence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard	388.2652

why should you meddle with what does not concern you the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation	257.5433
laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time	77.3247
do you keep a journal no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself do you talk in your sleep m i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baronesss face and villefort turned awfully pale	150.0947
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majestys wishes will be complied with do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will commence the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room	96.9819
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers	228.2918
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head	156.9573
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the halfopen door and told his master that the horses were ready	68.2306

the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos	96.0365
do you still wish to dispose of all yes but they will contest the will after your death no my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph	137.7968

it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously	148.5230
while i watched the window he guarded the door good said athos	93.7522

spare me then i beseech you	1.0396
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do	41.9370
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty swordthrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you who is it it is monsieur dartagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise	192.0976

de tréville i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself	388.4698
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand	205.9072
ah thought the gascon he looks displeased	512367168.0000
however recovering my strength and my ideas why said i should that man have carried away the corpse but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof ah no madame that could not be	95.3955

i do not know you for one of us then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat	46.4329

morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow	163.3266

aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of dartagnan and porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile	132.1527

when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome	118.0356
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that _mene mene tekel upharsin_ which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	698.9130
you prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖνthat is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow	100.9146

count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	183.3974

haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel	102.3140
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where theres a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place oh my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it still by one of your forty methods your highness yes yes indeed my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness willingly answered the duke give me the pie i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste	126.6927
during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the windingsheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life	206.1079
not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes	130.2071
i waited for him until this hour replied franz	101.1119

simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton	148.1924
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	82.4172
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to miladys chamber	310.0298
your excellency he said the master of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz	57.9973
as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed	259.6585
come aramis and we porthos said dartagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action dartagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort	79.5202
under that pretense you run against me you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient	67.1356
albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge	203.3448
in a few minutes valentine reentered the garden alone	566.8177
from time to time parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but charles would open his eyes and say with a smile go on my good parry i am listening groslow advanced to the door of the kings room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to dartagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved	121.9708
i will repair it indeed i will my dear porthos besides what did i ask of you resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship	137.7533
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	257.6191
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery	184.3309
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot	99.3658
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt and he threw the money into the river	86.4619
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith	142.8935
i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention i believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince yes i understand it well	78.8474
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her	107.2897
what papers the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your childs birth the register of my childs birth the register of the birth of andrea cavalcantiof your son is not his name andrea i believe so said the major	189.6023
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore	3759.7837
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room	49.2735
yes buckingham the woman was english then no she was french but she had married in england the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door	121.0095
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her	167.2899
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck	111.5652
by degrees milady became more communicative	133982360.0000
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a moments silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness	132.8346
is life worth the trouble of so many questions	56.9912
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty is what you tell me true asked the wounded man	63.9735
she should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last	293.3082
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	81.3069
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these _tavolettas_ nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellencys wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february rd being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band	182.3006
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy	98.2719
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king ah you knew that said mordaunt	107.4528
my faith said dartagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you cannot have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay	140.6657
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors	120.9105
remember the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated	1017.9287
then he bowed a second time and retired	33.5176
whither are you taking me asked he	71.9955
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch but will it not be lost oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up a gardener grimaud nodded	136.8727

be not alarmed at what i say i want to be convinced	38.6400
de villefort send for the priest _i_ will be the avenger what do you mean sir asked villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel	88.8189
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate valentine will not die a superhuman joy expanded the old mans eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	121.3170
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	64.8932
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices huntinghorns bassviols flutesa whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting foils boxinggloves broadswords and singlesticksfor following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education fencing boxing and singlestick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher	464.0602
laws alone swamp our small staff	3774.8877
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them	246.3927
this promise completed poor kittys consolation	6904.6909
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother	131.2290
i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment	106.5736
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness	229.0802
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them and i too said porthos good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling the queens eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away	104.2204
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro	152.8917
but what is the matter albert	1670.1593
he had but one thoughtto go forward and he went	46.1704
davrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door	108.1673
i know it monsieur everything is turned topsyturvy in the world nowadays while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended	160.4681
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone	156.1140
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain	138.5931
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls fêtes or carousals as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna estafaniathe only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu	142.8216
this is not his writing said athos	70.1029
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket	41.8541
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french	360.2921
the four old friends prepare to meet again	110.3704
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable	237.5754
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind	106.1312
he gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in france	59.4476
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice	320.7025
i saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count he eats then yes but so little it can hardly be called eating he must be a vampire laugh if you will the countess g who knew lord ruthven declared that the count was a vampire ah capital said beauchamp	152.7037

the blade was round and of flexible silver	2836.3708
planchet turned and returned the billet	118608.8203
the cold sweat sprang forth on dantès brow	16.4171
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	149.1814
emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered	5705.5068
teresa uttered a cry of admiration	1613.9176
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water	136.5956
allow me then sire to intercede for her with your majesty let her humble herself then and come to me first on the contrary sire set the example	276.5854

name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends well said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron monsieur de ferussac the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said dont you know a gentleman named athos milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks	151.3026
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall find i have found already what i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself pooh women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself thats what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever	271.0295
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne	296.1020
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him	111.8217
good mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number	213.8454
but since our resolution is formed let us act promptly	697.3753
all is well we may sleep tranquilly on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and dartagnan who was very weary bade goodnight to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him	151.1311
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	207.7577
in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious	356.7314
dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	742.1256
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people but i warn you i shall defend myself even against you you are right said milady	60.7629
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst dartagnan was looking at bazin he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of dartagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous jean francois gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving	265.6911
did you know that no monseigneur	2106.4385
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled one	410.0680
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman	744.2352

gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris	335.2511
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt	69.6728
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively	1504.7584
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	61.1708
and if i have any counsel to give it is always lose she seemed to love me so she _seemed_ did she oh she _did_ love me you child why there is not a man who has not believed as you do that his mistress loved him and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress except you athos who never had one thats true said athos after a moments silence thats true i never had one let us drink but then philosopher that you are said dartagnan instruct me support me	139.6830

franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso	167.9183
rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow i understand replied fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine	123.2035
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel dartagnan began to recover himself little by little	226.7649
in this room at about ten oclock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound	145.7450
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only halfaroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake	197.4392
davrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative	363.1503

i shot two with my doublebarrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre	170.8219

it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly athos took lord de winters hand and tried to turn the conversation	315.8201
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him	489.4422

please to know monsieur porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurators wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected minxes that doubles the offense said porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurators wife for if you are rich madame coquenard then there is no excuse for your refusal when i said rich replied the procurators wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word literally	160.9528
dartagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	793.0095

oh yes with all my soul well then listen valentine said the count i have a favor to ask of you of me	40.5620
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	717.6689
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked dartagnan	52.8183
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	1184.2469
night came and at ten oclock they anchored	872.2214
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything how ought she really to be supremely loved she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently	180.4768
yes i understand my lord observes that there will be enough to go around we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke	143.6461

a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd	57.5520
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarins mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned dartagnan	222.4946
the carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen	87.5856
the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself	175.5303
what do you want screamed milady	276.2669
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	335.5043
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest	122.6212
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmers son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback	225.5560
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	49.8360
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their genealogy their alliances their coats of arms and the origin of them	492.5309
a hundred pistoles a hundred pistoles for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamondhe cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to dartagnanwhich is worth at least ten thousand francs he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gunfire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris	154.6167
here are thirty francs i will sleep at the _cheval rouge_ and will secure a place in the first coach	379.7042
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition he had just completed this monologuewhich proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologuewhen the servantmaid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah see here is madame returning with monsieur dartagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos	349.7694
i command you not to stirattempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings	318.1907
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor	109.7923
then he will tell it me himself i doubt it my lord why do you doubt it because the secret does not belong to him because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen and he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united as if they had been one manas if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast you pique my curiosity dear rochefort pray tell me the whole story that is impossible but i will tell you a true story my lord pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal	141.8620
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society	199.8142
you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own	54.6220
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them	87.0879
de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man	52.3243
an adventure on the high road	144.9557
in that case i should beat a retreat	950.0494
besides we will have no words about it	1032.4197
i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate bravo thought dartagnan on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos	98.4596
i said a million replied danglars with the confidence of ignorance	320.9314
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color	477.2902
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees	110.8419
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me	159.8040
he is of no earthly use to anybody and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice	57.9320
after having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dantès eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds	283.2065
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m	130.3839
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets	980.1188
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key	112.9445
alberts attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed	164.9275
this time it _was_ the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience	191.0670
monsieur returned maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgracea man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot	1108.6815
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke	277.1129
twenty times he interceded for edmond	457.2960
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables	30.0935
the tower of st jacques de la boucherie	10.5948
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond	360.4984
de tréville felt himself something like samson before the philistines	12377.2861
i yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping a packet of banknotes into the young mans hand	89.1098
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door	76.8913
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	163.9539
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two menhow do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented	387.3506
are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good guitant my lord said comminges i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient was wantingin my opinion an essential onea duc de guise moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice no but they mean to make a fronde as they call it said guitant	283.7101
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	212.9250
i wish them to be promulgated immediately but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no man will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain you are right mr jackson replied buckingham	196.8432
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	130.1758
welcome to ye thanks my lord	1.4362
de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely	153.5718
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho	492.9017
and as i am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once i estimated it at a thousand pistoles i hope said dartagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses and even money to pay our expenses on the road athos you make me tremble cried dartagnan	178.8857
the mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m	77.2136
morrel thats the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings	318.6945
the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim take all needful precautions replied the inspector	230.4732
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckinghams assassination	101.2726
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address	107.3748
dont you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage	167.2289
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased	148.9913
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where dartagnan was confined	209.6094
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger	145.4656
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a plot	87.1737
my dear sir he said hastily do you know if the count is within yes your excellency he has this moment returned is he in bed i should say no then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience signor pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said the count awaits your excellency franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count	120.6154
what thou again why didst thou take it yeswhy asked la ramee	512.2440
as for me i shall be deceived all my life perhaps but i shall always have faith in a person whose countenance inspires me with sympathy you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess	159.3952
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain	172.7607
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	88.8152
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the kings throat a man in a mask cried athos	168.6033
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself	577.0837
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly	140.9500
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	1231.3773
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me	1566.7214
you cannot take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless noise	1284.0696
it was a movement of vengeance upon milady	794.1628
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard	115.2238
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio	408.2865
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety	395.6650
the gascon is the devil cried athos nothing escapes him the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis	122.1907
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side	130.7014
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of dartagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated	249.8705
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend	47.4647
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos	242.6358
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	272.4487
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel	183.2024
alas i am from the country which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets	471.4069
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered	209.1572
danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows	355.3510
however i had better find him out first since he cant want money	527.8044
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately	12595.2656
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh how can i tell	184.8590
_you_ who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous	600.3856
let us follow him said de guiche it will be the surest plan i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne	109.1993
in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him	260.0248
do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us	129.6744
de morcerf came he would find m	157.8970
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pockethandkerchief to his guest in token of adieu	66.4130
what does all this mean asked aramis	88.9942
and towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said morcerf turning pale with anger	400.7559
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes	154.7806
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say furtherthe art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land	222.0157
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands	65.7448
he has orders to do so	47.2885
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes	342.4383
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucienoh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgers name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a doorkeeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife	196.3414
father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugénie danglars and m	186.5920
to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my children their inheritance	325.4988
he then endeavored to reenter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman	307.4850
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time	125.6700
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window	167.6283
acknowledge it beauchamp your courage cannot be doubted not so murmured the journalist on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips	115.0935
well i must confess it does replied dartagnan	64.1997
have you not thought so yes said monte cristo for that reason i wished to keep you near me it is miraculous continued morrel answering his own thoughts	77.3700
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures	79.1305
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work	199.5894
has he not seen monsieur dartagnan at my house oh yes yes you are right	40.5603
in the evening about nine oclock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his corridor	33.5046
we are going to execute your wishes may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe	174.3156
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton	138.3183
de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except dartagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place	70.1241
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward	724.1490
well _pardieu_ said aramis it was only this i had a dream and i related it to her yez yez said the swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but i neffer dream you are very fortunate said athos rising i wish i could say as much neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything	167.6136
this is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall wellmade	433.6158
_diable_ when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father	260.6643
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces	2520.5537
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the queen	128.3156
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you	129.8904
am i to be captured he cried no not if i can use more activity than my enemies	146.7902
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering m i said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	71.0366
now said aramis we know how the matter stands	1041.5591
oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door	68.8496
this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen	1412.7649
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him	183.2459
dessessart made him a sign to approach	77.0439
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself	229.3821
what do you want asked blaisois	302.5269
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway downin vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground	210.3055
i have therefore chosen this drawingroom where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mothers and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals	486.0439
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	87.8443
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular	160.9820
oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars	175.8167
are we not two despairing creatures	6093.0078
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart	292.0212
the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordered with tombs	746.4160
we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost	363.6279
ha ha said châteaurenaud here come some friends of yours viscount what are you looking at there	141.8842
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris	102.4947
la chesnaye louis xiiis confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call	98.1096
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration	166.2359
an enemy in my house do you say edmond if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more fernands eye darted lightning	142.5562
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon	233.2764
the popular banker found that it answered better than count	811.3902
we want money for our return to paris i am much attached to that horse athos and there again you are wrong	103.2868
we are invited replied dartagnan to pass the night with m	63.7473
maximilian said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood	129.0357
first you purchase a house at auteuilthis house is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	143.4632
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	401.5172
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	308.6786
meantime dartagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	106.3557
comelet us see them here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table francs in gold and francs in banknotes	115.4645
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	60.4065
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert	181.2853
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts _chasseur_ also	306.5576
it is you mordaunt he said	19.8243
you are of my opinion are you not viscount	230.4754
it was the marquis de saintméran	45.1062
she told dartagnan that lord de winter was her brotherinlaw and not her brother	66.3786
i looked carefully around i was indeed aloneno noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night	337.8306
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	594.1281
de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously	131.2868
nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage	518.2834
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered dartagnan shaking his head doubtfully	133.7310
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him	30.9061
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure where was the monk going asked grimaud	161.8185
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich even	102.9370
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod	157.7959
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour	119.2743
i go said he i go at once how you will go said mme	61.9626

you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly	190.6952
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him	138.3435
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos	134.9852
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	1643.5464
the next day was spent as usual	67.1032
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired	23728.1895
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel	171.1423
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps	118.4230
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved	365.1548
this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false positionplaced between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birdswas in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a womans caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest	261.8590

i should think so but not without difficulty	454.0535
i must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle one you only breakfast i await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table chapter	215.4552
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite	592.6867
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wifes father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers	62.5924
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persistswell then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said milady perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future well here for example said richelieu when in for a cause similar to that which moves the duke king henry iv of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade flanders and italy in order to attack austria on both sides	168.8764
what can i do for you valentine valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtiers eyes	196.9539
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	115.4006
sometimes when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of parisians all fully armed appear at vincennes to deliver him from prison	149.3905
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends	131.6584
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged	670.4680
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me and what shall i say to the people that they must have patience said anne as i have the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out	94.9352
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current	440.6457
albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man	49.9764
i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea but it is very hard for me my poor caderousseyou take advantage bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores one would have said andrea anticipated his companions words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment	200.3242
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	255.7751
it was indeed for him that they were there	80.8359
i have told you and i repeat it that tonight we rescue charles i	604.2058
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him	178.6027
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongsan officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah but if i mistake not continued he here he is you wont forget the boy sir raoul put his hand in his pocket	170.3522

days and weeks passed away then monthsdantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight	496.7801
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning	102.3988
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others	241.8893
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman	189.0414
their connection could not last long without ruining both	4475.6309
de boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the banknotes on the other side of the desk	102.7292
nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	40.3794
and what does it concern thenmy captivity i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him	180.9701
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness	377.9679

i believe the storm is over said he	105.3778
dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire	185.7675
nothing my faith so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock now then let us calculate how much we posses in all porthos thirty crowns aramis ten pistoles and you dartagnan twentyfive that makes in all said athos	214.1403
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage asked albert lighting his cigar	110.9400
as luigi spoke thus he left her	200.3260
you see its evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not	121.0338
in addition to this after a half hours conversation dartagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head	131.5735
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twentyfive thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild fiveandtwenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	130.0008
who said valentine was dead the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstricken	242.5378
two minutes a man makes four minutes	66.3489

the last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter	44.7925
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m	49.5107
she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham	102.1297
to save yourselves to scamper away to fleethat is good for the kings musketeers porthos and aramis trembled with rage	149.9328
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world dartagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress	255.3517
franz dépinay grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness	397.8712
de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m	69.3317
i may sleep perhaps at an inn pierre obeyed	3195.4092
but where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	82.4094
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	131.6254
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered	550.1588
speak then chevalier said the cardinal	14.2475
i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow	154.9454

his horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling raouls leg under its body	1650.4700
are you not well tis nothing nothing it will soon pass awayand as he said so the old mans strength failed him and he fell backwards	160.0562
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves me come my friend come let me embrace you	115.5165
de morcerf into the drawingroom said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase	165.5003
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him	165.3639
freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms _to his eminence monseigneur the cardinal richelieu in his camp before la rochelle_	160.2184
for life replied porthos in the same manner	20.0271
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is fernand whom you see here is a good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named mercédès but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the _pharaon_ and as the _pharaon_ arrived todaywhy you understand no i do not understand said danglars	105.7779
you are not hurt asked dartagnan	8.8090
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther	168.9065
it is true i fought with tolerable success i dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others dartagnan pretended astonishment	430.8268
morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me no count but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them	142.3511
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest	222.8726
what is it said the musketeers	576.6458
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain	138.6378
as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace	80.9951
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times	28.6059
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses	228.4718
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years well in spite of that dartagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her no indeed said dartagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance you see then dartagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is athos said dartagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven so then said athos offering his hand to dartagnan	124.6219
the hour of dinner soon arrived	430.0067
how many shots a hundred thats quite as many as we shall want	168.8532
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me	90.1405
albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well	142.8058
touches upon the strange effects a halfpistole may have	138.6762
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first	157.7733
opposite the tower of london he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail	101.2077
and is he still in love with the catalane over head and ears but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter m explain yourself why should i it is more important than you think perhaps	137.1936
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously	888.6627
may i at least return asked morrel	254.8120
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a ropedancer	285.1707
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	424.6123
thats a match you are playing with his eminence this letter is your game	108.7346
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count reentered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his masters features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word	123.6293
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers	241.5033
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate	188.8458
yes he is young and youth is invariably selfconfident	143291.2969
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other well done planchet you are the king of lackeys	107.6152
come this way gentlemen come m	157.9672
dépinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry	95.6384
the door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantèshope	1050.5348
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	133.3737
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words	157.1752
aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishops place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall	246.6252
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own	156.0775
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared	178.6976
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board	87.5406
besides you will strike at the throat porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry very good said porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting horrible horrible exclaimed athos	382.7764
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieuxcolombier	110.5690
but putting his head out of the carriage eh planchet said he	40.7674
i will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to leghorn	94.9058
our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect	137.9938
i had been tracked by a customsofficer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile	199.5685
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was all	65.0749
rochefort he exclaimed you is it you indeed	975.4495
hold sire said dartagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute	102.5510
or at least i will golater he drew kitty to him	679.7831
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms just so where do you come from now i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse	127.5994
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain	104.0800
de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentineor still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp	335.2193
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron	405.7398
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were	186.1100
the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention	334.3319
now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn	165.0394
at this sigh felton turned round	14.4980
at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual	192.8144
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	51.3234
richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money	143.2673
the comte de la fere athos athos muttered dartagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman whither art thou going grimaud to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention	191.7623
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grandmarshals presence as easily as you expect here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain	122.3798
i do not allude to you my boy	55.5158
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone	69.8960
ifaith said dartagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand	102.8843
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act	161.4302
dont waste a charge forward aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the others	78.6073
it is true she said the arch hypocritesee i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces	355.7326
come recover the procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale	142.3188
has not your excellency heard that the french _chargé daffaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri oh yes i heard that well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at portoferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered	303.0735
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures	294.5896
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him	29.3315
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blockedreverend sir i dont knowbelieve mei take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forcedit is tolerably evident caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape	295.7623
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse	185.1926
he glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement	1350.1843
dartagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds	291.9886
the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light	381.4956
this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box	181.5182
well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself stay said the young man	108.0615
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him	194.5974
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal	119.3006
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	135.4282
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance	164.2301
come answer frankly _ma foi_ no returned albert	195.8008
the _fêtes_ are veritable pleasure days to the italians	176.9132
speak my friend i listen there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear oh yes yes exclaimed dantès and i tell you that i will save you yet well then try	129.0503
his majesty has so good a heart that he cannot understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained	343.5613
that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman	81.0389
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman	286.2671
boisgoli tell noirmont that i have two guests	116.0711
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of danglars what	85.3694
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan	99.2221
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris i had need of distraction well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said dartagnan	151.6949
he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there	224.2292
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls	266.7361
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries	1711.4994
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base	200.1264
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to dartagnan and a wellknown voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening planchet cried dartagnan beside himself with joy	93.1423
since that time many things have happened to you	81.6470
yes admirable _prorsus admirabile_ continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers	179.3568
he had always something or other to do	188.4148
you are the kings servant and must go wherever that service calls you oh villefort cried renée clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet renée i promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off renée shuddered at the word _cut_ for the growth in question had a head	257.6135
ah cried he on perceiving dartagnan ah this is frightful you pretend to pardon me and you poison me i cried dartagnan	90.9359
gentlemen and citizens set me free i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin	78.4660
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count	42.9107

you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his deskwhen they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die	178.0083

i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur dartagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery mazarin thought for an instant	113.5359
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams	450.5213
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of dartagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away no replied dartagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour	207.4258
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know tis true replied dartagnan	35.4600
what news exclaimed a general burst of voices	191.5259
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	783.1583
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	36.4297
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to milady	92.5356
the queen had at first positively refused but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly	389.2124
never planchet thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well so far so well answered planchet alighting and extending his arms to mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton	270.4706
this cant last and he drew another twenty from his pocket	80.0991
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	245.2115
however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian lifea life of politeness visiting and introductions monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty	308.0155
after this second part of his discourse fixing his hawks eye upon poor bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation	493.3419
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	133.3760
let us visit this one first added he	628.9890
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here	156.5335
is it not a joke said danglars	86.8435
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal	145.1985
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie	119.7893
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired	154.3902
yes my captain as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking	580.2694
dartagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge	271.8029
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets	394.9519
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain	761.8853
if you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your wishes	76.2770
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed	393.8797
is it not so certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied dartagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account what have i to fear why that i may be dangerously woundedkilled even impossible cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swordsman you would not then prefer a method resumed dartagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless milady looked at her lover in silence	183.0887
i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la réserve the day before i was to marry you a man named danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman fernand himself posted monte cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty huethis he placed in the hands of mercédès	130.3478
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect	108.5498
the postscript is explicit i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz	95.0613
kitty came in but milady was very cross with her	204.2060
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos	60.5144
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerfs defence	373.4602
dessessart and inform him of his promotion	1192.3627
many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and m	144.2980
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	87.9655
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	148.5757
cavalcanti but what are you up to ah that is my affair	415.2383
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been dartagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man	72.7997
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars	211.4432
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given dartagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	114.1951
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright	283.4133
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	184.5730
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket	112.3286
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled	486.5438
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of dartagnan	113.8832
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promisenot to reward you i believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one	237.7915
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide	193.3071
it isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table	232.0435
put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with consider all this done	133.8544
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	149.0223
punctuality you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast has the ministry resigned no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us ah true you drive don carlos out of spain no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans	218.4307
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet	166.4911
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables comminges glanced at dartagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up	159.1707
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know	153.7131
de villefort the kings attorney ah said the priest in a marked italian accent yes i have heard that death is in that house then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you i was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our duties it is a young girl i know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed me	117.7866
stop sir look yonder he whispered dont you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows	290.6841

as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail	220.0995
i reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	283.0090
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean he went to find aramis	194.7539
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman	420.9581
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired	504.3199
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs	80.1581
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak	76.3192
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m	117.7450
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the princess henrietta	205.8697
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	465.8582
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful	358.8747
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due	137.2879
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m	710.0248
are you satisfied now inquired valentine	75.2958
de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room	69.4163
she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband	86.5892
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard	137.5019
dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	232.3330
a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward why is he not here that i may tell him so sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs	78.3820
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you	166.8137
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and davrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to sayhe is mad but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight	172.8745
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted	124.2265
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked dartagnan	343.7963
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employeda grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite precisely cried albert	265.0515
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said	249.0834

he that man what man that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted	195.0521
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young mans excitement yes i would do so you exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproachyou who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledgeand who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered youmy heart was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter	191.8046
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé this was the orthodox phrase	280.6834
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a magdalen by correggiowas raised and turned towards him	305.6767
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	416.7770
no more edicts no more of the cardinals guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds	1280.3077
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed	136.9110

scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation	254.6797
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m	178.5651
what did you say sir asked the man	38.1687
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for tonights adventure i dont suppose my dress would have been a very safe one	281.9914

i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches	104.2870
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense	168.5156
_ma foi_ i havent consulted my daughter but if she has good taste oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fathers position is good hem said danglars	123.7031
he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which ornano puylaurens and his uncle had died	470.2189

bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m	38.6887
no less said athos as pale as a corpse	68.1003
at that moment dartagnan opened his eyes	3.9125

speak command i will obey morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening	174.8930
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of bloodit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart	232.5710
there was but one tavern the post	122.1060
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room	151.6517
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention	398.6633
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors	157.2003
the road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the duc denghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of charles vii	268.7102
fine vengeance that on my faith a cold sweat broke from dartagnans brow	376.7678
let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other	71.9435
no dear morcerf you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible	126.7975
coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme	105.0410
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	175.9763
everything is clear to me now	282.5422
no it is in my arms and shoulders answered porthos with gratified naivete	2766.9446
franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up alberts glass and began in his turn to survey the audience	162.1494
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles iwhom heaven protect from evilcame into france i would offer him my housemy own house but alas it would be but an unsafe retreat	363.0949
anne of austria opened the door to him herself	74.2504
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds	152.6483
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated them	628.8444
and i am madame héloïse de villefort the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time	49.4232
the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals	908.5956
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the _pharaon_ is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars	163.0482
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _pharaon_ and look carefully to the unloading of her freight	125.3993
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket	120.3136
the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness but two million francs make a nice little sum replied morcerf	1298.7667
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well	92.4039
mercédès seized fernands hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow	138.2794
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so	198.0672
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	84.6104
monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i supplicate you pity me i call on youwhere are you	147.7770
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simarthe gorgeous robe of officeand the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt	332.6374
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly well asked dartagnan	248.4715
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied	157.7917
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy	649.2982
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips	228.7680
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	47.9943
de villeforts handsthen i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis	257.8215
it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports	298.0902
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it	158.9640
it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	285.6228
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods	388.9282
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours	110.6796
life for life man for man give me one i will give you the other i dont know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creaturethe more so as you tell me this dartagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal	149.0869
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind	92.6327
franz dépinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfishyou have already said soand as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself	209.5771
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets	170.9044
what do you want with me said she and why do you place your hand on me i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistresss face	111.2609
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action	107.0867
i have been looking for him but without success he will be here tonight in what part of the house in the baronesss box i believe that charming young woman with her is her daughter yes i congratulate you morcerf smiled	143.8779
it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger	21.5238
de villefort to purify marseilles of his partisans	106.2808
we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears	193.3589
teresa was sixteen and vampa seventeen	279553.4688
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner	52.6794
de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt m my dear m	114.1530
to the sword sir the sword and he jumped off his horse	105.4844
bring her in said the president	387.8742
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes	166.9307
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips	203.1112
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought	147.4116
but what is going on in this accursed paris what is going on my lord	282.5840
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a daybut in seven	257.0219
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness	85.4967
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his	77.9464
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room	207.7545
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to francs	427.5078
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king	146.7496
the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast	86.1585
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night	68.4269
cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone	167.0966
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your fathers life when he wished to destroy himself as you do todaybecause i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the _pharaon_ to old morrelbecause i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo	135.2646
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered	46.2951
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime yes	299.4868
he asked what was going on	6.0795
beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph	190.4635
ah locked he exclaimed these devils of english how suspicious they are locked said blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset locked repeated mousqueton	360.3519
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmarethats all	800.9203
maximilian morrel do you not grandpapa asked valentine	3056.9712
i know it is a weakness said caderousse but it overpowers me and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick come said caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me	157.9136
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	166.6716
apropos when do you aspect m	150.9888
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a depositis not that the termof five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken	162.1810
as the night before dartagnan did not return home till five oclock in the morning	24.2926
but athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty	262.0259
but this annoys you let us change the subject	42.5135
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought	62.0120
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	836.9202
four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers	209.9438
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos	78.6244
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa	77.5992
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	61.8635
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	214.7166
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champsélysées which had already assumed that palacelike appearance which the counts princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences	198.6309
stop he said there he is at his post gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand	111.5937
de villefort even would not have alarmed him	283.2473
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st denis or in the fair of st germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom dartagnan had often remarked this	94.2852
i speak to you in french said dartagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language	105.0043
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	126.4560
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	66.4637
athos aramis and dartagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender	530.6847
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	392.3784
dont be afraid said he smiling	1545.1252
no said felton it is nothing but what then is the noise that of the patrol going their rounds where is their road just under us they will discover us no if it does not lighten but they will run against the bottom of the ladder fortunately it is too short by six feet here they are my god silence both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking	194.2307
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house the other the physician	102.3834
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	327.0366
after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth yes said the count yes i raised the stones and found a ropeladder and some tools how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment	99.3018
hey your honor cried planchet ive a man behind me dartagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchets horse	504.2324
monsieur de lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full trot the carriage drove on and dartagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner	77.3045
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	21.5241
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit	283.0992
but we must say at the present moment dartagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested	284.0763
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop	142.6615
you are at liberty to speak m	647.7224
and you have succeeded exclaimed davrigny	362.3657
twice you have pronounced that word certainly	283.4675
what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee no you are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention no repeated noirtier no valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment	223.0062
the attention which we have been obliged to give during the commencement of the chapter to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it has diverted us for an instant from him to whom anne of austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal and who confounded unknown lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors looked on at this scene comprehensible only to four personsthe king the queen his eminence and himself	170.3109
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at you at me yes albert reflected	336.7675
yes i am a man of honor said dartagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess itfor i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps dartagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to miladys but she evaded him	161.5572
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the dust	107.0748
what are these things replied anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful	980.5578
apropos if you fireand you will do so for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powderremember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first shot	155.3968
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	244.3733
well be it so at length said eugénie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is i see him the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty	155.1577
m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him	275.2921
one day as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre he was coming out as she was going in and she showed him to me the devil the devil murmured dartagnan all this is vague enough	78.3944
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m	69.7833
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds	423.3887
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peaceloving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air _à langlaise_ and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures	1005.1939
the same order was followed in returning nor did grimauds searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the rue guenegaud and of the quai	335.3994
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared	113.8893
one would think we had tipped the wink what could i do said porthos	639.0416
unfortunately for dartagnan among the spectators was one of his eminences guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it	132.8744
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m	119.6678
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m	487.5513
morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bosom	121.0619
i thought so madame stammered the young girl	13.1009
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated	362.4933
dartagnan looked and was seized with pleasure	53.6490
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold	54.1086
and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which faria had related to him now open sesame chapter	326.3060
i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	63.4522
what are you eating there porthos i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine do the same you are right	94.4104
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society she must go there whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert	207.7803
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinals police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things	128.0839
we went by bologna perugia and rome ah yestrue mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought	228.8781
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen	208.1402
did i advise your father to sell the castle of yaninato betray silence said albert with a thundering voice	399.3901
i am all attention madame said he	16.9406
well sir replied eugénie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie	216.4399
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawingroom where there were several people	79.1290
_ma foi_ yes like you i hesitated but the counts eloquence decides me let us go then said franz since you wish it but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso	114.2917
monsieur dartagnan he cried falling back a step it is monsieur dartagnan let him pass dartagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard	101.0816
it is enough replied the prince	100.6432
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out	113.5634
a great age you mean monsieur porthos	39.8830
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars _née_ hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	239.4460
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each	105.7409
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him	57.8860
i am a machine then and nothing else and so long as i work nothing more is required of me is it possible said monte cristo to himself that i can have met with a man that has no ambition	100.2516
meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased	1691.4534
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied	284.9757
then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abbé faria had been his tutor	297.4781
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began	383.6685
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad	125.7050
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again why said dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishingboat desire them to come here to me	107.5545
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning	319.6105
but my motherno not my mother i mistakemy father intends giving a ball a ball at this season summer balls are fashionable if they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become so you are right you know they are select affairs those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians	230.3318
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	225.7081
paris is a horrible place in summer	867.5239
the door is opened to all who knock	66085.6719
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise you more intrigues nothing but intrigues thank you madame i am aware of them now monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head the cardinal cried mme	100.9020
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	319.5378
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat what said athos no fish at a seaport they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos	179.3531
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief	133.3159
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar	123.3068
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx	102.6623
bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinals people	98.7621
i have given you all i have and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time yes but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london i answer for bazin said aramis	52.8492
in case any evil should happen to me said bragelonne	53.6530
this woman is certainly a great liar	12225.2959
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel my lord said raoul coloring up i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count	75.0356
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	218.9783
the palikares who were prostrated at my fathers feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke	120.5677
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name	192.5987
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight	82.0701
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome	66.4048
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible	432.0019

these were the first words he had spoken	33.2680
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box	40.5667
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	238.1149
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance	460.3156

the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall	74.4911

how sir she cried as dartagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crimeto give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me	219.4572
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans heart	422.6740
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	191.2186

provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	226.6861

well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature and he withdrew sighing	210.5300

davrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house villefort himself was obliged to open to them	110.5647

as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign	158.3984
dartagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself	464.2275
after a moments silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium	163.0000

franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m	351.7024
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	904.9545
nothing but one word said dartagnan	17.1715
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	61.3011
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine oclock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m	45.7101

all eyes were turned towards this manfor to all except athos he was unknown	407.1625
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead	114.0288
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for them	287.2424
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet	156.0056
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich	815.1235

you see there are two wanting eight days my lord i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow my lord they shall be yours you are a jewel of a man mr oreilly but that is not all	118.8767
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	138.8206
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on youon them depended my fathers life replied she	347.5019
dartagnan i am your prisonertreat me as such ah pardieu said dartagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long no said aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts and how were they treated asked dartagnan	121.4248
two shots were fired at once one by dartagnan the other by the adversary of porthos	120.2635
come gentlemen come and albert followed by franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand	161.6930

she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinkingfor since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent feverafter which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere	356.6535
just so then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent	153.8254
when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man	65.0574
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands	208.5962
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion	177.6476

de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience	1332.2695
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneysgeneral and bailiffs	456.8333
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate	35.8118
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched is it then so terrible a poison oh no in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies what then is it a skilful preparation of my friends the worthy abbé adelmonte who taught me the use of it oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable antispasmodic perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and i frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence	250.4127
a king said dartagnan its a good omen master groslowlook out for the king and in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the gascons voice which made his partner start	173.5381

who ever heard of such an occurrence as thisa false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams	693.4382
come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace one moment gentlemen cried flamarens	460.5913
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration	1980.3119
the jesuit persisted in his opinion	184.9182
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn	66.2431
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given	160.0623
on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flagstone	1396.9297
does he often go to auteuil added he	696.4511
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steelwhat if the count should have no time to run to her rescuewhat if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help	221.1498
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle	212.9450
how exquisitely coselli sings his part but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is well then what do you say to la specchia	238.8113
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspiresis not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon	353.0675
at the sight of dartagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken	101.7634
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m	340.8239
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son	158.3292
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay	163.0976
it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing	147.5146
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you i shall take better care of them myself answered dartagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape	316.8479
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz	169.4631
how should he have been otherwise	297777.8750
hold your tongue said he and let me answer	80.1791
bythebye continued dartagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and dartagnan went out followed by bernouin	136.4587
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of the servants yes replied noirtier	114.9967
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions fear nothing there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance	252.2775
i shall ask him just the very way not to know	278.0259
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning	190.6642
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg sainthonoré	100.1389
what the devil they merit richly that piece of attention on your part the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow i will set out tomorrow any why not this evening this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business ah young man young man some flirtation or other	187.9038
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	170.7999
what you tell me is horrible sir	2097.4019
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head	84.3580
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	388.8314
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time	196.8385
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the _thousand and one nights_	150.6576
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	136.6748
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them	140.1831
well heres the case heres where the saddle hurts me as we french say	476.9307
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really	167.0671
the concierge who attended him had only been there since	43.7505
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her sons arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count	160.2220
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his friendship mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man i said mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever	160.0842
danglars it is i do not do so reverend sir why not because you would bring us to ruin and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes reverend sir said caderousse drawing still nearer	155.6045
to whom was this letter addressed to m	91.9255
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you	101.4502
dartagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described	107.1643
m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse	161.8086
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another to whom to the king to the king yes i dare not write to his majesty i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m	42.4431
but at the very moment when dartagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m	65.8891
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue	673.3483
as for myself i can assure you of one thingthe more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other	181.1236
dantès meanwhile went on his way	77.3755
in heavens name my dear athos do not make a useless sacrifice	112.2277
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all	89.5770
at eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that dartagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow	94.1966
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	360.8293
you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here	112.8819
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly	198.9896
it was mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	1405.1241
the conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus	257.6568
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	268.6396
his family will care much about such a trifle as that his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him	110.6520
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of m	26.4157
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp	152.1780
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine	133.8350
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us	211.7096
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators m it is a conspiracy then asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm	183.7920
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back	270.3529
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason	317.1540
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one	491.9491
who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power	62.9725
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme	129.8617
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering	98.1086
he opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him	131.2453
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed	207.8507
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked roomshe who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little flowershe whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics	488.8446
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	46.0644
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings i presume you will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin tomorrow so then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken of course said dartagnan they began the day he was sold and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures and you know added dartagnan that whenever i catch him i will kill him this mordaunt and i too exclaimed porthos	125.0837
crushed and impoverished by taxationimposed by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dustthe people as the advocategeneral talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur	526.4421
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dantès do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned	182.2613
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which dartagnan alone understood	111.5921
oh my god my god you see my strength fails me you see plainly i cannot walk	126.6431
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts	220.4000
give me the despatch raoul the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct	109.5985
you will in turn enter it my dear dépinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family	93.5990
châteaurenaud looked for a moment for morrel but while they were watching the departure of the count morrel had quitted his post and châteaurenaud failing in his search joined debray and beauchamp	132.7089
de wardes must take his departure still in obscurity	494.8221
well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea really exclaimed the englishman	48.4804
reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming stormand when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute	1740.8547
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there	207.3154
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palaiscardinal and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to him	63.4070
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position	515.6083
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready your pardon said richelieu surprised	237.8616
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions	791.4727
alas said dartagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to meto me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile	159.0062
dartagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet	107.9477
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay	198.5879
his name tell it me then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistancefor i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than deaththe executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame	215.6407
in a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada on the th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth time the papers i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hands and i fell asleep about three oclock in the afternoon	127.7424
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking over public affairs	101.3232
never mind be content i will do my best	78.1136
dartagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him	55.2105
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left he is not a prince simply a count a count and a rich one too eh yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very goodtempered gentleman oh be easy i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself	151.6082
and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him	233.1460
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource	189.7768
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead	65.1308
it was an ambuscade shouted dartagnan	2.3314
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honori think perhaps too oftenthat i am in haste great haste	488.8465
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french	173.3216
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino	257.3962
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardeshe whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governors country house so it is said dartagnan i know him now	100.8983
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	128.3514
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent	157.9079
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated	1567.7782
you want to know how we came here	219.2559
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others failings	174.4954
may i give you a friendly counsel	7030.9829
in the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg and future generations	67.5731
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared	71.9803
the cardinals hair stood on end	2042.8932
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence	115.5010
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman	356.9084
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back	151.7312
upon gaining this advantage dartagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman dartagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features	105.1715
it was ritas father who brought his daughters ransom in person	409.8057
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my motherinlaw and madame de longueville	95.2685
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it i cried dartagnan i doubt what you say god keep me from it my dear monsieur mordaunt on the contrary i take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman	109.2542
the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchetthat was the name of the picard	194.7453
the dappled grays volume three chapter	814.8452
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness	505.3550
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flowerstands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantlepiece the countesss smellingbottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orangeflowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber	253.3997
see him and hear what he says m	206.2973
you have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her	934.2380
i have been the cause of all your misfortunes but why do you pity instead of blaming me	117.2256
to reach englandathos lowered his voiceall france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed	189.7561
this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow	350.6533
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done	114.7370

how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear frienda friend lost to him forever and on his deathbed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were maximilian it was edmond dantès at these words the counts paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilianmadame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment	145.9364
now then all is agreed let us go down you are going into the garden yes go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it excellent thank you and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	140.9872
i cannot make you share the fate i have planned for myself	346.8193
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duelcalculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust	647.3536
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty	76.4597
it was many years since dartagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly	376.5394
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment how you are going soon asked milady	124.9105
endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether _we_ return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not my child returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flowerthe flower falls from the tree my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young my father had a long white beard but i loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life shall i see you every day then what do you fear my lord you might find it dull no my lord	122.3766
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips	165.0502
bonacieux whom dartagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him	65.6053
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom	290.6048
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened horace muttered _justum et tenacem propositi virum_ m	11375.0547
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place	49.2974
no where is that by the side of the luxembourg and you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other i believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty sire but they have corresponded it is to him that the queen has been writing all the day	66.5119
would you like to know how matters have progressed	4721.5854
have i the honor of addressing the abbé busoni asked the visitor	422.4218
keep the commission dartagnan the profession of arms suits you	351.8099
in fact the blow was direct and severe	3807.3474
morrels service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant	92.4459
they might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they went	940.9966
thus dartagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means	250.8169
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	75282.1406
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my lifemy honor ah you confess it exclaimed mazarin	1453.2927
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with dartagnan when he was on duty	75.7920
at length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	57.4263
de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinala confidence which he had so well earnedhe received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queens apartments	138.5350
too late by a minute cried he too late by a minute oh my god my god what a misfortune he had been informed at seven oclock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to miladys chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution dartagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton	124.7282
i thought you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as _facchino_ or _cicerone_ and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own	252.1309
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps	100.4869
the baroness approached leaning on madame de villeforts arm	38.0863
in the meantime i remain here	21.8960
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee	157.8687
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance	58.9966
the queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to valdegrace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her	196.5378
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave dartagnan uneasiness	221.9841
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	94.3571
dartagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy	3697.2390
mordaunt ah thought dartagnan the man i am warned against by athos ah thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition	351.9493
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made the counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater	233.0232
now said the baron look at this woman	36.6190
still the same story of superfluities now i think we are rich since instead of the francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of but we owe something in this house thirty francs but i pay that out of my francsthat is understoodand as i require only eighty francs for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury	175.2538
a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young girls having told him to take it to no rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise	191.3872
is your name bonacieux said he	18.7422
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round	549.2500
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her	456.7608
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three	457.8094
what wounded man the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by spaniards and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the host	262.5463
oh sir cried olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting	580.4819
mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied	217.7668
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio	576.5120
i say that valentine is dead replied davrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness	241.9209
i had chosen this texttell me dear dartagnan if it is not to your taste_non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_ that is a little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord stop there cried the jesuit for that thesis touches closely upon heresy	576.7745
a tailor said the host and for what to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert	364.3744
de tréville who as we have said were that evening on guard	105.2896
monsieur laporte said dartagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him but not every one a deputation of two or four people every one madame but reflect they will keep us here till daybreak it shall take but a quarter of an hour i answer for everything madame believe me i know the people they are like a great child who only wants humoring	157.5825
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his selfabasement	164.4590
you also stand aside he said to the masked man	136.9437
de monte cristo have you not i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine well in one of your late conversations with him you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not i did say so well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score danglars did not answer	127.3841
this is fine said porthos to himself i am prettily caught he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme	324.5158
i guessed all i followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all if you have seen all madame you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me said monte cristo with awful calmness	188.4594
another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder	835.1900
hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them	345.8199
ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed dartagnan	284.8553
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol	57.2914
what will you let me be killed	60.1644
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance	131.7500
oh do not say so it will break my resolutions but not mine mother replied albert	340.8378
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city	96.2627
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird	63.7895
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution ah said athos how much time we have lost now said the king give the word and let us start will you not give it sire asked athos	146.1317
eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we	131.1167
this letter had been conveyed by dartagnan and had arrived in time	44.5940
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master	104.4534
de busigny so let us fix the stake you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight	138.8115
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascons uneasiness	175.2251
he has such a short neck said she	275.8717
one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kindhearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence	206.9599
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the partition	638.2535
the fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos	277.4842
end of the port wine mystery	513529.1875
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	142.9507
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur	1046.9277
toward eleven oclock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court	173.2956
although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible	138.9429
and now let everyone retire must i go too asked valentine timidly	289.4657
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the nexta sublime spot a restingplace full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking	205.9828
ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable	219.8679
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies	156.4277
yesyes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness	257.2320
oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close come you do not flatter him i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three times in my life all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself	100.3489
ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment	92.3802
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	232.1307
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms	106.9877
let us go said athos and aramis	9.4975
dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	50.4139
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	128.8357
there there said la carconte do you hear that	62.2231
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise	146.5972
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing what are you saying asked the queen	95.1128
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach	182.9738
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them	89.1331
who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m eh	131.0206
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel	14121.7900
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him in that case go and get ready	109.4841
who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen	37.7127
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant and here i am said the sergeant	85.5165
a true friends eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me	95.2321
some wine cried the stupefied host some wine	4982.4482
i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealers	267.6826
i will not abandon buckingham thus	762.1495
is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably	388.2015
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of dartagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last monsieur dartagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone monsieur dartagnan shall die indeed is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	97.9198
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed	135.1154
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisiansthat is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received	238.6172
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you i must try and persuade m	119.5264
no replied the turnkey you destroy everything	1015.9294
the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world	243.4879
debray perhaps as it was once proposed	784.2596
dartagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses	172.7227
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it immediately	206.8707
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the bankers as the betrothed	118.4363
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count	72.1104
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor and ii tell you against both	99.1185
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste of course i have well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name	194.0164
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward	62.4039
yes to a convent and to which i dont know the secret has been well kept but _i_ will know and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal	120.9623
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillors door and knocked violently	1051.5416
it was then that the door of edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared	87.8465
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes	44.0945
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg electronic works to protect the project gutenberg concept and trademark	20.6398
caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn	149.3614
m at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door	105.7873
bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabriai have sailed two months in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered thats all yes and your conversation is most interesting and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for monte cristo the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage	207.1872
the feather in his hat is worth at least fiveandtwenty pistoles	244.4074
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	302.4031
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	185.2992
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright	292.9926
deserted she repeated ah yes i am indeed deserted you are right sir and no one can doubt my position these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray	187.5181
what are you doing asked he	29.6386
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville i did go there well she was no longer there but she had left her new address where was she guess i give you a thousand chances how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight	141.1950
it was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	55.4332
de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again de wardes one of the cardinals men a cousin of rochefort stop my friend i have an idea speak monsieur in your place i would do one thing what while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions	171.9752
go in whatever guise you choose for my part i shall go unarmed no for i will not allow you to do so	55.4859
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	428.6026
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	100.7167
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	199.3293
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinxlike smile	97.1359
in short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed	176.8342
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful sit down in mercy dartagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge	120.3769
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m	2839.4670
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay	661.6484
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief then do not marry her said the count	241.8231
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty	813.8391
speak i beg you i will never confess that but to the manwho should read to the bottom of my soul dartagnan looked at kitty for the second time	179.0269
on his side dartagnan became more cautious also	7108.0503
bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandyfor instance between le havre and boulogne	896.0537
dartagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him	432.8502
then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history	651.0917
there he is attending mass in the chapel of the virgin dartagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end	123.4041
the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg sainthonoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris	175.0262
he rose however as they approached	233.9527
all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise	93.0017
know then what manner of woman it was for whom today you call me to account	242.6184
i know not whom look and judge for yourself thank you i understand	92.4235
after the king and the cardinal m	175.8927
are you displeased with me cried valentine in astonishment	272.3940
we should be very hard to please madam returned albert did we not think him delightful	509.8821
yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings milady sprang out of bed	145.4058
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his fathers enemies	193.9523
is that what you wish for asked she	168.5563
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized yes yes i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party	89.7515
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward	278.6109
haydée said he you well know why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young greek	309.7001
as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had runand the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortunethe loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle	241.9543
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part certainly i see you are a model mentor said albert goodbye we shall return on sunday	137.8449
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again	185.8002
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their salutation	306.8427
i have seen them before as ugly no but reasonably hideous what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar pshaw said de guiche	212.5607
follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the presidents deskwhat is the form said he	307.7166
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor and that in the presence of witnesses imprudent thrice imprudent no monsieur be satisfied nobody saw her replied dartagnan and he related to m	249.2189

this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true	120.6483

when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the goodlooking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination	161.4312
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years	1337.5171

andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in rue de la chaussée dantin	203.7168
well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness	297.8511
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a firstrate esquire after bowing to athos and dartagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted	179.9128
they rose about eight oclock in the winter about six in summer and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m	296.0075

well eagerly demanded all his three friends	142.0662
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand which means goodday sir i am anxious to know the state of your health he calls that a language but never mind that will do capitally dartagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs	124.8765
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it	291.9590

the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count	139.7997
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	238.6263

and do you believe he knew you again kitty i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him but perhaps it was too late go down athoshe mistrusts you less than meand see if he be still at his door athos went down and returned immediately	237.1084
he then said it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of saintphilippeduroule was striking eight	212.1874
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressingroom	482.8878
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoners escape	203.0033
aha what blood at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	56.4632
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	108.7907
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover	234.6769

this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name	113.8088
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to dartagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him	112.7037

i have it with me the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priests garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure	237.2820
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their soninlaw	177.4815

to the smaller i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen well what has happened to them they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and dartagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken swordblade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis	127.3790

he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again	158.6777
are you not married asked the countess	20.6156
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis	231.4733
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait	866.7264
now there remains the chevalier or the abbé dherblay as your majesty pleases does he wish to be a bishop no madame something easier to grant what it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville the queen smiled	68.5911
to the questions which dartagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad then replied he my visit is illtimed you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will withdraw no no said milady	189.0468
that depends when do you leave tomorrow evening at five oclock in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning	183.7768
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down	355.3285
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips	1128.8562
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best ah m	87.2411
oh no there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu i dont even know their names yes but in regard to myself my lord it cannot be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence you think you were i am certain of it ah stay i fancy i remember it	110.8625
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey	158.0371
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no faith said madame de chevreuse say on	101.5837
you would expose the selflove of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle but yet m	225.0543
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m	240.9893
danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence	390.1907
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it	195.6806
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to lepee du grand henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us there the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated	209.9109
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him	90.4281
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voicesone deep whisperintimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle	1041.4204
dépinay can have displeased your father more than any other person i believe i know m	93.4191
we two are worth a dozen yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirtysix more especially as you say the work will not be childs play	153.5080
the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short	174.5466
there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day	74.7933
i always had a desire to have a mute in my service so learning the day his tongue was cut out i went to the bey and proposed to give him for ali a splendid doublebarreled gun which i knew he was very desirous of having	175.7892
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge	155.2724
during this time porthos played close	556.5820
eh i read it a little while since	415.4662
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously	51.6688
have you seen him i left him five days ago said dartagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston	254.5898
their masters are dead i thought they might be useful so i took them meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols	217.5854
adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away	118.9149
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say dartagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question	96.5919
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at dartagnan	86.9077
m here is your chamber for tonight said he	748.5256
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his pockets	91.7381
you are at home said he	17.0593
villeforts brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension	496.7936
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this	139.0279
m it is just as i tell you i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure	40.4156
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saintremy	207.6292
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his lifegiving rays	166.1602
and does he not live in the champsélysées yes no ah said caderousse no yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior	119.9843
at last it became aramiss turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeededas he said by selling some theological booksin procuring a few pistoles	313.4120
what do you tell me truth my friend	1634.1609
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved everything shall be done as you say athos	69.0368
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de saintméran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand	96.2999
de villefort cried the king is the messengers name m	437.4885
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers	175.5879
that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the servantsyou understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government	571.2350
oh my mother exclaimed albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and meyou cannot have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house andand to you i also replied mercédès am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me have i deceived myself mother said albert with firmness	193.8931
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the case	59.2969
oh muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond m	171.0285
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning	212.6750
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me	559.3805
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal m i understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	284.8129
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping i do not understand you you rely on the usurpers return we do you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the th or th he will be at lyons and on the th or th at paris the people will rise yes to go and meet him he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him yes to escort him into the capital	126.2746
then he thought he was going to die	58.8128
why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	203.0699
she has taken care for herselfat least i hope sofor her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me	517.7854
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said dartagnan	153.0684
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion	326.6644
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing	2666.7317
dartagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	160.3493
then she rang for her ladys maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen	139.3521
monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce	672.5548
up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury	699.3754
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner	265.7439
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sireit is the will of heaven the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked	201.6747
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a restingplace in his heart	420.8052
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and i well youthe cardinal would have given you letters of nobility did he tell you so yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise be satisfied replied bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet time the ninny murmured mme	188.6765
many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial	498.2291
everything was in the same state	119.8505
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all oh cried the executioner all all all answer then	99.9617
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	307.5412
write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at tours aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends	184.9244
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing	118.4715
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii	133.6345
de blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to place in them	235.8650
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim	137.6807
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard	65.3987
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m	102.1936
if you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every precaution	222.9364
at one of the doors that by which he had entered i placed our scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again	64.6317
it was alas the ghost of former greatness	486.5577
i was mistaken said the host hes not quite dumb	222.9677
athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	25.3849
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other	102.4347
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing decidedly my dear athos said dartagnan i should like better not to risk anything thats a pity said athos coolly	155.5477
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not	42.5327
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet	182.5689
the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone	450.7605
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	118.4048
he remained there some time alone	253.6698
i follow you though i am not hungry come if one cant always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor athos the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely dartagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host	145.2174
i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights	223.9178
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure	168.0646
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them	100.8861
the robust scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him	174.9342
bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast	169.5961
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	111.3912
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as i suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror it however proved otherwise	268.8284
but dartagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped	93.9527
just heaven what have i read cried the duke	54.2031
im afraid we are prisoners whispered dartagnan to his friend	63.6106
the cry proceeded from the grotto	1475.1508
and what makes me all the more wretched sir is that i was the cause of this misfortune how so asked athos	104.4300
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	137.5020
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once i cannot believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	159.9850
oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court i will teach you how to laugh tomorrowbut in another manner but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls	408.3918
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerorswhich they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts	236.3159
i will shape it out for you with my knife and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	116.0379
what beautiful furniture there must be in it have you ever seen the tuileries no well it surpasses that it must be worth ones while to stoop andrea when that good m	222.7982
how is that you asked me for five hundred men did you not	52.2301
m yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name	108.8311
scott of course the son of an illfated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy deaththe abbot ch	692.4569
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle	84.0809
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton	506.0437
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow so tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back again	202.2180
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he	51.7155
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and dartagnan more than anyone	121.9544
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth	101.6594
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	193.5198
at that moment dartagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look	382.2625
te deum for the victory of lens	47.1474
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay	158.5032
through the grating however dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saintlaurent and the rue taramis to the quay	155.7715
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	45.7929
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile it is over now and i am much better chapter	75.0919
yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle yes madame and i were there two years ago	104.5249
i have not forgotten all i owe thee	218.3803
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead	101.9080
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another	412.8844
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help	162.1804
de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair i have no objection replied m	76.8717
they are no longer sure planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton	170.3609
endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man	178.0269
you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree but did you not say that my kind grandfathers precaution had neutralized the poison yes but not against a strong dose the poison will be changed and the quantity increased he took the glass and raised it to his lips	124.2119
monsieur maninahurry you can find me without running_me_ you understand and where i pray you near the carmesdeschaux at what hour about noon about noon	471.6216
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say	56.8694
three hundred pistoles oh plenty that would carry you to the end of the world	20.0472
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the periodmeanness stinginess fasts but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurators wife had been tolerably liberalthat is be it understood for a procurators wifehe hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind	424.4500
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name speak or no absolution the dying man collected all his forces	213.1625
what you do not know have you neglected to obtain information on that point	113.0498
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain	46.8255
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column	128.4069
but that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess	43.9544
will you dine with me asked harrison of dartagnan	134.7093
what has he done madame said dartagnan	11.7731
well the abbéthe abbé busoni monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black hair which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features	191.5872
olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musketshots	306.0171
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	907.8062
it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities how so because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsicans nature to revenge himself what do you mean by having made a stiffhaving assassinated a man said franz continuing his investigation	129.7485
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man	35.6812
i was then obliged to come back again	156.0265
oh queen queen you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that	284.3506
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter	115.7806
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	203.0810
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said dartagnan	131.6694
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage	200.8597
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man	4.8699
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress	194.8327
well what are you doing countto a former lackey	18905.1367
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition what that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me dont dream it athos	151.7244
i had the money with me i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to auteuil	264.5517
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings	566.7337
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m	76.4697
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	225.8051
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel	86.7743
they reached the queens apartments but were compelled to stop in the antechamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england	436.7619
bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained	129.0208
ah yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine kings cockatoo you shall see and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor broussel is being arrested help sir said comminges declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king i obey i obey sir cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority	180.7953
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacinglyfor large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm	237.4196
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hairoh who will deliver me from this man	115.7779
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on	139.7501
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done	164.6423
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate	162.8980
notwithstanding all the pains he took dartagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three newmade friends	405.2276
she was within three steps of the bottom she already heard morrels voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor	234.5818
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	145.3427
go on baptistin then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son you hearmajor bartolomeo cavalcantia man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of _the inferno_ you remember it do you not	423.8638
it was scarcely eleven oclock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m	88.3807
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand	72.9169
what did you answer him that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see well what did he say then that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview the snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal replied the young man smiling	73.4806
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it the marquis of saintméran returned the count	67.6094
aramis and dartagnan whispered to each other	27.5394
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already due	168.0759
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented	76.8841
preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags	1018.9077

where is the countwhere is haydée look said jacopo	1032.6313
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that dartagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheardof things which were taking place	172.9721

they proceeded to the rue saint denis	15.4888

whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwells tent dartagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle	132.6672
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house	113.4566
you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses that is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our blood	267.8052
an instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four oclock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house	107.4646

i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag	199.0986
so dartagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply	160.0741
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself	91.1316

besides maximilian morrel though hardly twoandtwenty had great influence over his father	241.3120
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saintantoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porters absence	162.6170
you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since i came here	258.4458
grief has consumed her said villefortyes grief doctor after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	242.8944
athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be taken	94.9819

andrea extended his hand bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money	190.9234
adieu perhaps farewell at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw	91.5848
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound ah hell come round thought dartagnan thats not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to dartagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics	122.9924

and the other which the short one oh he was not a gentleman ill answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration some lackey murmured dartagnan	222.8405
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine the count smiled	98.9711

help help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue	185.0719
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel	174.0824
de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine but the accomplice shall become the avenger	135.4206
people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it porthos arrived a minute after dartagnan	119.4283
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but cannot they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions well sir go said louis xviii and remember that i am waiting for you i will but go and return sire i shall be back in ten minutes and i sire said m	197.2003

alas said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth	278.7459
climb up said he to dantès	306.8066
in one of the mourningcoaches beauchamp debray and châteaurenaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness	166.1001

but what are you going to fight about athos asked aramis	130.5576
no replied athos and he oh he now we may say at last thank heaven he is really dead	129.0194
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway	284.0393
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain	677.8591
never more to be separated why as to thati think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it as for me you must know i cannot possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life where are these papers then here they are andrea seized the certificate of his fathers marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents	108.5190
here is what i am looking for thought dartagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him	81.6445
you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion	431.8246
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everythingkiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himselfat the first signal given by my father	223.1139

oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france	76.9168
in addition to this dartagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de tréville he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren fieldsan accessory to the preauxclercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose	120.8361
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant	64.1234
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him	76.6028

but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows	235.3293
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	257.8349
danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate fortunes i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins	198.6609
a _rondeau_ said the curate mechanically	6604.2227

ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of oneand now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar	248.3253
adieu i also intend from this time to work on my own account	138.8957

athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion	254.3600
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	114.2144
now in my turn let me give you my instructions i am all attention present yourself at the wicket of the louvre on the side of the rue de lechelle and ask for germain well and then he will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words tours and bruxelles he will at once put himself at your orders and what shall i command him to go and fetch monsieur laporte the queens _valet de chambre_ and when he shall have informed him and monsieur laporte is come you will send him to me that is well but where and how shall i see you again do you wish to see me again certainly well let that care be mine and be at ease i depend upon your word you may dartagnan bowed to mme	84.8071

was going when he was assassinated every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the fashion	650.2959
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerfs face	106.5595

you guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest	95.7342

this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed	156.8746
tell me now if persistence is not a virtue my faith but this is droll cried dartagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter	100.0372

a ball had passed through his breast	59.7267
i can scarcely credit it nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m	177.7888
such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert and the man in the little blue cloak and will that be the first time you ever took that journey yes it will	143.4432
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead	87.5179
how happy you are in being exempt from all this well and why should not you be free too	162.1778
toward the town of louvres was the reply	34.9382
is monsieur your brother said dartagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing	176.7582

one of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore	758.1461

i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied dartagnan not to lead ones neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them dartagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute italian	249.2586
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on	410.7869
they were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them	97.3898
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass	664.5802
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill	172.9914
what is there astonishing in that and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me no so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel for you alone the deuce what tenderness my sister but am i not your nearest relative demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness	129.1709

the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere	18.6582
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk besides should any illluck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended	239.1318
besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so thanks monsieur said monte cristo i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but i cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared what cried morcerf you are then going to a hotelthat will be very dull for you was i so badly lodged at rome said monte cristo smiling	98.8949
there still remained planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step	45.6105
i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled	291.5092
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie	220.4478

and now where is he gone inquired dartagnan	2674.9053
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world	46.3368
dartagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy	108.7164

whom the man we are seeking it seems said dartagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries come replied the same lofty tone answer are you waiting for him underneath these windows	200.2273
no but we are going to replied dartagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground	68.6636
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situatedneither too near paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility	379.5389
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies	120.4477
it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent	124.2261
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	380.8275
arrived at ryston dartagnan assembled his friends	17.9917
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late	283.2022
thanks for those sweet words oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks oh my lord you have ill understood wrongly interpreted i did not mean to say silence silence cried the duke	206.0209
morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m	327.3637
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do	18.5487
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the welloiled hinges and locks told quite another story	335.9048
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	77.5889
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar	147.2741
well i will teach you how to behave yourself and i will send you back to your mass book master abbé	221.3673
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	265.0522
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances	370.6716
our host has a wellfurnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating hole	287.3798
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneat least so it is saidand i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeatit is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions	471.9352
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers	126.7100
you will deliver this letter to milady	16.9060
yes what is it have you confidence in me give your orders said the three musketeers	100.3926
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	136.2508
listen he said today is the th of september is it not yes today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay yes we know that well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house what will happen then why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a bankrupt oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	89.9910
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them	32.6823
come gentlemen your swords said the duke	12.3537
silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came but where and when shall i see you again cried dartagnan	76.6081
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before	427.9991
i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart	142.5958
touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too	169.1490
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as dartagnan says will carry the letter well said cried aramis you dont often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth	217.1578
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water	143.1353
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	80.7671
dartagnan was a woman and still more a mother	244.1856
night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark	125.5038
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal	303.1396
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh	571.6473
it was her first and on what an occasion each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy	213.3897
i beg you to do so replied albert	29.8003
well his love is half real half fanciful	8029.9102
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell	58.2613
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressingroom	143.2624
ah diavolo he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of devils and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps	93.3617
you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven	122.8796
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate	124.8470
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties	228.0745
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured dartagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence	175.8992
myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing	1149.4014
he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions	323.2342
were i in her majestys place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen	74.7307
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne	247.5724
i name only the most important you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these yes i speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greeki dont speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself improve yourself repeated dantès why how can you manage to do so why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium	189.4635
she has met mademoiselle de villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis	212.2770
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses	175.2700
dartagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted	174.5112
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	76.6369
oh yes it is you indeed from what he has told me i know you now	78.7747
bring me a _carafe_ of water said the abbé	32.1177
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	199.3794
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria	201.3703
de villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold	93.7372
meanwhile what are you going to do i yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true	156.5202
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered	163.5225
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation	137.0838
de monte cristo you must demand an explanation yes and we are going to his house reflect morcerf one moment before you go on what shall i reflect on the importance of the step you are taking is it more serious than going to m	122.9252
they were perhaps in league with him oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m	55.4073
in he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos	64.2894
a moment later the grayheaded man was beside him	53.6259
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead	229.7079
certainly not certainly not exclaimed mazarin	79.6578
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me oh oh said dartagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso	153.3428
when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a signa mere fishermans hut	749.1776
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys	69.3233
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife	56.5661
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	9007.9570
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master	292.7170
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists there were landscapes by dupré with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies delacroixs arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces _aquarelles_ of boulanger representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic _pastels_ by giraud and müller representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin sketches torn from the album of dauzats travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosquein a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past	739.8265
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter dartagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes	100.2314
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with such a heart as yoursand such a swordone passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed	333.1700
dépinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection	241.0134
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond	80.4805
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness	320.1754
dartagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queens apartment	174.3083
de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her	113.6856
dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	100.4819
why did you talk of a regiment athos	276.8300
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much information	158.3339
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper	185.8049
she knew her brotherinlaw to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues	319.7047
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening	483.4776
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish	349.3130
bravo youve killed him i think no wounded his horse only what would you have my dear fellow	194.5760
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note abovenothing can be done he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrels petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say was in villeforts handwriting	268.2139
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number one	193.1718
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it	24.3388
move monsieurmove away i entreat you you are exactly in the spot what spot where he fell m my dear monsieur bertuccio said monte cristo laughing control yourself we are not at sartène or at corte	276.2343
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger	163.1409
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressingroom which led by a side staircase down to the yardeugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle darmilly scarcely raised with both hands	328.8583
he wasnay probably may still bea bonapartist and is called noirtier i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort	513.5624
aramis cried athos dont fire ah ha is it you aramis said porthos	179.7030
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de vaugirard	67.4366
at last they reached the tennis court	1338.6119
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity	274.0073
de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor	19.4049
noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	61.6668
what do you meanthe album i want the album how dare you tear out the drawings oh it amuses me gogo at once i wont go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way	366.6777
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said athos	101.6889
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	15.7824
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	298.2944
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	147.2082
i am brother to parry his majestys lackey athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings tent	102.1182
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in length	224.2197
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages	679.0823
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peters by daylight	229.7539
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos	190.2931
i am not like you viscount you like your title do you not certainly replied albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied danglars	207.1481
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also monte cristo gently smiled and saidi was there at the same time pointing to the corner of a street	206.3465
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon	162.3189
besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which _la jeune amélie_ replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come	158.4338
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other sidewhat do you see	206.2453
her pose which i must admit was rather free wounded this officer	412.7805
can i be of any use to you chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	112.1504
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier	73.8343
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	43.8035
you must set out for boulogne	875.8958
but our troop horses said aramis	22.9244
there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice _altisimâ voce_	800.3785
alls well he cried as he entered i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow	661.1265
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat	121.1184
you will hear again from me come come thought dartagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good school the different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word the queen standing near the door dartagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away	177.6557
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from tours shaping their course toward spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn why really it was all exactly as you say cried madame de chevreuse clapping her hands	188.8618
ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me i wish my lord would make me one promise what speak tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught theres every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to behung true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest now resumed grimaud ive only one thing more to askthat your highness will continue to detest me ill try said the duke	293.1027
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak	59.2814
he held a vial of salts in his hand	35.5932
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it	103.0300
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine i have already told you that we do not sell at retail well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive they are all the same price and what is that twentyfive thousand francs a bottle tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness harpagon alone has been capable of revealingtell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal it is possible such may be the masters intention the masterwho is he the person to whom you were conducted yesterday where is he here let me see him certainly and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars	185.2807
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputygovernor of the chateau	122.3640
no madame they struck me always struck me m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush	359.3771
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to davrigny and said and now the priest is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked davrigny	152.7761
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces	147.3145
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him	207.9959
dartagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense	101.1602
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed dartagnan aside with his hand	143.0358
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the kings attorney and thats all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke	152.5664
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy	105.8710
it is he exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos it is he i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken whom do you mean asked aramis	60.2245
each had his own particular visit to make	88.8981
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense	311.3871
today is the twentieth of september	289.7001
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	233.8449
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	467.0816
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondys suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinals hat seems to belong already to his noble brow ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought gondy	177.5194
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling	769.6714
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a motherofpearl knife inlaid with gold	116.6411
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france	158.7835
and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company	47.1918
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter yes davrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation	136.4878
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo	37.1517
if i should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance meantime the young woman continued to advance counting the houses and windows	131.8220
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks	104.2709
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men	103.6795
ah yes that is the name certainly	70691.6250
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety	222.9802
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully	524.2005
now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table	535.8460
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	594.7338
if you can my dear dartagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris then said aramis this falls out very well he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty	76.8853
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same	42.3692
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès thats all right edmond	60.0013
i know it and now the ranks began to open	161.1239
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste	334.7112
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	176.2692
may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m	119.4905
he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen	196.8927
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	174.4761
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible	143.3904
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside	626.9396
when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution	351.6367
pyramus and thisbe about twothirds of the way along the faubourg sainthonoré and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the widespreading chestnuttrees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of louis xiii	356.7782

i was at the end of my journey and of my credit	114.9038
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle	200.6848

we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels	203.8071
they laugh best who laugh last having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawingroom whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée dantin	276.9211
am i to put this construction on your visit yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny wait a momentno threats if you please m	211.9300
dartagnan went to the window with his habitual composure	377.4436
deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week sir said franz i have one request to make what is it i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de châteaurenaud to be present at this signature you know they are my witnesses half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall you send i prefer going sir i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready franz bowed and left the room	132.0078
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	213.3978
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed	113.8472
gentlemen i am young scarcely twentythree years old	277.5374
he is only twoandtwentyhe will gain himself a reputation what do you think of that albertat twoandtwenty to be thus famous yes and at his age alexander cæsar and napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him so continued franz the hero of this history is only twoandtwenty scarcely so much is he tall or short of the middle heightabout the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to albert	190.5417
i will not have you left alone so long	123.7212

he bowed with great friendship to the count	20.0180
m no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor	204.0134
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	348.1347
at the end of three months he had learned to read	63.9384
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	434.1274
supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of dartagnan	195.5443
about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his housefor a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised in what way	118.3207
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs	520.5263
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	2230.0212
beauchamp she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moments reflection yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly yes my mother said albert i will return and woe to the infamous wretch but first of all i must get there he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo	94.7893
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur dartagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen	48.6396
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman was my mother the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard	109.8861
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortunebrilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any	263.3405
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me fie madame fie said porthos as if disgusted	106.1349
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul	130.6898
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	159.1294
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was	110.6537
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her	144.1111
two or three times a week	668.5439
thanks monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you	94.0236
the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo but dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twentyfive miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there	142.5403
the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance	2682.8481
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	135.5142
en route gentlemen and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris	198.4882
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address	106.3883
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament	379.8674
oh if he were minister and i were his dartagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together yes said porthos the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest	164.5714
what is this wait your reverence there is a letter you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body	114.7120
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant true said m	68.4255
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons welfare	410.5049
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness what do you say edmond i say since you command me mercédès i must die die	176.2752
his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance	104.9230
what ails you my dearest father	31.8383
this night i have had a fearful sleep	415.6293
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows	362.8599
he thought that voice more feeble than usual	86.5162
you will put yourself at the head of the first	8.8388
dartagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting	272.0425
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions	642.8549
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest	287.2030
we have undergone a great deal of fatigue remember and a little rest will do no harm i rest	260.1757
ho ho exclaimed dartagnan picking up a louis and displaying it heres a louis that smells confoundedly of straw mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gaycome along mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it	258.4018
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerfs	70.2183
then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel	4716.4727
dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success	586.8119
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor drank	198.9125
one step farther into resttwo perhaps into silence	1016.9589
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent	143.5138
and that is the only reply you make	378.8067
dart exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand	53.2749
what forthat they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whomm	242.0140
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos	122.1065
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped	61.7093
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz	191.6049
bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter	155.1378
twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was m	315.3787
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base	516.8798
the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion	377.0363
just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow	148.2634
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau	312.6868
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a wellstuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward	283.8965
i wont have dantès killedi wont and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied danglars	310.4550
laws alone swamp our small staff	3774.8877
the baroness then thought of m	110.9511
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it thank you my friend thank you unfortunately i have just breakfasted well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast dartagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us willingly said dartagnan	115.1658
escape had never once occurred to him	4.9988
la chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la trémouille i wish to speak with him this evening your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la trémouille and myself nobody by the faith of a gentleman tomorrow then sire tomorrow monsieur at what oclock please your majesty at any hour you will but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty awaken me do you think i ever sleep then	102.4898
would you like to hear the story sir yes relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history	135.0250
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees	789.6575
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majestys well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	96.7595
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of gods anger ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilians face	154.9432
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athoss hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed	212.4553
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes	3.2006
dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	375.2326
i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressingroom	69.5329
they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannonball to the feet and then threw them into the sea	199.6840
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	268.8683
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	178.0642
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	107.7974
it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday near the gate st honoré no upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman i bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name porthos	163.9492
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp	319.4789
scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun	135.7609
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitors emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone	239.3792
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa	67.6818
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing	63.9698
noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	113.1233
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk and was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of anxiety	163.1263
and now what do you want oh how extraordinary i shall complain to m	118.5329
no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne and shall we arrive there safe and sound as true as my names jack butler well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven oclock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named	162.5229
what are you waiting for said caderousse	2102.3474
there monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious presence the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired	210.2848
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you	20.5519
you are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitatingly	587.4917
at the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	181.3627
edmond found some solace in these ideas	509.4296
fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwellingplace	124.2447
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon and dartagnan dressed himself in an instant	59.3564
for the moment she wished nothing better	507.9030
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl	219.4288
it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave	160.5934
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself	226.6041
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt	145.3982
she was a most atrocious woman and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god what is the use of thinking of it all	70.6646
we can watch the skipper and if he doesnt go straight i will crush him thats all well said porthos replied dartagnan	66.9774
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his breast	176.4152
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder	180.3094
it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin	171.5621
athos said she wait a moment and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment	87.7608
who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst dartagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads	252.4058
yes i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams yes i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which cannot sleep strike save england save thyselffor thou wilt die without having appeased god speak speak cried felton i can understand you now a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady	228.7785
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance	405.2516
as the door opened the sound of a _guzla_ reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter	228.9106
then adieu valentine valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them	91.9339
going along dartagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not	130.9569
the kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism	503.5855
and she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window help help for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people help comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder fire assassins master broussel is being killed master broussel is being strangled it was friquets voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	580.8474
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to methe beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus	407.9632
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m	108.6636
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her	127.4600
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively	317.1672
in ten minutes it would strike seven	1336.8265
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrels entrance it was again opened for the count	147.8874
you will describe it to me replied franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it	118.2708
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	192.6469
good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor believe softspoken gentlemen again hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his temple	144.8728
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	83.8870
accept this halfpistole to drink to my health i do not drinkbazin pushed away with dignity the officers handtis good only for the laity incorruptible murmured dartagnan i am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him	226.2722
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy	114.8642
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship _pharaon_ this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and portoferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris	108.6194
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph this work is provided to you asis with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose	55.8605
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	157.4121
in whom can i trust place confidence in me madame do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger but i must write oh yes that is indispensable	108.4949
his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth	23.3909
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of	130.2560
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam	751.3940
m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	51.9279
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust	216.6816
well have you sent asked monte cristo seeing morrel return	105.2564
the count followed her with his eyes	29.4594
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah mon dieu my dear monsieur de rochefort do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety	140.5511
dartagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return	53.7554
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem	199.8575
in a few minutes a night watch passed	907.6741
a doctor he was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father	113.4188
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée dantin no the others are on the mantlepiece of your excellencys bedroom good what oclock is it four oclock monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerfs and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way	119.7189
it is my happiness my treasure my hope	668.9745
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	160.8108
he is reduced almost to the last extremitynay he is almost at the point of dishonor how yes continued caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m	182.4550
kitty will conduct you to my chamber the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words	151.7231
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	120.7196
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse	521.8402
for stealing for stealing you rochefort you are laughing at me i understand	91.7111
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy some i shall displease others	318.5947
he meets albert de morcerf in italyit is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he introduces himself to madame danglarsit is that he may give her a royal present your stepmother and her son pass before his doorit is that his nubian may save them from destruction	249.5178
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m	33.1353
then you shall not leave this place said he	61.9152
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass	74.7431
are you satisfied my lord he asked	54.4597
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel acknowledge that if albert is brave he cannot be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation	130.4407
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated	1964.2424
they can move their arms they can and that is much	164.8002
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian	102.9734
the _pharaon_ left calcutta the th of february she ought to have been here a month ago what is that said the englishman	40.7316
go to your father go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me shall i row you ashore no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars	298.5978
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other	31.1348
we shall see returned the other smiling	692.9263
do you hear anything said she	61.3594
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action	152.6698
this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said davrigny	138.5575
when your turn comes i shall have the honor to inform you of it	31.9843
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor villefort looked at the count almost with terror	100.9980
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers what matters it if you avoid them hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold i positively refuse intrigues terrify me	222.3133
go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you	90.1745
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position	273.2664
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness	19.4052
but where you go i go they then set off for rueil	295.4881
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks where do you come from from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost	137.1087
to what do you allude monsieur said danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals words	75.8038
you leaned upon my armupon this madame i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot	285.0855
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechals opinion in every respect the color mounted to the queens face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger	162.0934
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning	64.6060
i was promised he should die with me	55.2846
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure	170.7582
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror	184.1902
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	203.9745
why the thing has made a tremendous noise yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse m then you do not speculate ihow could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income	203.0487
what vessel is that asked milady	51.4540
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man	90.5017
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered dartagnan	35.7824
i see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life	147.3642
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison in prison said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges	212.2192
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm	140.0251
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you	185.0308
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what dartagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons dartagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom	186.6439
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty	570.7830
come in said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately beauchamp appeared	238.1625
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinals motive	189.5927
m a quarter of an hour was the reply	61.2015
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt	101.0763
the comte de la fere she cried	114.5628
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence	207.8459
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a wordhis majestys order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced	134.6552
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him	166.9038
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position	163.9109
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	54.3038
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure	201.9907
a woman with athos after all continued dartagnan there was certainly one with aramis	125.9728
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	452.5487
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès	220.0370
m saved my child said morrel what do you mean yes savedsaved see see said the young girl	79.2617
is he still in a fit said the procureur	101.4480
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself	156.7109
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champsélysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up	150.5643
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	200.7829
the counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	517.5793
de jussac turned the corner of the convent	11.2892
halloo planchet here saddle our horses take your carbine whom are we going to attack sir no one a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon	235.7067
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced	111.6553
i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question	262.2446
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	284.3859
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome with pleasure there was a cry of shut up from the audience	105.0401
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone visible	262.7598
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuablesfor as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsicacomplained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement	171.1081
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege	297.1440
he pressed the counts hand and left	71.3428
what is it said monte cristo	1.0010
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard a great misfortune m	224.6553
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the kings commissioner la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window	76.5382
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat	301.2507
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use	280.1179
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by châteauroux clermontferrand le puy and nîmes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nîmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings in the smuggling line said monte cristo	188.9296
dartagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	363.5989
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary matter	208.2156
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to ones self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it	151.2518
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminences commands and dartagnan unsealed the letter and read m	134.8603
dartagnan although he was not a musketeer performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality	261.9502
declare to belong to him alo	40101016.0000
you held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards me	208.1509
our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at tableat least i hope sotwo benefactors of humanity what shall we do said debray we have only one monthyon prize well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma and where does he come from asked debray	231.6268
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg electronic works in your possession	54.4629
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	510.3815
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself yes ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty i have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	96.8207
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room	87.4579
what is the matter sir asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner	109.5414
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice you are a born diplomat returned franz go and try meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire	203.1035
de saintméran madame de saintméran two months since the other day it was barrois today the old noirtier or young valentine you knew it cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo startedhe whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing and what is it to me replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders do i know those people	137.2288
and athos i have not yet seen him	297.8930
aramis stipulated that bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums	2104.8640
furthermore dartagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow	348.3994
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head	348.5164
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat	235.0421
to the sloop said felton and row quickly the four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it	245.2828
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	122.0451
dartagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down	166.2060
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch	342.3751
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	286.6208
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all	89.1670

it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt it is for that reason you see me so early because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me no because i passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	137.7265
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge	65.5612
de tréville was informed by dartagnan and porthos of the circumstance	97.7273
noirtier yes well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w	110.4841
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	94.1275
that is all i had to say to you and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady	260.5159
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	263.7300
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you	97.7554
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina	84.7976
let the man go dartagnan let us save the woman monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat eh monsieur eh friend said dartagnan a halfpistole for that paper my faith monsieur with great pleasure here it is the hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the yard	126.0437

_ma foi_ said monte cristo rubbing his elbow its all your servants fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass are you hurt sir coldly asked morrel	356.9555

he had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary	821.7814
does he regret me a little	38.8821
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these banknotes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot	84.7596
no you sounded me nothing more	32.3696

vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by teresa	125.7790
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès	79.2654
i wish after such a scene to be alone mazarin bent low before her	379.2549
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others _pardieu_ i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before me	228.7233
ah _parbleu_ thats good said albert with a gloomy tone	71.3204
i come for your commands my lord he said	20.2085
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak	13.5211
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo	216.9902
many young men of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared	2278.0786
you will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you dartagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception	104.2005
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details	47.2993
gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	237.4503
answer that is the very truth cried the mercer but monsieur does not tell you silence with respect to me silence with respect to my friends silence about the queen above all or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself come come gentlemen remove the fellow and dartagnan pushed the halfstupefied mercer among the guards saying to him you are a shabby old fellow my dear	180.8999
in the court are orangetrees in pots turf and clumps of flowers and no steeltraps no the stables are on either side of the gate which you see there and andrea continued his plan	251.2285
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	51.1182
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat	129.6464
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in haste	281.7702
however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor most willingly duke under your auspices i will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding	147.5004
ill manage it somehow you will see but said dartagnan now i think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight nothing at all said groslow	165.8800
with the dukes aid they already considered themselves invincible	3548.2019

dartagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight	319.1716

my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her	148.1674

at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut la carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it yes your excellency	152.5370

the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more just	267.2576
porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder	25.4649
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory	318.2502
where are we going asked he by a gesture	95.5285
tomorrow morning i start for paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent	150.6858
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel	126.0772
and so my friends we return to paris	117.5825
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else	146.8301
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude	448.9237

la houdiniere _captain of the guards_ the devil said athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other i will go to the second after attending the first said dartagnan	144.0973
oh do not deny it answer continued milady	1894.7670
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant societythose manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions	203.2568
m i have the honor i presume of addressing m	211.9541
ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks welcome cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized luigi vampa	1053.6798
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos	96.8131
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him	139.8708
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained	114.8006
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant servicea costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined	585.4907
each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth	275.1102
in the meanwhile i am a musketeer in that quality i say what i please and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me aramis porthos gentlemen gentlemen cried the surrounding group	120.7784

de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission	84.8876
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman	77.9222
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief	203.4273
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them	50.6067
it was evident he had his orders	280.9265
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me	35.5754
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected	2769.0669
and then said monte cristo this is not all what is there more said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars	51.9914
m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights	168.8354
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury	182.0506
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all what brother cried milady must i name him again	191.0987
ah is it you baron said he	21.4565

edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm	101.3427
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand	91.7524
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saintjeanauxbois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest	145.1812

the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume	661.7923

now said dartagnan for the actual man	582.2573
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter	84.9914
athos was pale and trembled in every limb	1507.2266
the steps were already down and the door open	65.0131
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead	384.1132

dear benedetto said he i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend chapter	131.0439
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing	80.0343
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	196.8015
in the first place there is a little _intrigante_ named bonacieux she is in the prison of nantes that is to say she was there replied milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent to a convent said the duke	87.5041
tomorrow morning at seven oclock you will be with me will you not we will hush the curtain is rising	262.7740
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation	1026.1077
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing dartagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained him	138.2788
look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to dartagnan the scratch he had remembered	96.4635
when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence	248.7155
he thought of that young and pretty mme	309.0308
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	79.2801
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie	662.3157
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived	147.3437
what are you looking at asked dartagnan	1146.6299
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret	96.1799
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected	158.6263
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m	123.9504
i do nothing without her commandspray understand that not like monsieur de richelieu who went on just as he pleased	325.8571
am i not to know to whom to present it you will know when you reach london at london you may tear off the outer envelope and what are my instructions to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed	139.0161
dartagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said dartagnan i decide that we should adopt athoss plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus	113.7510
they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village the redtiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an augustine brother	225.1589
m châteaurenaud was at his post apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert	417.9775
this was more than poor bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and fainted	118.9550
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate	103.6703
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate	268.0747
it must be done said athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	170.6241
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	43.0704
but hark hark there he is somebody has disturbed him without doubt said dartagnan	92.9683

you tell me said franz at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi vampa when he was a childhe is still a young man then a young man	95.2382
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations	285.6381
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see after the worthy mercer later	457.3697
these three others fenced against him with their agile swords	321.7240
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom	173.8633
i ask pardon of your eminence said dartagnan but i was so fatigued dont ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service dartagnan admired mazarins gracious manner	222.0350

dartagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her winewhich was a horrible production from the country of montreuiland heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville the other was a convent of jesuits and was the propertya by no means unusual circumstanceof these worthy fathers	186.3502
one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body	173.7570
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient	229.5541
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish to horse porthos said dartagnan taking his friend by the hand	82.9463
in fact at halfpast eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawingrooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen	221.7558
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the customhouse officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aiguesmortes	204.7335
morrel said châteaurenaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m	25.0596
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak i speak of the adventureeh you know well what i mean alas no my lord replied dartagnan surprised	125.3256
but i require three weeks preparation at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please three weeks cried albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m	160.7681
dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed	96.8867
m here is said the englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of francs to our house by m	208.8644
you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all i ask	163.5554

each examined his arms and put them in order	58.7540
bertuccioyou are going to stay in the carriage then	31.3333

oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather inviting what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago	207.7483
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a _mésalliance_	154.4389
five millionsa pretty sum eh peppino hushhere is our man the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads one was writing and the other praying when the door opened	235.5810

yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	452.5765
then dartagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful	196.6307

_moderato_ he cried as they descended	246.4325
but in what force was the enemy	176.8471
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	157.4462
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	455.9528
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of dartagnan	73.4481
what the devil would you have me do with that said the englishman	74.2850
haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawingroom	72.5948
is that all then in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory	65.3344

decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man i cover mine said dartagnan	210.6380
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance	425.6019
my sister how did your husband die horror cried porthos and aramis	69.3302

my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	149.7904

one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might	139.1916
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	165.1209
what are there no grottos at monte cristo he asked	41.0309
the count received him with his habitual smile	121.5224

one of the culprits will be _mazzolato_ he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity	255.8582
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber	282.2508

the superior met her milady showed her the cardinals order	272.8235
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sirthats agreedthat i shall find you tomorrow at charenton oh dont be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre	126.2824
the stranger was about to reply but at the moment he opened his mouth dartagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the door	59.8213
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects	751.2213
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oclock	64.9436

except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europethe english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	165.1482

and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape	228.7906
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right _animadvertuntur in desertis_ a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	176.3240
as quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was doing	81.5660

i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here an enemy cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin	88.5070
pray dartagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you	349.3237
oh i will be a match for you murmured milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monks frock by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite	283.9407
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands	87.5088
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	166.3593
here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army how do you make that out inquired athos	81.0935
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative	151.8819

this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party	176.1650
his name is said she in her turn	98.7353
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord said rochefort	42.0734
have you not slept said the jailer	60.7911
from the ends of these two wings extended the park	384.2786
one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selims flaming lance	534.3177
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction	138.9044
oh said dartagnan we dont now make war as we did formerly	315.4912
have you seen him since i left him	31.6296
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached	304.7990
de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion	210.7468
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	195.9081
it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercédès dwelt	264.8490
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel	95.9958
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me come now said athos you are joking in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair perhaps you speak the truth aramis well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	114.6742
the tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage	143.0484
young man said he to dartagnan a suggestion what you may get into trouble by what has taken place you believe so yes	161.9595
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man	41.3527
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her	133.6002
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father	88.0803

bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend	119.8262
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles did you ever see mercédès again inquired the priest	183.6991
the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help what is the matter asked monte cristo	140.8628
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder	53.0170
i am fifteen years younger than he is	53.5666
their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of dartagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders	506.2657
at halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert	312.6485
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favorgentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m	542.1045
he said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	536.1896
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	127.0096
i will denounce this place of infamy	288.5658
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting	106.9570
number and number dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense	1094.1271
now sir said the count you are safecalm yourself ah my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen and whilst dartagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer	234.9155
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference	166.2526
what is the matter then he asked	45.8102
the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès mate on board the threemaster the _pharaon_ trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to morrel son of marseilles before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines oh no monsieur he is very young how old nineteen or twenty at the most at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was m	119.7633
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp	183.1099
fortunately the reader may remember or may not rememberfortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him	111.4575
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years ah yes i understand said mazarin want of fortune perhaps	129.1445
how if there is any left murmured he	719.8782
barcelona has risen in his favor all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stockjobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow	108.0939
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them	186.1925
pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark	134.6021
an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the _lives of the saints_ to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced	137.6844
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune	181.8542
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening	102.7841
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine	117.8389
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret	94.3022
his friend do you hear that madame	159.3805
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue	472.7528
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution	434.9502
at length dartagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a womans torn glove	353.8082
believe me continued tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set out ah you are right monsieur said dartagnan but you know athos porthos and aramis and you know if i can dispose of them without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof	133.8656
danglars said another sign in the negative	416.3495
here i am dear count welcome home again i arrived an hour since from dieppe no from tréport indeed and i have come at once to see you that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference	148.7865
that can only be to hold gloves he said	488.9666
these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercédès coloring	138.5911
de tréville at a distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you	151.4720
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledgehammer	227.7179
she must have a long arm hush said porthos placing a finger on his lips	53.3283
well where is he sir asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	648.5917
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	234.8761
we therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul certainly sir replied the viscount	208.4643
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through me yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i shall lose my honor felton and it is you you whom i make responsible before god and before men for my shame and my infamy this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him	118.3476
_my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg_ good _the luxembourg_ one might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother thats ingenious said athos	513.5150
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head	324.2727
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly	253.0268
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	272.6424
that would boom the market she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually wellinformed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielles house is totally without foundation	601.3029
de saintméran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count	10.7941
i live retired in the house of my noble protector but i do it from choice	105.8089
see look at fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	253.4162
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriagewheels as he was driven rapidly away	119.9638
ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box	130.8937
well madame said de winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants	273.7533
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by dartagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution	222.4297
de tréville was not at his hôtel	143.1868
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible	152.9355
i shall hear from you yes thanks thanks dear love adieu the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue	227.4195
and what have i to do with your illhumor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these things concern me	115.3325
i learn all in the silence of my apartmentsfor instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote m then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingshe is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done	134.0760
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept	102.2304
it seems his former master accustomed him to that well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the kings health mazarin was large in promisesquite unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so bepraised by la ramee for he said nothing and did much	203.1192
on the twentyeighth of october the capitulation was signed	882.4907
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply i am a priest said the young man	37.2446
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your boarders said milady oh my god poor woman i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	110.1773
is he then advancing on paris the minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal	336.3691
did he speak in your hearing	53367.3516
dartagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read dec	377.3410
it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the hôtel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns	64.1261
i received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact i rendered him	169.5147
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips	967.6854
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	407.8539
lord winter is killed then inquired dartagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse	43.0034
you have hastened to mecan i have the happiness of being useful to you m yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me tell me what it is replied monte cristo	101.7331
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh	256.7041
the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him	821.8120
this is a kind of usury banker that i do not understand take all thentake all i tell you and kill me come come calm yourself	356.1101
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick	173.8276
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	128.2081

this door was a mockery to the _concierge_ from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_ opening at the _sesame_ of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	431.8371
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter	117.3813

you know one cannot change his nature he said	68.0366
morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless	887.8519
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse	965.2461
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged	60.0120
in the proper time and place i will remember everything	154.7115
this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead	501.1768
as to getting him drunk the duke couldnt hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it	87.2070
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but dartagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down tonight upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur dartagnan to the end of the world	114.3623
when he came here monsieur dartagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order i suppose to have his sword back	186.1035
but go a little way from francego either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streetspeople erect smiling and freshcolored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago he will be a dead man in a month then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous _aqua tofana_ that they said was lost at perugia ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything	248.5949
the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen	62.3811
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am	144.1023
in fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the louvre no one appeared to be aware that charles i	94.3604
with my usual fatuity i doubted it now i am convinced	71.6580
she lived in the place royalethen the fashionable quarterat number and he undertook to call and take dartagnan with him in order to introduce him	249.6759
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine	165.2289
de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair	167.8244
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead	299.1308
she sighed as she looked at him	5.5307
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydées countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request oh it is nothing said monte cristo	143.4794
well said she if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment	151.4522
mademoiselle darmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the germans are so fond	531.6514

the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village	170.5476

the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	53.9210
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	91.5106
ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening	195.3430
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the kings attorney you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m	83.1650
dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegrinder	185.3128
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugénie hold your tongue the men are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest themi despise them what shall we do asked louise	230.2293
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stonework	273.3689
all the crowd gave way before morrel	174.8353
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend	127.6306
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	400.5852
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper silence exclaimed dantès	199.5461
those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of coral	223.5212
when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath then fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last deathrattle and expired	227.1583
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree	154.8857
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de châteaurenaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saintméran despised all who were not noble	142.7117
i am from gascony it is true and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel	99.6955
and a little bit of a thief oh sir oh and more especially a notorious coward oh oh sir you really vilify me cried olivain	538.2088
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog	194.2821
there edmond dantès he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentines room of which he doublelocked the door	107.4446
do you think of dying my lord said she	44.2476
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs you guess well i know something of diamonds i have had some you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	193.3469
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving	264.2304
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian oh i shall always love you	120.1865
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinals arm	209.4957
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell and are you going to leave me at such a time this very instant and where are you going ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service ah me ah me have you any letters for me inquired dartagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief	111.0400
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the kings bed ready to die for him laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst dartagnan glided behind the curtains	105.3045
dartagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it	14.8704
de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush it is probable sire replied villefort	136.6912
it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear	883.5854
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose	54.0460
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	40.9836
and why ah very well said dartagnan i see that you understand french	26.2725
the inspector kept his word with dantès he examined the register and found the following note concerning him _edmond dantès_ violent bonapartist took an active part in the return from elba	527.6756
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists if he persists said the cardinal	76.9717
but then you yourself are known to others yes i am known so that proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti so that you will remit to me these francs certainly at your first request the majors eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment	209.8970
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture really this is frightful stop a minute you dont know all yet	265.6782
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong	71.0425
i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday did you fear that we should forget it you are very good madame but m	59.2259
i have pursued it for six years only and previously where were you in the bastile and before you went to the bastile i will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my confession good at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice	80.1805
impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver how is that mousqueton	219.3192
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this houseyes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice	174.0879
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him	103.8509
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only two yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos	122.5712
god grant you as much let us drink then she is dead stammered dartagnan	123.1182
and madame de saintméran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixirthree drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m	286.6111
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me	127.8128
at first they saw nothing around them	146.4360
no i am lost do not be lost with me	26.7133
m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht	350.2940
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved mea heart like yours felton a man like you	207.9834
bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully	34115.3867
although dartagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words	438.8694
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus	186.4599
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark	181.4554
we left paris each with seventyfive pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure i think not monsieur unless something new should happen well a pleasant journey thanks monsieur dartagnan left m	173.0944
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thingbeing too severe with the prisoners and who is this cerberus a certain monsieur grimaud my lord and what was he before he went to vincennes he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me and who recommended this man to you the steward of the duc de grammont he is not a gossip i hope lord a mercy my lord i thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs	99.8303
signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests	102.4426
had old æolus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the _moccoli_ and aquilo the heirpresumptive to the throne	207.6360
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead	51.5661
dartagnan does not tell you raoul said athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his timea knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire thats what his adversary met with	232.1654
ho ho what are the wishes of his eminence he wishes to have you in his service and who spoke to him of me rochefortyou remember him yes pardieu it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much you gave him three swordwounds in three separate engagements but you know he is now our friend no i didnt know that	112.4971
well never mind that neighbor caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that	63.5831
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times i shall do so if only in gratitude eh cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder	594.5731
ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart hum said the major	50.7011
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	210.9937
i know what i am saying continued the marchioness i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage	171.9594
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m	125.9392
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept	107.3410
then said albert you became the property of this man m no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slavemerchants who were going to constantinople	109.3655
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse	177.7008
she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes	188.2287
a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand	38.6175
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her _lorgnette_ at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron drew a smile to franzs countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him	124.1612
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced	27.7414
she belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier	170.2364
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us	145.6168
they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst	602.9315
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe	1856.3982
come milady opened the window and made a sign to mme	15.4402
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object	194.9554
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared	141.9007
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself hear me count replied dartagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur dherblay	188.8407
oh those figures how well i remember them i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free	72.1319
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her	88.0315
well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked debray of the sergeantatarms slipping a louis into his hand	192.3094
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children	200.2388
thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disobeyed baptistin bowed	178.0810
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow	277.4519
he was not however a good sleeper	16608.3340
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders and good old penelon making signals to m	316.5539
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so	80.8565
good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name	175.9077
on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock	146.4066
i will write to him then nearly in these terms let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look	238.7673
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	144.3004
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	116.6585
no no like shakespeares polonius he died for another	120.7635
you have committed a piece of folly said athos but it cant be helped there is no drawing back	212.4740
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	3859.5229
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps	162.2490
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in	140.1311
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing	117.7054
he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find paris tranquil	60.3701
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saintgermain	401.4897
he rose to return the salutation	582358.3750
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	116.1474
and now once more adieu said morrel	82.0974
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it	74.0022
so he cherishes no resentment you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	10.9686
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep	473.5244
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at dartagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfellowship	124.6595
progress of cavalcanti the younger chapter	2457.0623
the maid approached planchet whom she took for lubin and holding out a little billet to him said for your master for my master replied planchet astonished	106.8730
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart	140.8674
i am not mistaken dartagnan cried rochefort	269.6439
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you	63.6830
ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind dartagnan in generosity i would give as much as a hundred pistoles the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates	250.1528
has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep	159.8878
i recognized your name in it	127.8064
dartagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly	96.9572
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary	121.1224
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to enter	376.8004
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals	757.1800
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me	176.3539
thats a snare said athos dont go dartagnan and yet replied dartagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos	139.2831
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours monte cristo shrugged his shoulders	79.4290
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison	170.2294
on being left alone with mme	563.5146
he shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream	91.8183
everyone therefore ran to the court some to witness the sight others to comment upon it	4800.9414
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	760.4687
the count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest	3163.0554
well then asked athos in a low tone	12.9879
it was then observable that the substance was greenish	596.7536
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule	133.5806
fight the more for duels being forbidden since consequently there is twice as much courage in fighting	327.6139
mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled by whom by the joices the prinns the cromwells by a tailor a coachmaker a brewer ah i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ah what is he himself asked madame henrietta	273.1824
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened what is the matter sire exclaimed lord leven	65.6728
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only châteaurenaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	120.5300
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly	103.9816
thanks madame said porthos but i dont like to abuse your kindness besides i must think of my outfit thats true said the procurators wife groaning that unfortunate outfit alas yes said porthos it is so but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos oh of many things said porthos	119.9247
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned youis that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	112.8023
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity	1212.1611
i have extricated you from misery felton i have caused you to be named lieutenant i once saved your life you know on what occasion	143.8152
morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence thats right thats right dantès i see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer	164.9814
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths	226.6902
bonacieux was the very life of dartagnan	20.7831
le baron franz dépinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders	28.5158
or a tiger ali bowed his head in token of assent	47.3522
groslow said aramis the devil who is this groslow asked porthos	159.8133
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent in his convent what convent	171.1157
between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped here	161.7822
the bolt gave way and the door opened	15.4135
the count had just opened a door	20.3898
upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds	2608.2346
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand	109.8809
life is full of humiliations and sorrows continued he becoming still more melancholy all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man particularly the golden ties	226.7055
yes my lord well let us set out how many men does your eminence wish to escort you you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight as many as my lord wishes i will follow you	112.5065
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace	352.9675
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir	174.5366
i have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times	1426.4502
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper	221.5101

you see it is a serious annoyance said morcerf when beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph	255.1783
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes	28.2266
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more	217.9252
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse	243.2348
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	103.2363
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence	69.4176
dartagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	162.9001
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them	37.5314
to present our respects to the cardinal porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed dartagnan	139.2688
albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert	252.7632
if so speak out answered athos	25.6114
do you know him aramis as well as you do gentlemen for i was among those who seized him in the garden at amiens into which monsieur putange the queens equerry introduced me	158.4591
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused	170.8930
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	105.6132
and now gentlemen i wish you goodmorning said monte cristo	378.9875
de morcerf so early had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general	107.8564
wholly yours aramis dartagnan tried to recall his remembrances	80.2676
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest searchsearch but what have i done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you	146.5476
he waited then in the antechamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them	106.4999
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen	86.0901
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful	150.6599
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water	202.5925
and that you should fail me dartagnan passed a very bad night	178.4190
ah madame cried debray what is the matter with you	23.8883
there is no knighterrant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady i detain a prisoner but i have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of lord de winter my brother	154.9968
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands	131.1779
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet time	163.3204
bertuccio said the count severely i ordered dinner at that hour and i do not like to wait and he returned to his guests while bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the diningroom	79.0075
do you permit us to open this casket asked the notary	239.6319
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light	79.3553
the answer known he had yielded to alberts wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydées recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerfs father	159.7899
dartagnan said athos taking his hand you know i love you if i had a son i could not love him better	50.3741
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but today is not the proper time today flatter and caress or you are only a common woman at the first words of this address dartagnan had seized porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	150.2764
as you please he said death is always deaththat is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him	251.9566
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de larbresec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	118.5216
what blows what blood he fainted	2359.1440
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit	123.9282
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow fortunately said dartagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you	142.6992
you are free you leave the counts house and you take your mother to your home but reflect albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her	204.2537
has he built one here then no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise both the deuceand what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	185.8780
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	100.9216
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the counts lips	218.8853
but dartagnan again shook his head	2.7986
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so	128.2034
porthos paid his compliments to m	107.7312
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends dear dartagnan oh how he will thank you i hope so	75.5321
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bellrope rang with all her strength	234.1129
kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women	95.6047
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	103.5830
here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following	710.4340
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	303.7382
i will continue then resumed aramis	72.8025
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was	119.1798
alberts lips scarcely whispered goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	684.0903
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villeforts face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also	154.8172
noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild	303.7619
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison	169.4645
noirtier watched her with evident anguish	4604.3345
i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis	81.1950
i am well i want nothing do not call him she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room	184.5152
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was necessary	484.1510
we are carrying too much canvas	26848.2539
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword	59.2380
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me	137.3921
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling then addressing dartagnan you know the watchword he said	119.2056
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to france for a thousand pistoles said the captain	55.5440
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor	216.5213
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friends susceptibility	213.5017
de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	82.9480
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away that was true ah i see that nobleman was you it was his father hush do not speak so loud madame he is there he is there my son the son of marie michon but i must see him instantly take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother you have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy	110.6995
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket the casket would encumber you	270.0585
i always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased minds	1222.6730
but therenow take himhe is your own for as long as you like	58.1706
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m	83.8373
debraydo i wish to know himdo i wish to know that he gives advicedo i wish to follow itdo i speculate	437.3671
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they eat	197.5399
at least you dont speak well of him that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim but this letter in which he recommends you to me is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites but why have you not fled whither should i go	103.9279
after a moments interval cocles appeared	180.9095
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched	189.8473
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	1157.2603
the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body	134.4643
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do	90.3805
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	417.9119
you have continued your course of villany you have robbedyou have assassinated well i should say if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble	246.3877
he hastened to open the _secrétaire_ and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of credit	137.1239
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling	69.9485
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	78.7456
look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the wall	122.8900
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastionsomething he had till then doubtedhe pulled his master by the skirt of his coat	164.0918
of the interval passed nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees mountains and landscapes are lost	436.1947
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	106.0959
yes shall i give these papers to m	53.7311
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd	219.3183
should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abbé busoni send for me if i am still on earth and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily	346.5168
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey	140.7656
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter	100.2841
dartagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal	113.0785
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir	267.8894
well you are right it is more difficult than i thought	47.0551
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawingroom	76.1310
dépinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m	140.2249
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	228.4782
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk openworked stockings passed a white and tolerably nicelooking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	327.7842
my lord excuse me i speak as i can i restrain myself	158.9979
we shall be safer there than in the doorway ah my god whispered mme	183.7110
villefort fully understood his fathers meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders	137.2272
what the devil are you doing by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos	571.0847
one hours rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young mans bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedoma pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependenceseemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future	471.9026
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majestys service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me	131.9852
my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered	140.9079
pay and eat and what am i to pay with brute said danglars enraged	272.6115
dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added halfmast the colors and square the yards you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word and so in fact he is said the owner	139.4131
i am the friend of the great cardinal of the great cardinal perhaps you would contest his right to that title madame i would contest nothing but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister	127.4220
you do not understand me gentlemen said dartagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun	105.7005
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench he cried	107.6603
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	277.9355
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you	99.3845
come come said dartagnan more reason why we should start on our journey	128.3046
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	324.5386
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	121.0117
the count said a word in arabic to ali and the horses went on at great speed	170.7415
for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the fatherinlaw of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key doublelocks his coffer and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will want a crown an el dorado and potosí no these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families like jupiter they like to cross the race	369.8972
then remarking the strange expression of miladys countenance she said pardon me madame you know him by what title why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of friend you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress it is you who have been his mistress madame cried milady in her turn	91.9405
i insult you said lord de winter with contempt	30.8505
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	2666.5894
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny	194.4297
a tigress a panther ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us dartagnan then related allthe mad passion of milady and her menaces of death	217.6512
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying	55.7824
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knowswell they feast on the vulture	2969.9211
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks for forms sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day	132.9823
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head	180.6594
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask assistance	383.8177
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the evening	13.8642
dartagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had notwhatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subjectbeen able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence	776.5807
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your plan well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs	123.7223
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph project gutenberg is a registered trademark	43.7845
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse	21.7414
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men	139.6717
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twentythree years of age said athos in a low tone	164.9258
well then to my health although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his hands then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes	134.5264
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces	99.2614
the first prince of the blood the kings uncle no not the first prince of the blood not the kings uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the bloodnot the prince nearest to the throne not the kings uncle i repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinqmars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversaryinstead of a man who threatened a man who smiles	163.7118
mans whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them	303.4413
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur demery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity	222.5105
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine willingly said albert but let us walk	95.6393
get up he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos	114.0319
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons	169.2860
will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence	172.7516
bertuccio no excellency i do not recollect telling you that i thought you did i must have been mistaken no you were not for it was in reality a little boy	86.0008
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him	208.0964
had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct that is reasonable since he is an only son well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten	197.9251
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions	358.4785
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity do not run down m	109.0691
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing	235.2086
you will speak in italian said he	25.4455
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor	293.0695
admirable and dogmatic repeated the curate who about as strong as dartagnan with respect to latin carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him and repeated his words like an echo	203.9699
de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history	143.8387
unfortunately edmonds brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular	127.9306
davrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death	87.3496
the man was an enigma to franz	27.3787
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others she must die therefore i warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everythingthis murder which has deprived me of my namethis murder which has impoverished methis murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacablei shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when i discover them with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward de winter	222.4032
ah thats it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony we are going to fetch our brevets said dartagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them and where are we going asked porthos	126.2021
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder	190.0072
the queen looked at him surprised	3232.0891
you know he has estatesporthos i should think so indeed	26.8104
athos in his hours of gloomand these hours were frequentwas extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness	357.5630
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	148.0129
he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment	556.7705
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric	97.6846
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you ah said buckingham god be praised my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger laporte burst into tears	97.1786
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said	44.8831
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin i hope so and when will the dance begin the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow morning you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier dhumieres has promised me whenever i need them upon fifty soldiers yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them good my dear rochefort but that is not all	151.2243
here is the relic she said do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor my child said monte cristo coloring allow me to take back that purse	69.6936
how do you think these garments fit me wonderfully said dartagnan but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better what asked porthos	140.7929
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	111.0809
de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	112.8651
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist	476.8293
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel	106.3366
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside	330.1951
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	142.8944
the _moccoli_ or _moccoletti_ are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple withfirst how to keep his own _moccoletto_ alight and secondly how to extinguish the _moccoletti_ of others	338.4243
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian	233.9087
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of	202.9963
the pavilion at nine oclock dartagnan was at the hôtel des gardes he found planchet all ready	72.1691
here is a letter i have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over	111.2958
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught	303.3521
ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize halloo halloo friends to horse to horse several horsemen ran quickly to him	459.7893

and when did he set out yesterday evening planchet my friend interrupted dartagnan you are really a precious fellow you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone	89.6529
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madamethanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated	282.6639
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of braccianos but also return to florence alone if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least	111.7737
come let us speak of your little affairs	192.4312
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face	107.6502
i imitate neither manfred nor anthony but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing soi repeat it you are right but in losing you i lose my life	240.9696
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france take care athos cried dartagnan dont you see they are aiming yes yes said athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him	150.8200
he was armed at all points	4326.9893
i beg your excellencys pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating manner for venturing to observe that it is already two oclock i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly	105.1565
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power one thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athosthe best friend of dartagnan	176.0077
violence he said to himself would spoil all dartagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt	139.5390
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting	137.5783
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day	162.6621
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach	801.0253
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment	270.7622
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de larbresec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	241.4235
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him	334.8865
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	301.9284
with one word you have crushed it and i die but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your sons blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart	126.4620
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound	90.1239
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller	284.5640
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning bernouin came to arouse him his first words were well whats the matter	222.1790
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return	143.8377
do you think of him yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans what are you saying	241.4792
fifty thousand francs a year said porthos	51.8383
oh i cannot behold this frightful spectacle said he	165.8022
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly	109.6624
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in dartagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected	258.5171
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heartbroken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head	182.9958
open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk no reply	345.9685
the woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered handkerchief who told you there was a woman here replied aramis becoming as pale as death	83.0504
everything is ready is it not yes the cargo on board yes five full casks and fifty empty ones good we are carrying port wine to anvers excellent	1090.3085
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculationodious as all his calculations were	132.9338
the return dartagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation	146.0970
morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve	47.4061
have you provided yourself with money	206.7955
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask	94.4340
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a _priedieu_ all its furniture	631.5363
de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be what does he appear to be why you have just saida man of high distinction i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such but what is your own opinion albert i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese i do not ask you of his origin but what he is ah what he is that is quite another thing	93.5462
then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer but what are your intentions mercédès smiled sadly	415.8652
two hours passed thus madame de saintméran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	101.0015
parry bent over his masters hand and kissed it respectfully	55.4179
no one knows what there is and where is it on the first floor sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy that is very simple andrea took the pen	101.8331
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where dartagnan was waiting	71.3723
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world	129.1141
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature	1205.3823
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeplyregretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head	223.7261
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince	22.5648
well after all said dartagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such	93.6152
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect	62.6142
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	121.0554
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues	128.1756
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass	83.3980
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand which whichever you pleasethere to the left here sire i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right i mean on my leftyes there	164.7645
danglars threw himself upon his goatskin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon	715.4125
no this is his blood where were you then where you left meunder the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all	187.7875
de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of moneya thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready witin default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto _fidelis et fortis_	575.8877
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	206.2616
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	142.0262
is that she mamma asked eugénie almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair yes said madame danglars that is she	189.1289
he perceived châteaurenaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeantatarms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done	73.1800
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	87.5780
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture	111.1854
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows	304.3269
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god a mournful sob burst from villeforts heart he approached the doctor and seizing his armvalentine said he it is valentines turn m your daughter cried davrigny with grief and surprise	171.1503
i dont care to be shot in a box no said aramis he has not seen us	70.3637
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms	33.7171
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	189.2276
will that do capitally replied m	91.6377
the angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church and what did the count do the count was of the highest nobility	153.6997
he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when dartagnan returned	148.1415
explain it athos groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself dartagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	829.7209
i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but despisedof a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do but who then was this man asked felton	116.5927
are you on the ground asked dartagnan	72.3411
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague	731.9922
the cousin was received with resignation that was all	122.1117
well then gowait for me there and i will soon join you you leave me then yes i also have a pious visit to pay morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city	93.1051
m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	554.8892
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming	214.2865
no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of anyones	383.4370
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know i fight in the cause of honor ah that is something serious so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service what is it to be my second that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home	91.8524
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages	199.5194
she should have wanted nothing have you ever seen the queen of england inquired dartagnan	59.4392
look at my eyes and you will see what no lookingglass has ever shown youa frank and honorable countenance to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of dartagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponents attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with dartagnan	339.6346
on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well	89.7715
there came in moreover two drafts which m	1731.5188
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript yes yes repeated the major yesthereisapostscript in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of francs which you still owe me the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	179.4949
by the governors orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath to the dungeon then said the corporal	295.9988
and you porthos i agree to it too said porthos if dartagnan approves of it	118.4541
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakenedif conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if a conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of courage	363.4700
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantèsthe worthy dantèslook here and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor	216.1108
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here	245.9233
you have some in the house have you not yes send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic villefort immediately despatched a messenger	1346.8508
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte	57.1688
he told melet me thinkwhat was it	9.0245
the scheme goes forward it seems on wheels dear friend good what shall i do now nothing it is finished then no not yet i should like to understand said porthos	124.0988
suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a carriage appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable horses while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed	522.9537
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	503.8711
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicionabove all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again	223.9426
i beg you to return me that dispatch dartagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact	410.0968
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	34.5134
i am a man of order sir let us do things in order nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you i command here ah sir said dartagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us	104.1962
monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence prudence monsieur is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers i know but indispensable to churchmen and as i am only a musketeer provisionally i hold it good to be prudent	254.1363
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted	184.3607
in fifteen or twenty days i shall set out for la rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which i shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south	102.0948
porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine	727.6884
jussac fell like a dead mass	3234.7656
when the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experienceit became necessary i say to come to the conclusion of the affair that is to say to search the queen herself	185.3934
well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond	135.8210
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep	176.8563
in fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	914.9462
dantès was beside himself with joy	70.8847
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love	141.7895
i wish to tell him to make my child happy i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey mein fact i will know himi will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty madame said villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness	158.0899
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux	129.1814
come come murmured dartagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort	116.1297
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m	173.4388
dont think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no its only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you come step in said the young man	146.8342
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that	95.8982
i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths	282.7228
oh if that were so i should lose my reason and he folded her in his arms	76.3973
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	195.5143
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions	996.9929
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge	1233.0742
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	200.6521
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race	351.6206
one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges	162.9195
at one end was the receipted bill for the francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment _julies dowry_	439.1932
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards	147.6479
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ the abbé shrugged his shoulders	108.0362
suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture	668.1478
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself	362.3121
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landingplace on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter	95.8701
be calm exclaimed athos for heavens sake have we ceased to be men no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew de winter only replied by a groan	146.8745
i will summon him hither it is useless he would not come up to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner	86.7988
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors	129.6009
i respect old age but i dont much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt	182.9737
it was a melancholy sightthat of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement	448.6956
i will show you the way and he went in first	127.2663
cavalcanti to him andrea no bartolomeo his father now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly what is it sir do you know with what design m	102.6309
did not the messenger say your fathers safety depended upon it but what danger threatens him then emmanuel she asked	247.1842
we are for the king and the princes added athos	72.8471
thats true said he quietly for my part i have never loved acknowledge then you stony heart said dartagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts tender hearts pierced hearts said athos	207.6082
what are your excellencys orders inquired gaetano	459.6137
at length the reading of the indictment was ended	700.7543
i shrink before nothing but impossibilities nothing is impossible replied milady to true love nothing madame nothing replied milady	394.0580
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them and you were wrong madame	91.9282
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution	124.4889
what do you desire a bed my lord replied dartagnan	53.0800
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender	214.4769
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	65.6185
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention	386.1992
say to her peace or war my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	156.1859
there goes one cried athos at the end of five hundred paces	18.8997
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by dartagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villarscotterets	88.5254
let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit monsieur dartagnan will enjoy our conversation better yes replied dartagnan i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon dartagnan a look full of gratitude	145.2394
as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master	137.0551
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos	71.3166
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man	354.0103
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	102.5356
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud	128.2046
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his cry	201.6294
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a _carte blanche_ by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is dartagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean	206.0182
it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room	155.1922
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend	31.8235
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond	213.2284
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir	62.3425
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos	98.8269
resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day dartagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast	96.7491
if it were so with m	103.7572
shall i call on him as i pass davrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman	131.8101
well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause deathso pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars	194.6560
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive ah monsieur and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage ah monsieur planchet began to weep	286.8281
mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations	132.5609
nothing nothing only shut the window	40.0874
de villefort what cried monte cristo it was m	23.3738
the next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at st valery	77.1141
then he pointed to the door	389.6224
do you then love mercédès i adore her for long as long as i have known heralways and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition i did not think that was the way of your people what would you have me do said fernand	125.1828
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed	67.6241
save me oh no said he but help me to die if you can are you a priest asked raoul	168.4261
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris	175.7438
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it	192.3633

if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew	90.6018

no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous the blush of pride mounted to the counts forehead as this thought passed through his mind	255.4357
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	219.1793
and now my good friend said dartagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man dartagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets	89.7965
de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letterdonned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to no in the avenue des champsélysées	208.2125

yes my lord apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier dherblay now the abbé dherblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled	122.8636
then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me oh the voice of nature said monte cristo	98.2414
guard the prisoners well i beg of you the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and dartagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	52.9696
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another	97.8267
as for you although we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field valentine colored	374.9217
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	25.7118
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshals staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur	153.5659
the count de rochefort grimaud nodded the third time	112.8299
it is well madame i believe your oath no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read i command you for i am resolved that everything shall be finished tonight and never will i recur to this subject again	268.0140
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both	116.7308
come come continued the count i see you are still the samean assassin reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not iit was la carconte that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there no reverend sir i have been liberated by someone that someone has done society a great kindness ah said caderousse i had promised and you are breaking your promise interrupted monte cristo	150.8657
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table yes monsieur that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it deposited with the justice they said it was bad money very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of	187.4858
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow voice	125.2434
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	169.4695
but where is franz in the first carriage with m	78.5861
yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter	56.7328
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appearthanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged citythe blockade might last a long time yet	429.7046
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house	110.7156

the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board _la jeune amélie_ having expired dantès took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further	199.0294
when arrived there the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all	306.9527
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand	163.8891
well said athos dont you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question	61.3804
in a moment they were at the canebière	614.4082
valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husbands arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow	486.2472
my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct	149.7394
the brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with miladys favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet	135.6978
de villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible	93.5239
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	400.4539
an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation	332.6141
notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain villefort rose as he perceived her	125.6122
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	57.0566
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep	161.7548
instinctively fernand drew back his chair	155.3527
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality	97.5066
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida	293.0815
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no oneso much the worse that has naturally led me to love no oneso much the betternow you have my profession of faith then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal lovethen mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin your ruin	289.5720

she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been discovered	311.0169
ah it is no then yes valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns	209.8499
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table	74.8736
porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar	173.8309
he was on villeforts premiseshad arrived there by scaling the wall	758.8340
no nolook look m the recommendation was needless	559.1149
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us youre right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	125.9708
at this moment a patrol passed by	106.9696

villefort burst it open with a violent blow	178.0336
heyday cried dartagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken	64.4605
then turning toward the second musketeer dartagnan said monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready	115.4389
now madame danglars feared eugénies sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle darmilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debrayan expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers	392.4216
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	166.1431
the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	123.1609
here am i milady here am i cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress	171.7951
go away now mouston so hes called mouston thought dartagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	309.7749
debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them as debray walked towards the window danglars approached his wife	128.6406
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend	146.7989
but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter	109.1942
how my fault yes i offered you escape by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door certainly porthos men like us cant go out from here purely and simply faith said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much dartagnan shrugged his shoulders	147.7789
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo	97.1801
tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of anteroom	77.2832
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a particolored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue	436.2465
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yesyes poor captain leclere he was a brave and an honest man and a firstrate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars	141.6484

i am not allowed to see you madame but you shall every day hear of me	397.3009
i have nothing to do with these thingswhy hold me responsible yes said porthos	417.4240
he was masked likewise but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity	272.2845
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg electronic works to protect the project gutenberg concept and trademark	20.6398
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity	656.6058
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	75.8007
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	394.7247
ah ah have you finished grimaud grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes	162.9516

but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in parisamongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just nowit was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place	159.0556
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven oclock	107.5229

we should command an annuity of livres	187.0776
i have placed reliance upon you my friend	29.5922
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privationhe was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness	220.8791
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune	110.8154
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	272.9475
i was wrong then no i said what you saythere is a crisis at hand	386.5944
well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon	174.1405

but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous in what respect are they capable of attempting violence dartagnan burst out laughing at the idea	136.3742
_dentro la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing accent	133.8633

oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with provisions this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety	634.6980
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long squareheaded nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another	381.7557
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel mockery muttered athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted	190.7360

felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	113.7588
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down	419.4712
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the louvre	139.9792
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you	529.9556

when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle dartagnan said athos reproachfully	251.9828
three of the four horses had already arrived	136.4767
if i were a monk i should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst yes added planchet like the famous ass of buridan	341.1371

mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother	131.6889
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order	56.8273
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and dartagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever	163.2503
where am i and why am i here	261.5686
dartagnan saw that the moment was come	63.2953

threequarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him	129.9988

where are you going oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	184.9144
with such a _vade mecum_ dartagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait	507.9977
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	999.7469
the perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint	48.0281

shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a bankers wife should exercise in providing for the future	113.0828
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window	38.0292
towards the evening of the third day	236.5828
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself yes sir then you have seen him certainly i have where	51.7211
you are right sir said athos	16.3156
de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	50.6050
oh man manrace of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to diehe shall diei will not die alone look look cried the count seizing the young mens hands look for on my soul it is curious	184.9675
signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia	5736.5239
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation	64.9741
on entering the room noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room	55.0232
with what ideas does that letter inspire you oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that m	130.4158
will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it elsewhere the count found everything he requiredsmellingbottles cigars knickknacks	517.6701
beware of a profane taste in your theological style	402.1878
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	138.5109
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled	155.5231
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish ityou are inflexible	357.9014
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now i have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true executioner	139.6277
the old mans declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m	185.7709
as to the key it had disappeared	44.4536
suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	148.2354
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags	332.0495
_non inutile desiderium oblatione_ go to the devil with your latin	37.8350
gone said morrel goneadieu my friendadieu my father gone murmured valentine adieu my sweet haydéeadieu my sister who can say whether we shall ever see them again said morrel with tearful eyes	446.5122
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized	110.8582
all this showed dartagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this veil	156.9575
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation	110.7911
ah then you wish to ask advice of me yes i do wish to ask your advice said madame danglars with anxious expectation	182.9853
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him	449.7188
the company looked at each other in consternation	202.0418
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	554.8657
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwiseif he treated me diplomaticallythat is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupantshe would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever	181.1801
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini	163.9912
and he had five millions in your hands alone why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob indeed i do not know what he is he has three unlimited creditsone on me one on rothschild one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of francs m	162.8104
aha said groslow on account of political opinions	343.2667
should your hand still be too weak to use this sword raoul so much the better	233.9089
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year of the hegira	84.7140
my dear mistress turquaine said the gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors dont pay them why prithee asked madeleine	239.0058
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen _entrées_	3527.8931
ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him	149.0572
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it	53.3667
athos and aramis walked down toward the port	62.6822
every evening he shuts himself in there	287.4928
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do that is it replied the cardinal dryly	58.3116
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed	240.7060
what you dont know me no monseigneur well two words will refresh your memory	421.0029
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had	223.2077
at the third knock however steps were heard inside	3783.5305
nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind	681.5699
that is my condemnation thought dartagnan he will spare me the _ennui_ of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial	80.2414
but make hastei cannot stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	339.8674
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works	65.8411
the nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count	180.4966
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	154.9124
stop stop cried he regaining strength by force of terror	456.6530
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semicircle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity	246.4745
allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to do you are right monsieur it is not with you that i have anything to do it is with madame with madame you do not know her replied the stranger	51.9451
come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army	205.4742
you are almost a boy i see that you require someone to answer for me i admit that would reassure me greatly do you know athos no porthos no aramis no who are these gentleman three of the kings musketeers	114.7340
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us his voice went to my heart observed julie and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before chapter	118.9747
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes	95.2186
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	351.9205
as to athos he remained unmoved	166810.7656
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues	339.7294
danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of banknotes	289.5272
dartagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly	247.5882
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent	69.9564
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled	160.3730
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of planchet faded away	203.1970
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée	145.0687
cavalcanti something of the state of your finances _ma foi_ monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord do you hear what he says major certainly i do but do you understand i do your son says he requires money well what would you have me do said the major	143.0049
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills	456.4013
yes my lord replied the servant m	396.8270
besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	368.6625
besides porthos cannot owe you much how not much twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the doctor	782.0433
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it tell it me sir formerly said the count i was athos madame de chevreuse looked astonished	143.8483
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from dartagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said dartagnan who will attend you in your campaigns why replied porthos mouston of course this was a blow to dartagnan	70.8709
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her	47.6369
sit down and let us talk it over milady murmured athos	134.5518
a gascon a match for cupid the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by dartagnan at last arrived	384.8425
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais that is all i wished to know said the queen	59.0227
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once	180.7065
in the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone	242.1131
she knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by buckinghamand buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in questiononce this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors	300.8387
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewherehave i not obeyed	222.1252
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness	147.8690
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends	347.1863
he called for me at seven oclock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the doorkeepers to place me in a box	98.6160
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron what is monsieur voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore what is the matter with him he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die is he then so ill dear voiture asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain	140.3986
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said davrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation	498.5861
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet	232.1556
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brotherinlaw monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties	63.2303
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon you are adorable madame but do not keep raoul with you why not because he is in love he he is quite a child and tis a child he loves athos became thoughtful	201.7446
grimaud my good grimaud exclaimed raoul here you are at last excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend	119.3519
it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house was in attendance	133.3721
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart	163.9976
but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me francs per month	243.5750
if you have two coats you will give me one of them	15.4880
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him	138.3360
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose	160.8693
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i cannot explain to you	44.9745
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four	120.3730
there on turning round dartagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared	79.0023
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of livres	151.3516
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man	102.2475
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started	94.5316
they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain	184.3709
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeeda very probable thing by the byin gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper pack	464.1062
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville	120.4504
well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesi cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	360.9872
in a couple of hours he returned	264.3019
as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	154.5095
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness yes said the old man	105.8445
it is not for nothing that i am styled louis the just and he signed emerys appointment	1064.1414
de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police exactly sir one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	78.9150
i see they kept their promise no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends	125.2062
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment	377.7864
i bought it from him but it belongs to dartagnan	42.1356
julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs that completes the francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains	207.9683
it was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of september	177.5494
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age	446.1082
and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded marketplace my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret	74.5794
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you	303.2144
you are about to see said mousqueton looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold	112.1379
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant	157.3833
sinbad the sailor humph said the major very good	66.8531
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke	29.9099
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme	148.4375
oh this is torture to me cried athos	49.0069
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twentyfour hours dartagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility	116.5786
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume	194.0172
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host	257.0056
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses	51.9660
in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love	103.4132
de tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was passing	51.8589
covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help	185.0258
i swear to you i protest oh but god is above god will punish you my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer upon the gospel said dartagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures	112.1109
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name	94.3170
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that dartagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage	95.8899
come hither and let us talk the host approached with hesitation	771.2158
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud dartagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar	265.2080
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	128.4818
the _cicerone_ reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman	25.3161
nevertheless dartagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him	213.8322
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that dartagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you	79.3867
do you promise i swear to you i will it is well	27.6962
tis he it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness	126.4066
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	231.9932
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	104.2749
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us yes but the son has done us no harm grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands	171.6716
i cant leave you alone in this abominable country thanks my worthy friend	358.0779
mr jackson said he go instantly to the lord chancellor and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders	99.2366
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you	66.5207
aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise	51.3221
you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter	185.7840
lift it and judge if i am mistaken the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless	183.5957
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker	237.4640
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksmanthere we are about equal	196.7020
thank god i am not a bravo and being a musketeer but for a time i only fight when i am forced to do so and always with great repugnance but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by you by _us_ you mean cried dartagnan	173.3893
the name of dartagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty	118.7986
we can now part come i shall engage your passage and you my dear boy i shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to parting	107.9293
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself	112.7281
the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government	272.8228
he is a fine young man of fair complexiona little too fair perhapspleasing in manners but you will see and judge for yourself by the way said the major you know i have only the francs which the abbé busoni sent me this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money that is a matter of course my dear m	150.0571
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of	108.8355
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe	309.8230
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	614.1865
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation	399.8860
the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	235.8086
i have only two adversariesi will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even themthey are time and distance	1251.8827
laporte could not leave the louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide	85.0436
these two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the other	236.5988
question then my lord where did the army cross the lys between saintvenant and aire by whom is it commanded by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke of how many does it consist eighteen thousand men and thirtysix cannon and its aim is lens you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers	330.1403
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek yes such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball was he not a finelooking man yes of lofty stature yes of pale complexion and brown hair yes yes that is he how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man	146.4522
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me courage madame courage do not despair the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation	316.9969
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated	72.8866
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	111.6079
oh where will be the end villefort rushed into the room	171.3855
do you know the count of monte cristo you mean monsieur zaccone i presume zacconeis not his name monte cristo monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name well be it solet us not dispute about words and since m	178.1803
it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	130.1753
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel	73.8663
you are right it is not you who should apprise m	554.5438
i mean the russian prince who you said had livres and we only found you must have searched badly luigi vampa himself searched in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that or spent the money possibly after all certainly	426.0974
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved	160.1853
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiersall proved the great richelieu no longer in existence	900.2726
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear dartagnan very good said dartagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous dartagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	189.8067
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king	77.9236

yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and illdefined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic	142.4216

an unhappy prisoner replied dantès who made no hesitation in answering	567.4540

do you know his house at auteuil certainly what do you know respecting it do you wish to know why he bought it yes the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments	113.5554
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus	109.0705
aramis went to cromwells desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis	135.8296

the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	257.6916
dartagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance	140.1441
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta	134.2128

as i expected my officer was there	1044.4666
de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect	170.2730
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room	51.8015
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance	57.8311
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris	48.9051
come gentlemen let us all propose some place	1581.7916
he found dartagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anteroom	112.7977
scarcely had dartagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night	149.8852
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly	331.4684
as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fête she was received by the city officials and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy	156.4594
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed	208.5891
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected	236.8844

grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm	163.1059
milady smiled and dartagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile	195.2388

noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man	240.9264
well did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward	186.0652
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos	68.3583
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you dartagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in miladys soul whose depths were dark and unknown	162.4009
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos echoing dartagnans sigh	222.5770
i say that he has hastily accused your majestys musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself	148.4151

gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats yes your excellency and it is true i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat your excellency is mistaken there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome	215.8225
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry	177.2425

a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men	165.1972
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse	147.6216
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	379.5844

de tréville as he has ended by styling himself in paris had really commenced life as dartagnan now did that is to say without a sou in his pocket but with a fund of audacity shrewdness and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his	403.4463
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m	85.4323

in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse but he will not wish for only one harness stake both _pardieu_ i am not selfish as you are you would do so said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself	274.2430
he saw then that he was with a poet	132.1677
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen and he raised his cane six inches higher	152.6850
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening	124.4215

but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility	248.6607
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly _london sir if you please and my master lord dartagnan_	232.9146

then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword	239.7178
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity	4450.2173
art thou dangerously wounded my dear mousqueton he said	41.2406
what is that line cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demitints of daybreak	457.7221
m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	144.8582
mademoiselle danglars was still the samecold beautiful and satirical	69104.5859
i do not reject it altogether said athos but i wish to remind aramis that he cannot quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours after the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us gentlemen said dartagnan what porthos says is full of sense ah ah but whats going on in the city yonder said athos	143.9980
at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside a cavalier richly dressed was close to the door	98.1885
so much the better said dartagnan	13.0082
oh i give you a hundred i give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit i received in your absence when about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de trévilles who has been here	79.2541
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly	424.8695
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy	292.9442
albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner	93.1749
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter	89.2175
ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert	507.8683
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving englandin case either of failure or of success	734.6890
cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said morrel	145.7881
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him	115.0944
my friends thats exactly like me i retained my harness by instinct	400.5724
six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served up	111.0216
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell	132.1615
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries	650.3576
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	206.6314
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them	2608.6650
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table	471.1386
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but dartagnan confined himself to telling them that m	123.6772
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state	52.6627
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being	148.7566
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness athos smiled	208.5609
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought	910.9799
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud yes as an augustine monk what sized man is he about my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair and he did not see raoul asked athos	306.0266
there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twentyfive thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander vi	411.3102
patrick who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name	63.6651
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time	204.7464
bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger	109.2985
who is that man he asked	191.3121

athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majestys guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friends and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majestys service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majestys service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal	135.2035
de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassinsome brigand escaped from the gallows apparently true said beauchamp i saw it in the paper	242.0472
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said dartagnan to the youth	58.4268
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there yes your majesty he answered trembling	60.6526
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold	921.5645
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman however that may be dartagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	122.5783
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong	239.1702
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria	286.1006
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex	229.4657

recollect the ancient romans of the circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men	315.8338
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	213.8202
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger	403.3326
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saintjacques unfortunately the generals valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speakers lips turned alternately red and pale	171.8385
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing	135.5174
good day dear dartagnan said aramis believe me i am glad to see you so am i delighted to see you said dartagnan although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to to himself my friend to himself but what makes you doubt it i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman	56.7985
i only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed _hors de combat_ in a cabaret squabble you dont do your work by halves	194.4960
_la jeune amélie_ had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible	383.8144
ah monseigneur continued bonacieux throwing himself at his eminences feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man the cardinal has touched me with his hand i have touched the hand of the great man cried bonacieux	142.7622
everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire	55.7189
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great however my mother had still some hope	474.1414
so _au revoir_ dear athos _au revoir_ said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought	159.4583
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself	108.4934
will this promise be fulfilled m	82.8361
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate dartagnan drew up his request and m	152.7355
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it	68.4086
and who am i to nourish such ambition	65955.8438
thats his province ay ay said porthos pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin well so be it said dartagnan	158.8928
m the same deadly silence succeeded these words	218.5745
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides commingess troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to dartagnan and porthos well search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy and i feel no doubt that thanks to dartagnans ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master that poor planchet you speak of him very much at your ease aramis he has probably been killed	204.8361
it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment	2233.2583
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble	288.4144
ah good morning my dear count said he	11.1427
france is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant and who is to pursue him cried mazarin	179.5567
the president again arose and having imposed silence saidsir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedif you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidi will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly	167.6939
once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest to horse said lord winter	128.5439
the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden	149.1765
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets	754.6580
and here madame i must add another word of explanation	376.1851
ah that is really original said beauchamp	94.1799
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know you	17.9126
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might	495.5456
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin	84.6580
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	446.0565
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis why because it is taking people unawares really athos you would make a singular general	214.9385
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to dartagnan	82.0287
now i have these proofs albert and i am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me	120.9303
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me no i thank you should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not i am not sure be twentyfour hours in prison without getting free my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly	185.9057
finally said felton finally what did they do at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer	210.6082
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself	161.4913
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved	129.2238
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la râpée never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her	133.5195
i will tell them to send her to you villefort returned and davrigny met him in the passage	108.3401
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	137.3752
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching	247.8044
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blundersi mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more is there indeed my good fellow	277.8197
just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray	34.6019
no he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night thats all	357.2225
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winterthe accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively	196.0548
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek	34.7810
i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men i encircled the castle the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out which i did not expect till tomorrow and i didnt hope to free you without a skirmish	164.2759
what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	223.1656
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own	97.2901
this athos then was a very extraordinary man	134.7269
this was neither long nor difficult	2787.7698
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh	143.0540
franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us	413.8466
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back	275.2996
diplomat or not i dont know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly	128.5773
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says	84.9643
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	82.9557
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god	97.4118
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champsélysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence	231.9767
noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house	340.9255
then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison	121.6774
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled has he eaten anything lately asked madame de villefort eluding her husbands question	281.8867
on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church	109.0749
look at my hat and cloak and dartagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver	631.3647
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers arms	400.0992
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battlefield you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons	213.1511
dartagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	137.4859
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear	152.5657
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	316.1674
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china	223.4744
take your handkerchief whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of it monsieur is a gascon asked aramis	69.0757
and now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	234.9272
they knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself	113.6633
which was the real delinquent both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post and where was this letter written at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast twas so thentwas so then murmured the abbé	159.1205
he resides in a quiet quarter continued aramis his tastes and his profession require it	239.4988
although dartagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercers pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart	234.2390
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut i will believe all you say so proceed but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience	110.4665
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnuttrees	268.3877
now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since and in he went mad and the change is astonishing	212.0575
i am lost said dartagnan to himself	62.8583
with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached	241.8920
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither	216.7891
speak make haste bind my arms my lord fast why bind thee that i may not be considered as your accomplice your hands asked grimaud	188.8054
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day	194.4208
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angelthose suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge m the young woman hid her face in her hands	134.7275
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities	1090.8853
listen madame and recall your remembrances	7091.2725
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances	1983.4021
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queenoh my lord oh my kingand that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	243.7870
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate	224.5418
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it	104.8919
the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary _cicerone_ who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to each monumentnay almost to each part of a monument	305.9435
de villefort notwithstanding his selfcontrol was visibly affected and when monte cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble	211.3178
the staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle	317.2628
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous	337.0745
as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty	115.6493
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told raoul bowed	119.4931
soon he saw the lights of la consigne	3788.8638
its tiresome work to keep awake a whole night yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream	368.7406
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive	197.8952
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him	171.8414
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door	87.6072
morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted	233.4450
de servieux the kings chamberlain who is in high favor at court	112.5037
mr spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him	91.8588
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky	226.2894
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertakers men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial	206.2543
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which dartagnan is blindly governed	580.8541

there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul	264.0083

m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	250.5777
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream the jeweller smiled	155.7282

for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind	171.6198
franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering	1284.2987
he can turn his coat inside out you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice dartagnan smiled	155.3588
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle	252.8121
what does the animal say asked the duke	24.9876

what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will no sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses	174.2329
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal well you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you i have my _full power_ show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name very well dont forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess to what purpose i am a victim of the cardinal	122.1542

that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance m the englishman smiled imperceptibly	344.8683
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city	31.1418
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said dartagnan	62.0779
ah ah said bonacieux you are a jocular companion but where the devil were you gadding last night my young master	302.8007

the count pretends i have not him to thankso be iti will erect an altar _deo ignoto_ listen said monte cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the fatherinlaw and the young man there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me and do you say this wedding is at hand oh yes in spite of all i could say	156.2875
my place of abode is no avenue des champsélysées but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home	92.5193
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat incredulously	280.5536
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	231.5954
his eyes remained open and menacing	10090.4922
i hear she said that paris is not quiet	215.4481
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace	1361.9742
poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately it is a poor lame posthorse in what state was the house when you left all was quiet but on returning from m	160.2890
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady	70.2635
de villefort and his father exchanged looks	461.3343
reflect then wretched man and repent no said caderousse no i will not repent	111.7688
i am profoundly ignorant of all these stockjobbing intrigues because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them ah said the count i see that m	361.8581
how sometimes the unhappy mistake chance for providence	492.0898
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	404.5249
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of bordeaux	309.7578
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies	305.8445
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour	197.9315
faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt	57.7061
an adventure on the high road	144.9557
god who knows all knows without doubt but as for me i accuse nobody oh what an abyss what an abyss cried felton	308.2628
i thank you for having recognized me sir debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor	157.7009
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian	139.5414
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	2466.8977
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment	1300.7183
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m	2229.7915
noirtier made a sign that it did	63.0297
it is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with dartagnan who most probably will be gasconheaded man will you have done said the king	99.4142
how could i then return to brussels	91.8770
there was no more to be had in saint germain	63.0517
is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself yes miserable wretch cried morcerf it is your fault danglars retreated a few steps	184.1735
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	229.9460
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justicethy words are words of gold chapter xx	550.5745
let us go and die with them said the king	41.4464
put an end to my doubts i have courage enough for any danger i can foresee for every misfortune which i understand	185.9351
allow me to introduce my friend baron de châteaurenaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champdemars yesterday châteaurenaud bowed to the countess	105.7425
while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to alberts while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard	276.1535
where is the key you speak of here it is ah my lord you will conduct us yourself then to that door very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door	91.6014
two musketeers were pacing the court to whom dartagnan called by their names	249.9171
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès	292.2086
well happily i dont say nay to it	1563.3729
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward	177.0395
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great ladyfor she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	190.1007
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	499.9049
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better this exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder	150.8471
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep	276.4092
the brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of rome	185.4978
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock	87.6984
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court	1297.9718
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon	253.5440
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams	251.2836
haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in arabic	176.7721
m no she replied it is for my poor grandmother	121.6067
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone	168.7595
afraid of making any inquiries at this house dartagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	73.0564
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	167.2583
but come what is this about asked porthos	227.7285
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and sidedishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head	403.2774
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bedthe bedstead being of oak	566.9854
as soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that convent but we must first learn what convent she is in thats true said porthos	164.2855
well three days after that you talked politics with m	363.5526
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelleenserval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	101.9790
god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space	236.1129
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks	297.3281
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint	83.1519
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said dartagnan	109.4912
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor	688.7851
but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate	146.6256
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming and the two friends began to laugh	117.6727
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth	312.9125
they listened he went into his sleepingroom and fastened the door inside	189.3423
we have arranged the ransom of each of them on arriving in france	44.2486
to one in edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value	136.8094
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form	1419.0642
dartagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses	169.1312
we have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners there could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received dartagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwells health	115.0332
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debtif indeed there existed oneand i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject	254.6814
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended	260.7454
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	659.2505
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses	174.6619
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident as to the rest m	88.3998
have you forgotten anything said aramis	34.4785
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance	100.9882
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i dont like to humiliate people then your duchess is still at the waters asked dartagnan	155.5325
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set	112.7174
this was to go himself to m	85.7813
your very devoted husband baron danglars the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his selfcontrol change color once or twice	347.6860
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonadesellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it	133.9303
eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage	159.5192
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried valentine	53.1848
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki	124.0655
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate before a siege yes the conditions will be better than afterward ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are come now what are your conditions rest yourself first my lord and wewe will reflect i do not need rest gentlemen i need to know whether i am among enemies or friends friends my lord friends well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible	174.4813
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody	525.3793
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone	110.6159
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	33.7796
it could no longer be doubted the family name was fully given	651.3430
why do you not realize a six months a years advance even and retire to brussels	457.3052
now gentlemen said dartagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs	113.9062
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible	95.8042
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded woman	167.4938
he had my love that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains	223.3063
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	99.8620
it was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	97.3729
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs	124.3442
scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean yes indeed my dear duke	66.1964
the duc dorléans visited the posts	29904.3848
has not one of you a cross asked athos	187.4918
send him away and all will then be well what do you wish me to do oh madame you are the queen queen forsooth when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen	151.8746
and now go mordaunt before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir a favor from me mordaunt bowed	107.0760
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	113.3580
on recognizing her stepmother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed	106.6812
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited	184.1591
the queen walked first every one followed her	93.7729
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it	166.3996
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs	581.2808
when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses	1617.5023
no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	98.9571
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory dartagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor	221.1666
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort	191.2662
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we cant fail to be beaten we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos	152.7795
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him	340.8023
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so nobleminded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	171.5625
come caderousse no nonsense said he	18.1523
give it me that i may see it is not false there it is the child put the piece of money into his pocket	85.3941
the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer	91.8798
let us dispense with useless words	2666.7000
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said dartagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied dartagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead did you not say she was dead three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved	137.1965
no i do not jest _mordieu_ i should like to have seen you in my place i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied dartagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm	141.1078
it was danglars letter to the kings attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m	58.7133
listen said morrel it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position which is a serious and urgent one i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret	193.7760
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent	153.8355
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more	188.6658
in england lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation by whom then were we beaten asked porthos	361.1780
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there yes youre right replied the companion	204.4594
lord winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	97.7542
i took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners again said dartagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word _coiners_	329.5987
ill circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow	29.9295
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	267.3036
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you	231.0263
yes sir a whole bottle if you will drink my health willingly answered the soldier	147.5411
grimaud is it thou grimaud signified that he was not mistaken	36.6918
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy not i	266.7249
at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string m and are you going there i am what telegraph do you intend visiting	463.4713
there will be eleven crowns gained it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in dartagnans purse	307.3736
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance	257.1272
i have since learned that he was confined in the château dif and i should like to learn some particulars of his death what was his name the abbé faria oh i recollect him perfectly cried m	64.4713
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note	358.9613
he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry	188.5995
at two oclock the tennis balls began according to grimauds directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over	206.2081
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death	519.9418
the handsome madeleine announced to dartagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit	170.9943
his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blueveined lids and he tottered like a drunken man	572.1474
you pretend not to knowbecause government was not rich enough ah pardon me said châteaurenaud i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i cannot understand them yet you will by and by said debray	108.5985
de villefort are both coming to this dinner	105.1229
he must be mad said the inspector	41.1301
well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her workroom and by whom was your wife abducted i know nothing surely monsieur but i suspect someone and who is the person whom you suspect a man who has pursued her a long time the devil but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this less love than politics replied dartagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect monsieur i beg you to observe that i ask you absolutely nothing	78.9330
sir he thus addressed dartagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell these words struck dartagnan like a thunderbolt	241.9429
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure	431.9800
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand	115.9752
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed dartagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her	115.9878
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray	361.6273
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	100.3162
this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dantès had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it	242.0760
well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out	62.9610
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil _rue du helder on the_ _st may halfpast ten_ chapter	306.4299
cavalcanti as the counts father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres	312.5383
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen	255.6545
and all thisall this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	104.2190
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment	344.4975
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	107.4935
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow	134.0315
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them	190.5235
monsieur said mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master phoebus could no longer hold out and silence said porthos	77.1762
ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws i had lost allin thirteen throws	1127.2700

the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing him from arrest there has been no arrest how it is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv	256.2871

he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles	155.8617
the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemaryfor upon seeing this hotheaded youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before	202.5674
this time dartagnan was not hasty	202426.0938
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai dorléans	122.4466

the two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone	97.8264
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us what aramis you think that dartagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy among friends my dear athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head	111.8408

and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting these words redoubled the eagerness of dartagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace	208.3923
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dantes damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels	487.0240

i thought i had told you a most lamentable story and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart	53.2197
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	211.9536

he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	352.3204

sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest _gendarme_ of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction	181.9713

the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive	611.8795
what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffledup individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom	143.4015

yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously	317.5364
there only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled	232.3496
a moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow	185.6955
at last his patience was exhausted	2044.1667

porthos was discontented with his condition	7064.5220
arriving at the faubourg st antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille but as it was the bastille alone he looked at he did not observe milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two illlooking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him	136.3478

at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	201.1926
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier	408.7875

upon my word said monte cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular people	149.6758
what does this mean demanded he of the cardinal	27.1368
its a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved	298.6236
lord de winter tore his hair	275.9355

upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador	310.5311

but the kings of modern times restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor desire	895.0809
his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency	417.7270

as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air	145.9169

i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply	140.2581
as a further precaution they had bound his hands	566.8297
i am no swordsman well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter	55.9398

you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion egad said dartagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebut i shoot sometimes that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits really how very amusing yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing dartagnan now no longer counted the sighs	222.2496

the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room	155.1398
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels	105.5020

he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions	108.8698
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed	115.5340

there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society	299.2051
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment still my lord i cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to dartagnan take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought dartagnan we shall yet be able to do business together he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	212.2009

if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging mebesides i may not be there myself where at your ball why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that purpose you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments tell me what it is my mother begs you to come the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting	91.4790
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when francs leave the wifes pocket the husband always finds it out	193.9883
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julies cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count	145.0911
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which edmond had concealed from all others	244.3261
what were you saying to this youngster my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in troublous times and that todays events are very like those in the days of the ligue of which i heard so much in my youth	173.5469
should you like to be rich and your own master _parbleu_ said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question take the postchaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pontdebeauvoisin	298.5154
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she i am sure of it nevertheless i confess i still doubt but the _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence athos she is your wife i tell you repeated dartagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually it was dartagnan who now shook his head in his turn	135.5473
groslow began turning the cards one after another	198.6131
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	100.0823
if while he was being carried out the gravediggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose	107.4992
porthos instead of returning directly home dartagnan alighted at the door of m	39.3760
he strictly followed the instructions he had received	20.9900
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired baker	123.2181
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m	356.0102
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme	285.3273
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me	49.8776
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared	142.7069
this point settled the duke turned to dartagnan	40.8736
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait ah a monthsix monthsa year it is too long a time	138.9035
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina	181.5286
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected	114.9086
well then said dartagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences	201.0203
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there	386.2632
maximilianemmanuelif we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room	85.6936
is that monte cristo asked the traveller to whose orders the yacht was for the time submitted in a melancholy voice	129.6755
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night	274.7295
the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question	115.5908
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii	105.1767
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	333.0370
a handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not my faith said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you	95.5887
at two oclock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of monsieur de tréville	33.3026
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat	109.4441
revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed	117.2901
i require honorable guaranties i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guaranty	293.4134
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune	58.4878
ah traitor muttered dartagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix	208.7162
the general depended much on it he even came to force m	308.1322
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes who then urged you to write	219.4431
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winters inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word	225.4369
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husbands strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan	138.9615
it seems to me said dartagnan with a thousand livres eachi do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word _procurator_ roused porthos	521.0535
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving dartagnan how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man	49.3755
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied dartagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come said dartagnan aloud i have no motive for defending monsieur	136.7815
what could explain athoss having reentered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table	128.7687
now said he im off to the bishops	221.3212
penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his masters daughter mademoiselle julie and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault	195.3160
handle the musket and the sword my dear fellow	54.6825
is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied dartagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shutup houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven then monsieur is satisfied asked planchet	139.1864
because i am too young to die the woman you poisoned at béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said dartagnan	114.1012
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage	178.1072
really captain groslow you are too much in fortunes way	735.8740
there was to be sure father joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence as the cardinals familiar was called	299.3453
then he rested he must be near chapelleenserval where he pretended to be going	62.2280
jacqueslouis david a famous french painter	7918144.0000
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer	197.3658
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you i do not enter the church i reenter it	188.7442
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily	101.1132
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after	221.8662
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise	45.4141
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement	559.5787
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month	222.9147
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back i am paid the duke went from one surprise to another	119.1118
what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tired parry resumed his reading	256.4288
she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage	375.6078
never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i cannot help believing them valentine	458.6666
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in two parties had set out for paris	232.4706
on my honor they are not poisoned	310.9921
take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred pistoles dartagnan only required one reason to be satisfied	116.8192
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting	200.0805
are you not going tomorrow morning at six oclock louis to bathe at conflans	897.9271
i pray for it said dartagnan	10.9580
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was	99.2779
what then are you i am about to tell you wretched man oh mon dieu i am john francis de winter i do not know you said the executioner	66.9867
sblood does that astonish you and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method	139.3406
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m	150.2618
this garden has never been a cemetery what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently	1240.1578
this was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover	482.1352
come come my little fellow dont be angry	545.2663
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well	135.1223
father and daughter volume five chapter	385.6740
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays	277.1700
a draught of wine dartagnan oh ill answer for you said the gascon filling porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion upon what asked porthos	142.1457
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check	3001.0076
albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position	375.1950
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man as to felton he hesitates	784.6643
the blow was sped by dartagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	184.6767
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from herthis silver casket and these two letters	455.7715
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at all	84.0874
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction	313.9034
no longer could edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	157.6893
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	103.3222
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow	182.1544
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice	1126.5231
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	256.6245
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay	211.0588
what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness i bitterly reproach myself i assure you well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips	201.6288
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m	61.7405
as to you good sir you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on that head	221.6936
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes returned dartagnan	117.8072
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity	286.0968
de la trémouille commanded a little reflection	427.4195
is the committee willing to hear this witnessyes yes they all said at once	788.0852
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced	342.7072
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	157.9180
for his death the death of your prince yes how so because he has made his will in my favor indeed on my honor for how much for five hundred thousand only that	83.7132
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency	432.6863
come louise let us talk of our affairs	52.0434
i have known you four days i have loved him four years	49.8881
noirtiers apartment yes can you mean it valentine i have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his helpcome be careful valentine said morrel hesitating to comply with the young girls wishes i now see my errori acted like a madman in coming in here	236.6400
is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement	141.0174
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him	112.8770
zounds how you manoeuvre my instructions count you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling	138.8132
you have been to sea yes i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands what of that	221.7442
we will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength up great god said mme	303.9777
oh leave me sir you are tempting meyou make me doubt the goodness of providenceit is impossible it cannot be are you the first that this hand has stricken	285.8824
now dherblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached dartagnan	106.8612
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours countyou who are the very flower of our nobilityto squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists really count if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you	291.2489
how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who	53.5447
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity	95.2092
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes	1451.6970
as to your rank an annual income of livres will enable you to support it admirably	418.1920
porthos was the first who came to himself	45.0122
_au revoir_ then that is all i have to say today	93.5469
there were two doors he bolted them both	4310.7900
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell	247.6428
yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucienand considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures	135.7041
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sicknurse	369.3987
_a propos_ monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger	107.3411
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered	158.4345
two of the men from jacopos boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles	303.0514
i know because it is my office to know everything	137.7079
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at ones baptism for instance which naturally comes before ones proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of ones devotion something to gain and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil that of bracieux in the soissonais and that of pierrefonds in the valois	169.5303
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	73.7632
but come i am waiting for you both men entered monte cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no	125.0453
tomorrow is the twentythird and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet he sets sail tomorrow where for for la rochelle he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind	544.5463
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the count of sanfelices flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning	354.5345
the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it	172.2408
_certes_ if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron	123.7158
well if you will have the truth and me too said athos	105.7928
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of italy	161.5859
oh no sir said madame danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality m ah yes said monte cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination	138.9967
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the king	134.7297
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	102.3897
the duke glanced at the clock	1262.2483
valentine hid her head between her hands	10.2510
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower	51.0811
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray	160.5954
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other	147.6660
but you sent for me my dear child	26.7598
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentines room	110.0877
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a womans happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings	340.5148
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was mad	274.6143
de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than raoul who was only fifteen	126.1922
above all she is very richat least i believe so said monte cristo	129.7431
oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two months	713.8984
oh my dear dartagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me conceal your wounds when you have any silence is the last joy of the unhappy	146.5645
let me be on my guard and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied	212.5362
i present my letter from the queen to the superior and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seeknot into lorraine not into belgium but to paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle	189.1045
you know the marquis of saintméran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival yes said monte cristo i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them but that is not all not all no they were going to marry their daughter to m	122.6487
i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers they are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going on in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the duc de beaufort drew his sword	220.4828
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair	381.7293
never never the devil said athos	11.7664
_pardieu_ cried dartagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get cold can it gentlemen added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his friends	122.9864
dartagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them	125.5980
i think you wished to do so of your own accord you are right madame said the king and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me	45.9625
a lieutenant in the corsican battalion a soldier of the usurper then a soldier of the french army well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword you are mistaken monsieur i replied he has perished by the poniard what do you want me to do asked the magistrate	104.8650
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride	244.4783
ay but it is for the first time madame i did not say france my lord i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a frenchman but did you see the queen it is useless replied henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no	84.7124
de chevreuse who told it to two or three of her intimates that yielding to his vocation he had retired into a conventonly into which nobody knew	295.5628
bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master	38.5576
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	68.4681
i would rather have had a hat said dartagnan	106.5039
now in the army from the divisiongenerals who desire the death of the generalinchief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some ones death	380.9995
i opened the door of the anteroom myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing	87.4153
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	533.9838
de tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded man	142.0994
a table ready set out awaited them	186.0456
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain thatand i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight i worked at night also replied faria	185.7689
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	213.8475
come dont look so angry and you shall have francs of the money to do what you like with and eugénie shall have	88.4424
then i must wait asked the young man	7.3772
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers	277.6696
mordaunt mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed dartagnan	195.5459
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him	100.5200
you are perhaps a tulip fancier my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so	90.8985
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips	205.9533
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand	145.0779
what company company of tréville advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour the three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving athos the post of speaker	211.8242
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace	100.4264
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count	381.1767
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor	69.4029
then he has neither the parliament nor the people with himthey represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of france dartagnan scratched his ear	301.6587

the generation who follow us are very precocious come beauchamp said châteaurenaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us	116.9435
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you m noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	133.7171
quick said a voice at the end of the gallery	12.3824

now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming i follow you m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlinis part	377.5955

it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp	303.6500

ah your pardon said albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampas torch	479.1619
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	221.4192

i shall not go why asked porthos	68.7588
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy	418.6978

he delayed presenting himself at morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him	122.7143
at length tuesday came the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival	176.0377

the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	162.1960
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed	361.4521
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	147.5375

the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	481.6014

as he had twenty times touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	511.7030
morrel attributed penelons embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the _pharaon_ longer	148.1101
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by enchantment	64.8023

was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery	225.4804
athos cried dartagnan wringing his hands	1.3430
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare	223.5733
lord de winter on quitting dartagnan gave him his sisters address	175.6763
a folded paper fell from edwards breast	3032.3110
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	679.2394
another possessed all mercédès heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead	167.3118
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar	279.3301
we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward dartagnan	132.3738
i would have saved madame de saintméran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living	137.1889
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive you think then that i may rely on the counts promises certainly i do you are sure he will keep his word with me to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts	78.0616
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine yes and for a considerable sum what is the amount asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm	175.2294
he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic	148.1854
the queen had just regained her chamber and dartagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly touched	73.1593
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources however my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m	109.5323
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection	325.2263
straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found i can show you answered the gascon	64.6794
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	235.9638
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes	257.2357
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance	559.2269
what are you about said dartagnan	21.7413
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	149.7427
and perhaps his saddle therewith no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos	99.2547
some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt aramis shuddered in spite of himself	156.0941
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait	123.6141
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	144.4076
do you suppose i carry francs in my pocket your excellency has francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at francs apiece and half a fowl for the danglars shuddered	220.1107
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person	84.1817
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	147.6826
i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself	117.6881
swords then cried aramis swords let us not lose a moment the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game	161.5066
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draughtall these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici	535.8171
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right	96.5357
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill	549.8446
that is my answer the answer was terrible	384.7561
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he therefore went forward without a moments hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half	161.4975
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door well dont be inactive inactive my dear fellow ask porthos	316.3153
de villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé	578.0904
i rang for a light but as no one came i determined to find one for myself	185.7128
the king and his escort were no longer there	79.3561
i congratulate you my dear m	33.1994
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on	148.3902
but dont fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word	81.7230
m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	241.9571
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	616.5674
you were asking then said the host in spanish	143.8184
he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in spite of his earnest prayers dantès remained a prisoner	294.9649
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english	1030.7139
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention	219.9072
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmonds favor	432.6123
you will find in the same way four relays on your route	555.6566
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte cristo	82.4617
really said she i believe you now begin to hesitate no i do not hesitate but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him	65.1371
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and dartagnan	38.8276
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count	146.6217
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion	106.6546
as regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know monsieur dartagnan that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you	104.1010
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winters neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereigns confidence and friendship	221.6401
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago m no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	102.9660
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought	335.8846
you are inclining toward false doctrines my young friend you will be lost you will be lost said the curate shaking his head sorrowfully	55.7106
the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m	172.7525
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair	1742.0737
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his goldmounted cane the papers that lay on the table	172.2198
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near	153.0790
there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal from harlequin even to pantaloon chevalier chevalier said athos	285.9956
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet	188.0831
first madame who are you who am i	127.5456
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks	196.8132
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefortobserve that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefortvillefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the soninlaw of the marquis and marquise de saintméran	141.8020
cavalcanti who had remained in the drawingroom with the ladies was the last to leave the bankers house	74.9862
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence	232.7401
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged	278.2967
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	31.0253
dépinay went onyou are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one the president stopped the coach	195.9207
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	139.6144
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m	66.9360
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them and these men were your friends one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me	60.8294
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz	200.1486
and what is a fronde inquired mazarin	346.8969
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone	101.4980
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies	448.7870
it was very polite of you come said andrea what do you want you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend that is not righttake care or i may become troublesome this menace smothered the young mans passion	167.4917
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eelsall light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said dartagnan who furnishes the wine	542.5286
and charles i furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans	670.4169
there is one comfort we are all in cash said dartagnan	60.9060
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders	152.2635
it will be even more difficult to descend dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	121.2785
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	516.7797
not before me behind me but with what asked the duke	60.6116
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m	174.7948
they advanced towards a boat which a customhouse officer held by a chain near the quay	326.3665
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was dartagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping aramis shook his head	154.5057
oh my god what has he done	155.8993
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me	119.2702
thats all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos	89.3311
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved	675.5107
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him	375.6431
i am not unhappy while i possess my son ah just so said albert here begins the trial	168.2239
now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example not at all plainly enough messrs	238.6907
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo	67.7755
but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits i have a dreadful headache said albert	158.8591
now one evening when dartagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	144.1671
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	397.8052
i shall retire and die tranquillyat home for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron you shall be one and have you not seen any of our other friends yes i have seen aramis and what does he wish	76.0267
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything wrong undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish	151.5040
comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	16523.1973
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line	184.1876
leave me alone said aramis impatiently	62375.3828
danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod	622.5038
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion	105.2287
here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room	141.0237
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him what eagerly replied the prince will i permit	159.7397
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	170.3857
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed	283.6992
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i dont know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of what the mercers wife of the rue des fossoyeurs	122.2924
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme	175.5770
you have understood me then dear monsieur dartagnan said milady	55.8552
the palais de justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the accoules	884.5491
the island of monte cristo chapter	419.5140
gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me here a long time incognito no my lord replied the gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here then you will be besieged we expect it and what shall you do defend ourselves	89.8595
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m	214.7538
milady de boulogne evening of the twentyfifth	4623.7749
now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors	99.8837
ay and observeit just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the antichrist well said milady	302.7360
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	149.0711
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableausuch is the instability of the human mindwas the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope	252.4905
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he _was_ superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred	391.2105
m dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	1232.2449
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner	167.5815
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other	238.1154
have you admired the rapidity of my fall	45.2312
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal	175.7977
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way	47.6947
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names	295.5968
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina	148.9265
so that thanks to her friends generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the bestattired peasant near rome	741.2057
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brotherinlaw monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers monseigneur is correctly informed said dartagnan	154.4281
having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery	229.4424
you are placed on high my lord but tremble above you there is the king above the king there is god however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him	215.7223
what have you done with monsieur de bruy	222.1953
in about ten minutes dartagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos	112.5185
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé her brotherinlaw whom she now hated mortally	270.1023
it was said that madame de longueville for whom the prince had more than a brothers affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet	141.1194
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign	247.3410
have you anything to ask of me	19.2071
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her	208.5512
zounds cried aramis i may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat apropos i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen	198.5784
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie	182.7792
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	443.7141
do you mean is he a good comrade	383.1910
it is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a master come you are joking yourself now	245.6635
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier	668.0851
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day	112.4316
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial	102.3368
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant	100.3525
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonderfor whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great i will not contradict you there said dartagnan	174.9083
the jailer went away shaking his head	1.2845
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well	105.9057
this league was directed against france	158.5427
say on you will permit me to make one remark certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction	101.6053
i dont know such a place and that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried athos	106.8577
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis	171.4215
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity	3804.5671
faith no thank heaven replied raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering i fear we arrived too late	246.6291
parry said the king rising too my horse i desire to go to thirsk egad said dartagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london how so because before then we shall have carried him off well this time athos said dartagnan upon my word you are mad have you some plan in your head then asked aramis	117.3188
i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives i only love him and a young girl called mercédès	229.3420
speak out theres a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise	158.7453
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	32.7987
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better	80.6065
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have said to you to this man or i am lost and it would be youyou then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to feltons mouth	117.0156
noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer	180.8464
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home	122.9344
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house	44.0426
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimauds hands but grimaud shook his head	106.8780
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris	90.2511
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m	96.4275
well then said mordaunt i choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere calls himself athos athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends monsieur mordaunt a duel between us is impossible	129.1944
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth	169.8530
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	114.3170
for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dantès to learn it by heart and dantès knew it from the first to the last word	120.8481
when he had finished with the orangetree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orangetree pricked him dreadfully	688.2355
at that moment he cut it	33.0610
monsieur the abbé said he do you like blows with a cane i cannot say monsieur answered i no one has ever dared to give me any well listen to me then monsieur the abbé if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it myself i really think i must have been frightened	89.1036
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms	201.1721
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthoss long cloak and dartagnan rushed straight into the middle of it	192.2469
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped	154.8167
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him	203.4175
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	276.8788
as the counts title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is thisthomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me	185.2778
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight	196.9676
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel	142.2463
yes the gascon answered athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body	1065.7333

the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos	89.4498
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	214.0620
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection	1357.5930
the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale	1274.7041
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her	124.7127

yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon	175.6222
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me anything well then my dear count present me to your princess i will do so but on two conditions i accept them at once the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers i give you my oath that i will not enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not	106.0046
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all times that is quite true said barrois and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility	188.4899
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friends ear	100.7754
you do not believe me my lord i never believe cardinals who are not priests well on the faith of a minister you are no longer a minister my lord you are a prisoner then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardinal	73.4970
davrigny in the same pitiless tonem	44618576.0000
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend	198.4957
he repliedhe replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	160.1987
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	791.5032
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wife_diable_ and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true	222.5208

he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him	197.6149
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the countoh he is so dreadfully pale i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out	140.1850
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance	358.7850
from lord de winter repeated buckingham let him come in felton entered	167.4150
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	286.9009
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained	80.1306
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction	72.2352
how dartagnan and porthos earned by selling straw	2233.8281
villefort took a chair but valentine remained standing by her fathers side and franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand	181.4256
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind	55.2256
there was a moments silenceit was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body	65.5438
as we said before by ten oclock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve oclock to one at cours la reine	152.5041
but i must not forget one grand point which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense i have indeed by circumstances no by you by me	333.9591
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawingroom namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and m	285.0299

patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be	151.3608
letters had been despatched to m	98.9574
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for dont you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirtytwo millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i dont know anything about that replied renée but m	395.7131
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors	282.1364
you appear to think much of your horse	78.8866
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign	179.6399
alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy	336.3868
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance	196.8817
well cried milady in a sharp voice	96.2932
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpentmy turn	366.7515
they passed into the next drawingroom where tea was prepared	1271.7250
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	139.4586
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz	328.8132
silence he said or you are lost	45.7616
it appears there is something fresh aboard aramis said athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the parpaillot i believe yes how did you fare for my part i ate but little	136.1588
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majestys ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor dartagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues	167.9124
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow	180.6960
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	32.4029
but the dead cannot return their fire certainly not they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls	159.7170
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a bankerwith economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur demery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant	180.4304
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory	157.8467
i know something of him but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back tomorrow which means that you now hesitate no i do not hesitate god forbid but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope milady answered by a glance which said is that allspeak then and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she tenderly	194.7088
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne	78.8611
yet you have unquestionably some ambition i have sir and what may it be i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listeni have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists	154.3105
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day	222.5905
downstairs in the decanter whereabouts downstairs in the kitchen shall i go and fetch it doctor inquired villefort	131.7182
your power is great i know but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons	262.3284
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges	240.1250
it is for me to give orders here and not you monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you i want none it was a temporary indisposition	187.6268
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause	301.7699
what would you do i should give up broussel said porthos	80.5672
at the same moment whilst dartagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase	198.2063
you were you know how i settled the matter did he die i dont know	120.3470
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly do not let that disturb you i have enough for two no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse good caderousse so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me true remorse and besides an idea had struck me andrea shuddered he always did so at caderousses ideas	144.4912
dantès must be crushed to gratify villeforts ambition	25939.0684
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital yes monseigneur you came through meung where something befell you	139.5181
emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house	133.7938
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for	64.9039
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of chapter xxxv	113.2767
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	129.6149
i will prevent you m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings who am i repeated monte cristo	520.4121
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard	54.2587
i feared it maximilian said she it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you did i not stop you at once with the word impossible morrel impossible you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it said morrel sorrowfully	122.1061
yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word	685.3049
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble	184.0011
you allow me to give you this title continued the count in french it is necessary to excite this mans confidence you can speak before me said franz i am a friend of the counts good returned peppino	91.3060
all day dantès walked up and down his cell	125.4685
dépinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with albert and châteaurenaud	159.9407
it was a quarter past midday	27425.0879
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling the baroness became pale	454.4958
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne	330.7289
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman	628.0270
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life	362.3344
yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow	551.4426
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray	273.5542
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	267.5752
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	1538.8672
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying	304.7640
he then gave himself up to his happiness	70.6645
so far well said athos i perceive you know me the comte de la fère murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther	110.6757
no one can say that m	331.5431
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is	716.7387
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen	141.3683
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind	31.7875
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for anything	75.6527
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon	406.4293
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	30.4451
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive	258.3949
marie michon and what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading	142.9128
what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heartonly to make a woman of thirtynine look like a woman of fifty	177.2264
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	165.0964
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate	250.7817
look and dartagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	365.3849
there is nobody within said bonacieux	208.3692
i do not know you read this letter he said handing it to her	183.7098
there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment	657.5038
wrapped in this sweet idea dartagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment	122.8539
you have waterwoodsflowers there she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color	601.1490
go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet i have finished mine seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon dartagnan but he had too strong an adversary	133.5391
diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh	111.2354
reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you threaten to speak and i will condemn you to infamy you cried i	291.0614
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour to tell you that you are free your excellency my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleons maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life	114.3016
besides it doesnt concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon ah that is true said athos	66.9075
why did you not come down to breakfast	126.2281
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god	172.0575
as for his suspicions once on _terra firma_ once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite	256.2574
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief	445.1561
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go	203.5342
when are you to be married i will tell you all said valentine from you i have nothing to conceal	51.9465
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes	162.9988
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it	133.0811
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt	289.1968
ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport where do you see that island continued the captain pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea	274.2184
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable caves	870.8778
come said dartagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match	214.8217
eugénie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person	141.6476
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	1047.4501
to the judgeto the judge madame it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame	104.5730
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse	410.9838
morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond i will let you know that directly i have seen m	101.8054
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations	248.7299
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure	137.6518
hope faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance	127.4606
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum ah sir you know well i would risk my life for you thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet	416.0487
you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door	108.6562
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale	198.1118
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty	121.3886
he pardoned and having pardoned he remained	282.8152
ninetenths of the english people are horrified at what you say this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser	223.4897
but fortunately the world is a sepulcher the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie fie dartagnan dartagnan cried aramis you are killing me well here it is at last said dartagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket	92.0593
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression	180.6880
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight	245.2563
ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with me the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound	185.7195
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his fathers grave but then he had the woman he loved still remaining you are deceived morrel that woman she was dead worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed	144.2786
for the last time will you come cried milady	89.6529
debray in pacifying a kingdom you m	437.0162
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder	78.4001
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent	178.2417
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peacefulshall i say more poeticthan if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars	266.4986
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	193.7440
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	267.1172
i informed my superiors that i did not feel myself sufficiently prepared for ordination and at my request the ceremony was postponed for a year	162.8661
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large	97.6264
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel	92.0724
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence	187.4725
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them	505.6788
go then animal said the duke but remember i only allow you half an hour may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau my lord yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment	151.5410
have you anything particular against him possibly did you ever meet him previously to coming hither i have and where will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you i promise upon your honor upon my honor then listen to me franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them	85.2131
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	272.7798
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary	228.9183
ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men	144.5210
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a sideglance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is prettyi think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing	154.3989
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved	2402.7070
if she seduced your brotheryou said she seduced him did you not yes if she caused his deathyou said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner	164.7999
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	264.0242
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he	65.2602
no one ever asked her where she was going	109.4648
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids	349.3838
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen	1027.4614
what a hundred thousand francs for a fowl ah excellency you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves come come this is very drollvery amusingi allow but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat	312.5716
but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question	90.9574
the rain of blood as the jeweller returned to the apartment he cast around him a scrutinizing glancebut there was nothing to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened	135.0712

without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it	65.9597
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	279.0451
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory	111.8396
i say _there_ for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there	249.5800
i retreated with the rest for eightandforty hours	4403.9404
when the gentleman who came three months agothe agent of thomson frencharrives announce his arrival to me cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself	174.2037
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week for as i had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearlymy wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears truly yes	163.4522
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men	3067.5984
the count soon heard andreas voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano	447.4286
come my brother go with me added dartagnan and i will see that you are made a duke no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy to that i can say nothing returned dartagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron	151.6423
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death grimaud hesitated	152.1618
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	668.1434
it might be a vengeance of milady that was most probable	186.0487
for me said dartagnan are you sure of that _pardieu_ monsieur i cant be more sure	158.4716
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	176.9755
i have only the letters of ali tepelini which i have placed before you the ring a token of his goodwill which is here and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been gained	166.3770
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open	92.8874
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guardi did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet	133.1060
which i received this morning dartagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it	83.3810
lord de winter exclaimed the count	6.9757
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	95.1810
aramis whom we have sent for thats true said athos we must wait for aramis at that moment aramis entered	82.1846

m ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed	329.6286
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	139.7258
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service dartagnan i shall be grateful to you all my life very well	71.9928
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty	950.0802

she remained nearly always in her secondfloor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the doora duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte	544.6196

with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers athos smiled	294.9871

if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistakenmaximilian started as if he had been electrified	230.0124
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	80.2771
i know no better means than to act with candor	145.7555
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues	163.4709
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother	106.1644

in short why should i have any more to do with the affair	90.4013
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle darmillys fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantios malediction on desdemona	989.5357
dartagnan to wait i shall have further need of him these words gave great joy to dartagnan	259.0504

morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair	46.2679
it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless no that his style of writing is very good this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out albert laughed	419.6416

as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual	56.3674
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	191.5439

shivering for want of a fagot why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin	263.0054

the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs	341.2233
i was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me danglars reflected for a moment	60.9633
i also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons for a thousand pistoles for a thousand pistolesjust that amount the beggar not one too many and you have them they are here upon my word i think he acted very generously generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service a great servicewhat was that why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor what that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery thats the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	166.5126
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	150.7979
de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue	137.4136
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows	135.7000
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad eventpoor girl so young so rich so beautiful could you have imagined this scene châteaurenaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract indeed no said châteaurenaud did you know her i spoke to her once or twice at madame de morcerfs among the rest she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy	286.8224
but i cannot said she i am not strong enough do you shut it ah you do well to ask said eugénie laughing i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle darmilly passed the bolt of the padlock through	141.0800
_a propos_ add one thing what i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden	392.7129
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him and are there no cardinals that can fight	164.4539
two men to the astonishment of dartagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier	189.4535
therefore athos had invented the phrase _family affair_	2728723.7500
i inquired immediately on my return to paris the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years	86.0019
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said dartagnan	30.9009
a man what man a mendicant give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor sinner this mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see him has he sent no particular message for me yes	153.8055
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour	60.4051
oh yes tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have with pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be despised	237.2137
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind dartagnan still directing them from behind with his voice	327.2173
i dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	419.8286
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the childs face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	328.8483
i was obliged to brand the guilty one and he gentlemen was my brother i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment	131.3470
goodnatured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate	126.1795
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted	108.2887
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo	160.7608
at that moment the countenance of mme	74.8296
well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos	133.0951
mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance	222.3077
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	280.1470
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	681.8420
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a newborn puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton	151.0670
this is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair	78.9506
she had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of sanfelices daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her	75.3444
ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made	53.4349
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino	165.3034
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman	120.2142
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am well said comminges suppose one thing i will suppose anything you please suppose there were a window in this wall well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his the count then is in the chateau yes for what reason the same as yourself athosa prisoner you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison dont let us play upon words sir	137.2122
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	71.8832
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port	80.0826
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said dartagnan	291.4713
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew	87.2999
you put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as i told you oh monsieur monsieur you will kill yourself cried planchet	73.3017
besides were not those riches chimericaloffspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him	85.5594
how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling	845.1849
well exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison	1220.8472
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me	163.0307
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	99.4048
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are two months ago you were dying with hunger the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling	342.6938
he should have been nothing said the king nothing	86.7266
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands	69.1544
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence my chaise broke down coming into lilliers capital what _capital_ yes i want your chaise and how shall i travel then on horseback you talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues whats that one can do it afterward afterward	512.0769
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellowcountrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor destiny destiny murmured the abbé	190.3981
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	776.0946
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a diamond	41.1538
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	74.0961
and madame de villefort which they deserve do they not i believe they do	175.4610
the rest of the dinner was to come	87.7817
now i repeat my father is named m	142.5323
the title attracted me i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them	112.2644
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now	158.8091
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father then sire may i present him this instant duke where is he waiting below in my carriage seek him at once i hasten to do so the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again	263.5490
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress	88.3031
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant what mousqueton is here then oh yes monsieur	312.2416
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her dartagnan then related the poisoning of mme	544.3846
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her	454.3370
gaspard puget the sculptorarchitect was born at marseilles in	52.2874
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide for	98.1075
besides are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud mousqueton and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos porthos and aramis yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you please	63.3985
as soon as the door of gondys study was opened a man rushed in	514.2508
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo	221.2623
the abbé told me it was worth francs muttered caderousse	309.0273
the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you a specimen of a bachelors apartment	123.3196
the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea	251.0021
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which dartagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence	189.0845
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his	46.2779
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said dartagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos	126.0390
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire	220.9719
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods	1182.6290
tell me what i am to do for this a very easy thing if your horse isnt tired i tell you hell go like the windonly tell me which way to drive towards the louvres ah i know the wayyou get good sweetened rum over there exactly so i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelleenserval	339.1008
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her	247.6557
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow	338.2632
i will look at it again and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded	164.8190
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger	149.3510
cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents	639.2107
the first moments of her captivity were terrible a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature	470.8109
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	401.7709
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet continue said the queen	196.0887
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy	188.8410
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos	1215.1729
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to dartagnan	101.6936
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion but a humpbacked general under the cuirass the hump will not be seen	483.7121
now madame said debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still francs the interest of this money in my hands but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest excuse me madame said debray coldly i had your permission to do so and i have made use of it	140.9639
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the counts pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting	126.2757
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo i introduce no one and certainly not m	67.0924
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinals suite turned back	121.1089
they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions	810.6013
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton	70.1685
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud	298.0161
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion it matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs	156.0849
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance	213.3771
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you pray dont mention such a thing said the count	60.1327
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of béthune with milady her mortal enemy	167.9411
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand noyes he was	375.4312
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry	43.0132
at the moment of arriving at st paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself twice	397.6447
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugénie	140.1731
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti	1125.4460
who made the lemonade i did did you bring it to your master directly it was made no you left it somewhere then in the meantime yes i left it in the pantry because i was called away who brought it into this room then mademoiselle valentine davrigny struck his forehead with his hand	116.7422
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	190.0466
you were writing i your fingers are stained with ink ah true i was writing	243.4288
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one	86.2940
what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation what a delicious abbé you would have made oh its only a temporary postponement replied aramis i shall be one someday	428.5331
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture	175.9098
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted	71.2923
the warm pressure made dartagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked himself	233.5025
i can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject	82.3127
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy	298.1323
they arrived at ablain without accident	278.2775
he still felt the same selfsatisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a nights rest	137.8363
i say i am entirely of porthoss opinion replied aramis	289.5771
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched francs then these francs said mercédès shuddering	232.1870
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	101.0328
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m	312.0539
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed	208.4387
i know it and the duke put the quill to the paper	92.1478
but after he had gone about two hundred steps dartagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddlebow to fasten them to his girdle	142.5253
arrived in london you will seek buckingham i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity	246.6238
athos examined it and became very pale	85.4064
what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous	237.6432
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead	193.3895
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	1368.6570
dartagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men	195.7605
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening	51.1514
the count of monte cristo i believe said he	61.4224
de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family	93.2874
john felton i trust your word john felton i put faith in your loyalty my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance	170.3674
buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love	265.3206
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	72.1344
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voiceso trifling indeed that dartagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man	163.3207
now if you will come on board m	170.4936
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were	38.4132
monsieur de bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last monththat is since paris had been besiegedhe was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay	152.9864
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants	117.0001
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	95.3205
i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject	81.6857
dartagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends	120.4498
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again	134.1404
and you go into that house cried he briskly	1532.0464
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil	127.9834
from this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous	259.6832
draw up this note for us aramis but by our holy father the pope cut it short for i shall prune you in my turn i warn you i ask no better said aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the subject	129.7186
de saintméran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	193.3306
we did not see her monseigneur said athos	139.6694
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed	223.1403
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the dukes finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him	159.8855
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended	171.8825
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him	370.2145
the light of day reassured me i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow	192.5544
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive	295.8062
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count	51.6535
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived monsieur you insult the majesty of justice not at all said athos calmly	173.6059
as you will replied the duke	55.0343
broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings officers	276.8240
madame de saintméran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m	80.2359
well said caderousse why what a lie he told he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city	94.3953
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil	377.0209
for heavens sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me	174.5392
he leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon	112.1386
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose	106.3416
there only they explained to them the matter in hand	83.8524
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	216.5887
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell	192.4110
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian there were the large dark melting eyes the finely formed nose the coral lips and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and country	590.9554
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m	136.5412
a bottle perhaps a whole bottle	675.7610
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a drought come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration	211.0985
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray horse	287.8322
it was time for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee	437.7166
disguised as a coachman exclaimed mazarin	100.0374
so dartagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarins nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists adieu then and dartagnan poured out a glass of wine	200.4123
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	108.7697
we will explain in a few words how dartagnan had been led to choose that place of residence	138.3815
only imagine what happiness that would afford me	67.1926
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone	36.9087
he is really king of paris he cant go out without being mobbed by his admirers ah so much the better can we have the honor of seeing his highness i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on	188.7986
danglars is a moneylover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel	145.4027
the counts tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune	157.8549
the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea	181.2163
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion	288.3677
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	275.1476
i will now go up into my apartment	181.7641
we have met him twice at general cromwells	486.9186
nor i nor i chorused the sailors	64.2089
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune	303.5832
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian	1796.6226
what has just happened yes said the count you are rightit is miraculous for albert is brave resumed morrel	186.6886
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed	357.3147
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them	83.6663
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	115.1227
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice	63.2372
either you are a demon continued felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a monster	5643.1567
aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard	171.8437
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look	128.1100
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking	90.1468
ah dear dartagnan see how regularly i live and how easy i am here	146.3023
