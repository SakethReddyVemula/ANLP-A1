in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at	69.7619
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him	80.1152
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object	110.4927

from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts	103.4188

the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for	186.7673
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	104.9757

in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed	165.3560
and my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen i expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him gave him cried dartagnan	60.8411
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage i shall pass all my life thought dartagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct	140.4462
porthos had his fits	280.6986
fire then said athos	34.7482
oh oh that is a large sum	55.9050

so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone no my lord replied the impassive young man your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me in that case my brave lieutenant let us leave milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing	154.2552
am i to put this construction on your visit yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny wait a momentno threats if you please m	154.4637
you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care dartagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drillsergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding four men and an escort a carriage and a horse five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard	83.5948
dartagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name	89.7039
it was necessary to reach m	55.9170
friend dartagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future	108.3387

i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures the stone seems very brilliant answered the count	116.7262
de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to ones country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them beauchamp was thunderstruck	160.6940
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto	77.0757
impossible go on go on my dear fellow said dartagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each you are laughing at me and want to try me said dartagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the _iliad_	127.9361
a carriage was in waiting	110.0616
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father	65.4657
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris	171.1710
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed how so asked beauchamp	94.7838
scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation	193.1999
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	108.2402
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them	195.6977
he has slain his uncle he murmured	222.7490
i am parched with thirst	207.7404
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	166.8518
you understand my dear girl continued dartagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in oh my god you remind me of my fright if he should have known me again how	75.0764
no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back	106.3707
take it then and pray disturb us no longer said madame de villefort giving the album to edward who then went towards the door led by his mother	76.1618
i dont know what it was	26.2785
give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge	127.9916
i will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family it would have been so unquestionably had not god given me so large a compensation	115.8932
bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air	239.7883
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man	43.8317
speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise the queen said dartagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended	100.4174
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival	109.2612
are they made to order precisely said the count six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness	232.4354
why an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	54.5410
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling	104.0041
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word	112.2264
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck	92.9736
it contained my fortune bills upon spain asked the disturbed host	498.4019
one of the culprits will be _mazzolato_ he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity	112.1136
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heartstrings	153.1010
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined	191.7028
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	59.5337
constance replied the young man where are you	17.6876
morrel thats the whole truth on the honor of a sailor is not it true you fellows there a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings	205.9768
if we stay here five minutes more theres an end of us yes you are right but where shall we go asked porthos	92.6575
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness	72.9256
oliver cromwell	1039.2660
oh no edmond it is myself that i blame myself that i hate oh miserable creature that i am cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven	89.3720
the guests chapter	295.0141
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom you say either too much or too little speak madame	448.6102
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three	151.2151
on perceiving the count he rose quickly	67.6969
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelleenserval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	75.1535
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m	69.3728
and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased	75.0844
cromwell gazed a moment after him	152.5612
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot	131.9868
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column	121.2853
dartagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last dartagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe	78.2581
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated	307.0085
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair	102.4433
listen said he just now i told you it was of m	46.6298
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else the devil all this is very sad which you tell me what will you	59.0498
that was dartagnans road as he was going to the louvre	59.1626
this measure somewhat reassured bonacieux	2976.3093
valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the doorbell	110.8690
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at dartagnan who was riding toward him at full speed	111.2624
i can discover and explain to you my grandfathers thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject	128.2592
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	95.2528
monsieur porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left good said aramis taking a purse which bazin presented to him	87.2637
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle there was no one like him for that and now replied dartagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	93.3455
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter	106.6466
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	109.8828
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	152.3662
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible	93.5642
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars	149.9931
mazarin came within three steps of dartagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place	114.4697
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	227.5806
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton	164.0246
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i cannot comprehend indeed yes well then tell him this rochefort	156.7085
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed	75.3055
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone	87.6078
this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false positionplaced between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birdswas in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a womans caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest	142.1587
father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	78.5722
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this nightbut supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother	206.1251
i have seen the bastille	35.5809
monte cristo was not deceived	18.2632
yes said he at length it is so	29.1734
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and châteaurenaud	112.8979
that is all i require	40.9189
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz dépinay	293.9309
port wine	7844.0103
ah my dear fellow excuse me i am lodged like a chartreux	66.2338
did you see him they all asked	81.5811
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	115.8559
and now my dear child adieu for the present	54.0705
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid allwere it my life oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments i also have had dreams	191.3185
and yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish	213.2928
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite	225.2823
the first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion it will be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other i thank you for the warning said the count i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions you will then come on saturday yes since madame de morcerf invites me you are very kind will m	60.6049
for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse	213.6363
the thirtytwo that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses you see i travel with them but you are not always travelling when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects count may i suggest one idea to you certainly it is that next to you	140.9344
bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession then he must be a wonder	83.4872
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth i consider it lost well then i will buy it of you you yes i but at a tremendous discount of course no for two hundred thousand francs	102.9850
well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened	61.3811
he told melet me thinkwhat was it	152.2548
here said she you see i have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold but you oh i am never cold you know besides with these mens clothes will you dress here certainly shall you have time do not be uneasy you little coward all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair	162.1701
bonacieux dead and dartagnan in a swoon	176.4252
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès	212.8528
so i think and therefore i said were our object money only but we want something else replied the gascon	176.0282
well said athos	12.1202
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell	307.2442
she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion	65.8804
what ails you my dearest father	77.5167
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover	126.7079
ah _pardieu_ said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper	61.2186
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	38.4275
m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	117.7252
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started	64.6498
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men	120.4182
well bring it said athos	143.4272
no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	117.7748
de morcerf he sent us word this morning replied châteaurenaud that he would meet us on the ground ah said morrel	85.2072
de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly and de tréville as you know is one of the queens greatest friends	92.9400
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money m mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference	188.3248
caderousse became thoughtful	405.7083
my god i know that i suffer thats all	74.9250
a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriagedrive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers	135.5645
to one in edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value	335.5083
who has displeased you	123.1945
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee	73.8748
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might failfor felton was forewarned and that against the least chance	152.8833
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well	74.2670
disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart	123.7206
yes shall my father be informed of your wish yes do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately yes then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa	97.7024
you have one second to decide said he	182.2220
dartagnan determined upon his course	279.1106
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime who said it was a crime asked villefort with a last effort	97.3521

more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her	217.8941

the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rosetrees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season	113.3546
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously	207.0583
sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duckanddrake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz	184.8509
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step	134.4793
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	71.3637
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said andrea	132.6637
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people	70.8891
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again	235.4734
chapter xxxv	275.6395
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the kings attorney and thats all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke	144.5037
de tréville at a distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you	122.7073

wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here diamond exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about why did you not hear all we said inquired caderousse	139.2624
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i cannot understand how any man can really love her the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison no but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	114.8617
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate dartagnan drew up his request and m	139.4298
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me i do better than that siri save you you do	62.8397
the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them no but we shall make use of them said dartagnan	85.5935

he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	73.7608
the count came towards him	44.0968
oh the devil said porthos i am sorry for that it would have been one language more when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded ah really said dartagnan these people are very ingenious	106.6288

ten minutes later the curate of st sulpice was announced	35.1681
the officer desired to have miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat	71.1998

the same expression continued	748.3707
de villefort talking to m	167.9900
dartagnan did the same	68.9776
but i doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the holy sepulchre you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	179.6296
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy	136.1585
bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their way	100.9742
edward he stammerededward the child did not answer	102.6161
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see dartagnan	127.7463
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him	111.5650
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	52.5054
bonacieux	nan
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreignersscotch irish or danish	149.2516
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	129.6181
thomson french inquired the stranger	168.8763
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	46.5505
perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me art thou happy friend asked dartagnan	239.2959
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence	158.4147
while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner but the ink said dantès of what did you make your ink there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison	149.5876
the house to which dartagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening	90.8266
stop said albert here he comes	59.6024
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume	126.2237
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court	85.0907
noirtiers eye still retained its inanimate expression	516.0418
at last he heard the voice of la ramee	30.8531
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot	136.4988
at these words he gave me a ring	54.4632
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity	291.5336
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied	139.3317
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one	245.6126
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey	127.0001
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of dartagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever	75.8903
the apartment of m	70.5046
danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifes this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france	106.5606

morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	244.7558
m	nan
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have but what the devil you are not a priest you are a musketeer a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me	104.8107
coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey	103.1710
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to dartagnan	111.2110
an envoy of the duke of buckingham named montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the german empire spain england and lorraine	203.4385
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here madame those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been for they are the agents of the cardinal and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille my husband in the bastille cried mme	117.3430
dartagnan but that till that hour he had been at m	119.1643

of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow	193.3687
dartagnan was worn out with fatigue	89.6879
ah ah a bruise yes i think i received a flowerpot upon my head brutes said dartagnan	81.1631
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity	98.9597
he threw himself upon it and fell asleep	86.9916
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain	152.1567
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress	42.6741
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark	116.9558
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio	96.2673
it is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting	137.2831
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance	102.9019
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines	217.7271
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of dartagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated	87.7142
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	173.1979
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one cannot incline ones self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi	272.7451
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it	116.4488
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent	79.9460
another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to the ground covered with blood and almost fainting	95.8892
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend	127.1402

the host opened	95.6005
i obey my captains orders	808.6929
but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	72.7166
and nothing more	1005.6575
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dantès efforts	1757.5001
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more who i am madame	113.6081
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her handas i now do at your entreaty	145.7771
the journey at two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st denis	92.5354
the catalans beyond a bare weatherworn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans	102.9585
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba	112.2164
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion	327.4109
no one had entered the house since i had left it	52.0016
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	128.2659
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was dartagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping aramis shook his head	138.8945
noirtiertry noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself	147.9030
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated châteaurenaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other	190.3831

certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocketbook	75.0604
morrel had not readily given up the fight	234.2914
it turned out as dartagnan had foreseen	91.1460

the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him	103.3030
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so everything answered franzyour voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead ii live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha	269.5871

there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	149.6350

de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain and said villefort is it at your house in the champsélysées that you receive your visitors no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritoriousit is in the country in the country yes where is it then	89.2422

it is five hundred feet from here in advance said dartagnan	116.3031
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily the friends embraced	386.8335
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	72.1156
if you had only to deal with four men dartagnan i would allow you to go alone	65.6316
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twentyfive and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	198.1328
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing	122.1002
the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	94.1794

edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration	149.9121
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey	31.5891
monsieur said m	59.8638
but what must i do asked milady	57.1397
well thought dartagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my faultfor it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him	109.1396
m	nan
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy	118.2874
by eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos	19.2159
they will be ten times worse off in a week ah yes good heavens i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen	101.0672
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	97.1146
m	nan
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape	238.1547
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	67.2544
in case any evil should happen to me said bragelonne	146.5453
let me see your plan i dare say it is a pretty one why not	60.1106
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air	70.5465

franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arminarm with the peasant girl	215.1626
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him	72.9769
alas yes said caderousse very uneasily	91.4061
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track	263.8956
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	71.2524
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position	111.5068
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andreas intrigues	112.7751
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man	63.2850
grimaud bowed but stepped back	284.1908
benedetto he muttered fatality halfpast six oclock has just struck m	608.7554

take my advice and set out this evening impossible monsieur you have given your word then yes monsieur ah thats quite another thing but promise me if you should not be killed tonight that you will go tomorrow i promise it do you need money i have still fifty pistoles	103.0240
he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness	75.0053
they were thus perpetually employedfaria that he might not see himself grow old dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night	231.0357
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of illhumor which dartagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail	149.7395
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	58.0461
have you not happy rogue that you arehave you not your duchess who cannot fail to come to your aid well you see my dear dartagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world	76.0630
m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	107.0932
yes he said	12.5916
one said the gravediggers two three and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	142.1674
the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her	67.7766
miladys secret chapter xxxviii	221.1330
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap	54.1461
singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocketbook	155.5085
noirtier he then returned to his place but did not sit down	55.1126
i might have suspected he was poisoning us and you see you would have been deceived yes doubtless but believe me that man has other projects	122.7055
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself	131.6272
noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle	149.0070
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity	106.4455
comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story	64.0245

the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner	43.0275
then he resumed in his turn discipline monseigneur has i hope in no way been forgotten by us	268.7958
you see i am a good sort of a man do not jest about holy things my friend go on then i listen i had been at the seminary from nine years old in three days i should have been twenty	76.2778
it is a false diamond said caderousse	60.7177
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	35.6830
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word	108.3540
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore	77.2742
he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself	100.2508
meantime dartagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword	83.1546
albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe	73.6321
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took	200.9540
the trial at eight oclock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamps door	79.0331
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last i dont know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord	69.7836
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections	220.9995
i dont understand said porthos	62.2566
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	103.5785
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do	166.9266
i will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors	97.0345
how would you like to have it	53.4622
i expected him this morning he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle yes i know that said buckingham he has a prisoner it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied felton	77.5694
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow	206.4618
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monkof a man who resembles an echorepeating simply what he hears	115.3312
yes replied the old man	13.4783
they set out after a run of two leagues mousquetons horse sank	251.6775
bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to monsieur replied bertuccio it leads to the garden and pray how do you know that it ought to do so at least well let us be sure of that bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden	78.4336
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	78.3555
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned unquestionably so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time precisely m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman	135.0338
let us sit down to supper	52.7174
one passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition	117.0212
i am repulsed on all sides what it is so indeed mademoiselle eugénie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle darmilly her confidant does not speak to me at all but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo	98.6129
well tempter what more do you want with me said dartagnan	59.9515
or mme	5041.0400
franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it	73.3278
no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almightys pleasure dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbés plans	124.2045
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m	253.0572
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive	212.7964
listen captain baldi theres one way of settling this said jacopo	780.6778
dartagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young mans death would be placed to the account of the enemy	42.4188
he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited	96.5347
hollo whats the matter at the château dif said the captain	29.0365
but stop i can manage your business for you	109.1027
have you not yet divined who he is what cried felton heagain healways he	139.2947
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists	298.3582
and madame danglars and m	57.2111
as dartagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer	81.3026
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also	92.4608
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed	235.3790
yes said albert blushing	52.3901
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you	81.4526
i require the proof of a preengagement	90.5952
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain	100.7809
i suppose you mean continued dartagnan	71.7037
i will bless youi i am dying cried mordaunt come to me come to me dartagnan began to be touched	81.7487
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said dartagnan if you persist in offering him a civility	86.4211
at the first words of the count de guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything	164.2286
do you mean at rome i do ah then i suppose you heard haydées guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie	152.3322
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht and she beckoned him towards them	86.0342
he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey	332.7996
chapter lxiii	77.4922
let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts and then your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again i understand said the duke	98.7464
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london and as to my other instructions asked the fair traveler	149.4233
to the installation of my rival at m	70.1523
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you cannot well mistake him he will enter by this door	160.3997
has he gone intending not to return undoubtedlyat ten oclock at night his horses took him to the barrier of charenton there a postchaise was waiting for himhe entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau then what did you mean stayhe left a letter for me a letter yes read it and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray	91.6434
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with travellers	59.3917
you saw the person repeated the young girl	55.8587
a letter from charles the first	118.3909
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks	142.8761
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand	99.8966
it was three oclock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of francs	112.7852
there to his great astonishment dartagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into	160.8267
the count stopped on seeing the young man	27.5181
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her	102.1119
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	165.1346
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the infanta for king charles i who was then only prince of wales	152.0588
his musketeers proceeded and followed him	95.0492
did you ever see her furious no said athos	93.2614
thanks for your devotedness gentlemen	137.4126
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	210.7264
but is this all that is known they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him on his track said villefort	94.1815
are you not the captain fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali	266.1276
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	71.7549
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately	113.4339
m	nan
monsieur mordaunt tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from aramis so there is said dartagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying dartagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge	119.2359
in the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded	117.9677
what a wrist you have reverend sir said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist silence god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that god i actremember that wretchand to spare thee at this moment is still serving him oh said caderousse groaning with pain	158.2778
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	51.3990
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner rapid as had been villeforts glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	136.6118
de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france	71.5627
loose halfdrunk imposing the kings musketeers or rather m	188.4545
m she then turned towards the avenue	64.5646
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper	246.0768
then dartagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers	52.7579
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto dartagnans	91.7677
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer	78.7278
have the goodness to send mine to athoss residence	136.4329
see paragraph below	2192.3660
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes	284.2571
he swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness	173.0415
i am monsieur dartagnan a gascon gentleman serving in the kings musketeers	220.2628
but you sent for me my dear child	43.2930
de bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard yes said athos and the marechal has often told me so himself then it was so murmured winter and the next day henry iv	140.6212
she has met mademoiselle de villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis	125.9296
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other	237.2890
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement	158.0768
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	66.8652
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety	168.7247
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillons graces but the forearm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed	182.6119
the story first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise what is that inquired the abbé	91.9232
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence	114.3108
chapter xxv	50.8403
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv	140.1450
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day	78.2505
well i must mortify myself	131.5871
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle	134.3022
no madame replied monte cristo but you see i make no resistance we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove the count looked at mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking	52.0828
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedi care very little about that i dont know him	63.9601
beauchamp that you are more sober than he was sir said m	83.3446
good thought dartagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable	78.2028
he was young he had an old father whom he loved a betrothed bride whom he adored	171.0698
progress of cavalcanti the younger meanwhile m	281.9058
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the rapier nor i either so much the better that sets my mind at rest	102.3739
let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence	144.9949
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied eugénie	319.2065
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger	67.7469
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is god m above us all sir was monte cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered	181.4716
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	112.3928
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	74.7297
is that your opinion dherblay yes said aramis we have promised then continued athos we have another reason it is thislisten in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry	106.7784
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	36.2965
how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz	209.6304
rinse the glasses said grimaud	85.1063
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned	139.7198
as he passed by m	82.3382
i hoped to be able to rely upon that and i madame said dartagnan embarrassed you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way dartagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme	139.4988
goodday monsieur dulaurier replied dartagnan	78.8941
i have charged myself with this affair	59.3644
you tell me of m	57.5227
now said he the sacrifice is consummated ah if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husbands chest m	124.1848
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchengarden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation	246.3293
i repeat to you i dont know her why she is the old wife of a procurator of the châtelet monsieur named madame coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous airs	173.5417
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him	47.3753
but on my soul it looks so	281.7143
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still	91.8057
but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading	91.8180
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him	65.2878
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini	82.8031
ah cried dartagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it well merit this pretended happiness then i am at your orders said dartagnan	99.4567
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be anothers turn and so onprovided a single one arrives that is all that is required bravo dartagnan your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent i am going to take the waters you will accompany me	80.5591
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous tone	254.9917
the generation who follow us are very precocious come beauchamp said châteaurenaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us	94.3746
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room	151.5011
monte cristo felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of wood	67.9521
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried _portières_	61.0824
preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags	250.1865
then dantès departed for genoa	792.0775
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered	207.0391
i went too but as i was older than fernand and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast	107.7251
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king	62.7374
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday	62.8106
well said caderousse why dont you come	55.3233
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her dartagnan then related the poisoning of mme	222.8065
i misunderstood you	147.4786
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you	85.1996
gentlemen thus dartagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him	178.3154
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might you are perfectly right my lord you think so	104.9572
dartagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he dartagnan and his friend had rendered to the queens party in the morning	92.5093
he looked at dartagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them	77.0925
zaccone ah indeed and when a child i often played with the son in the timberyards but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or	121.9305
rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count	88.8780
dartagnan obeyed	367.3303
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am well said comminges suppose one thing i will suppose anything you please suppose there were a window in this wall well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his the count then is in the chateau yes for what reason the same as yourself athosa prisoner you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison dont let us play upon words sir	137.5359
he came down into the kitchen where your doublet was	73.3377
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	94.5200
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow	85.3580
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by email within days of receipt that she does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg license	35.1183
they passed the barrier without accident	254.0192
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saintméran arose from her pillow	108.0791
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends	189.2734
did he speak in your hearing	116.2039
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical	176.3205
m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young mens minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld	192.2007
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship	147.8667
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript yes yes repeated the major yesthereisapostscript in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of francs which you still owe me the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	126.9676
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror	82.8409
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary	141.7654
the citizen followed him	117.4074
and the queen what queen madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv she is at the louvre as you know yes and i hear in bitter poverty	149.3100
the young girl did not speak but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her fathers breast	60.1447
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood	178.1676
ja replied the gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue	86.4038
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room	128.3029
are you satisfied sir there is one thing the queen has not signedher assent to the treaty of what use today	74.7564
dartagnan was perplexed	267.8968
he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart	113.6397
when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door	86.3128
adieu then and be of good courage said athos	131.2716
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force	209.9167
the favorite of two kings immensely rich allpowerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity	195.8378
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination	134.9700
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door	64.4637
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept	116.7098
ten days passed away thus	134.8832
im not the man you take me for you are in captain rogerss post are you not	61.7303
today yes bless me i quite forgot the races	462.6187
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of heramorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her	118.0602
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	54.4190
the richest turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easychairs and sofas offered their highpiled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment	300.0158
at all events if you want me remember the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette and i shall be at the convent of jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door	95.0087
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	91.4016
i always said that dartagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which dartagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence	127.3865
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spotthe appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening	191.0919
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair	83.0387
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study	96.6679
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i dont believe in them the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemenan affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained how is that cried porthos and aramis in a breath	142.2845
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized	110.8727
de saintméran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying	65.7205
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity	63.1365
well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her workroom and by whom was your wife abducted i know nothing surely monsieur but i suspect someone and who is the person whom you suspect a man who has pursued her a long time the devil but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this less love than politics replied dartagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect monsieur i beg you to observe that i ask you absolutely nothing	75.3343
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costumea ball costume doubtlessbecomes her admirably ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this	170.1652
they stamped upon the carpet with their feet they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might	125.7920
and sincei do not give it said the musketeer	54.0237
ah confound it yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling	160.3085
and madame de villefortcharming peoplem	131.0464
yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it	84.9915
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs	43.4952
let us go immediately they sent for a cabriolet	133.0740
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation	168.9795
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	205.8780
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the barons equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle	104.5002
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m	87.1364
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	305.8019
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead	90.5015
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass dartagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m	99.4157
seven oclock had just struck and m	102.6287
afraid of making any inquiries at this house dartagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	69.5608
i not only permit i desire let them come in the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	158.3138
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him	67.2959
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant	338.2339
i suspected where she was concealed	388.4835
i hope i am not the cause hush said andrea	83.6863
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy	226.0221
de blacas will go and find my messenger wait sir wait said louis xviii	129.4670
we are friends are we not she asked	119.9966
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii	157.6280
well i shall write to the abbé i shall hold him responsible for his _protégés_ misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination	73.4229
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me i thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away i do not send you away but you have had the smallpox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace today to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion sire interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle to any one laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except mancini now mancini was a nephew of mazarins and was as much hated by	122.1917
louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister	203.0436
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	133.8179
let the man go dartagnan let us save the woman monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat eh monsieur eh friend said dartagnan a halfpistole for that paper my faith monsieur with great pleasure here it is the hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the yard	165.3126
the joy of the king was lively	61.0020
those in whom the king has confidedlord levens highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once	100.9619
ah that is really original said beauchamp	141.1354
italy sinbad the sailor chapter	231.7169
jesus seigneur	1692.5950
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse you know resumed dartagnan that she has had leave to return to france yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice oh this time returned aramis i havent seen her she is much changed in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance	134.1619
there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi were the following lines which i can never forget the great wars of romagna had ended cæsar borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all italy	205.2253
the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dantès	170.8271
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter	46.4520
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor	115.7696
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight	170.2043
do you possess francs inquired the notary	87.8606
the accusation no the letter are you sure i saw it done that alters the case	169.3805
he then concluded it must be an assassin	120.6807
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris	208.7632
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	136.6767
let us strive i beseech youlet us strive to be cheerful yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind	118.3131
have you any other guests in your house inquired he	74.7462
you then served louis xviii and you did not show any favorit was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect himit is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself	163.1938
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it	55.1351
what is this asked the captain	41.8438
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors	170.8811
yes the porter my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house well the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise by whom by thieves you are a fool m	113.9628
what story can i invent	800.6324
it was danglars letter to the kings attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m	54.7862
but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death	153.6665
well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in gods sight	264.3898
shall i knock hush replied dartagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window do you hear nothing whispered planchet	252.9666
i had chosen this texttell me dear dartagnan if it is not to your taste_non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_ that is a little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord stop there cried the jesuit for that thesis touches closely upon heresy	143.1945
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad hashish statuesall became a dream for franz	172.5063
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	108.6859
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone	152.5621
morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance	158.4564
they shook their heads	520.6608
you see it is yourself who have first named heryou her father have pity on valentine listen it is impossible	154.3167
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman the sailor departed without reply	236.5282
bonacieux expected him	183.7569
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen	144.2793
m	nan
m	nan
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty	217.5426
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion	105.7857
de monte cristo have you not i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine well in one of your late conversations with him you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not i did say so well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score danglars did not answer	102.8764
i have always said to you i love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is anothers is not this true fernand yes that is very true mercédès replied the young man yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry m you mistake fernand it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor	90.3444
the departure chapter	172.0617
de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions	54.6536
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died	68.3123
at the outer door the steward paused	90.7894
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow	88.7393
chapter lxx	250.9620
oh death is in my house cried villefort	119.9514
whilst this scene was going on dartagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze	152.2643
when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze	206.0198
it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map yes sir replied the count i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individualsa physiological study	191.4943
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger	81.6435
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine	145.3512
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister	230.7773
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peters and a month to study it	69.4834
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children do you think so indeed i do and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel and is she gone the other night she left with madame danglars no with a relation	173.8542
but there the confidence of dartagnan stopped	96.7087
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that	117.7453
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain	238.8434
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	216.6334
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair	144.5955
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion	131.6305
dartagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now dont you think monsieur that woods are like churches how so planchet because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other but why did you not dare to speak aloud planchetbecause you are afraid afraid of being heard	119.8336
my good charles i particularly recommend to your care planchet the laquais of monsieur dartagnan	231.2414
no dartagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time	164.7029

you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay	139.8739
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen	112.7055
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans	570.1949
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	146.5183

de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art	93.9202

mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreignerwell he would be more justly estimated	88.0019
the steward attempted to expostulate	276.4231
besides it has perhaps been her majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly	233.7061
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me shall you not go with the queen no replied mazarin	72.8214

then he must be playing in the garden go and see m no sir madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since a cold perspiration burst out on villeforts brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch	99.1383
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years	76.6078
de villeforts marginal notes	224.3172
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him	40.1926

_parbleu_ at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day it is not that which deterred me replied monte cristo but as i determined to have a house to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris said beauchamp	76.7691
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	121.9854
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride	224.8569
he said nothing but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me	108.7560
morrel at his death left francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children	272.5565
oh not the least in the world madame my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentines cheeks	153.1913
the sudden extinction of the _moccoletti_ the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franzs mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness	81.9600
they descended into the plain by the ladder	128.2971
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived	203.1429
you know one cannot change his nature he said	233.5527
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour	83.4526
oh i _will_ find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i _will_ find him though i dig forever monte cristo drew back in horror	123.2292
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds aramis porthos cried athos and laughed aloud	270.1096
no replied dartagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people cannot see whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion chastised monsieur said dartagnan the expression is strong it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face ah _pardieu_ i know full well that you dont turn your back to yours and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly	136.7494
mouston asked dartagnan	44.3785
just so	139.7238
morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow	127.5819
the answer known he had yielded to alberts wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydées recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerfs father	123.7038

her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his firstrate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife	175.4352
at the language you use what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling	120.8799
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs	72.3575
de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient gentlemen said châteaurenaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is franz and debray the two young men he announced were indeed approaching	125.0485
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil _rue du helder on the_ _st may halfpast ten_ chapter	164.7048
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed	157.7599
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a masters hand mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain	155.7353
but then your word is given yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not	66.5455
de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemys camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action	118.4305
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution	107.4867
gods blood cried the officer have they killed him	169.3724
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king on the contrary i am certain he will do so	75.1763
pay and eat and what am i to pay with brute said danglars enraged	294.1925
a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry	58.2614

oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad yes yes i replied he	114.2835
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person	80.8055
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it byi saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse	166.2183
what could be the good of that	64.2173
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air	155.8176
dartagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply	43.4611

giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency giovanni obeyed	335.6891
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	146.9020
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him	96.4964
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	88.6164
had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot villeforts father laughed	275.8300
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children	137.1346
in fact her position was terrible	142.8607
what are you doing cried kitty	39.1916
why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief why did you so awkwardly let it fall i have said monsieur and i repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for i saw it fall ah you take it with that tone do you master gascon	134.5691
the slave of the count of monte cristo why it is a rank of itself in france and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year a hundred thousand francs the poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the _thousand and one nights_ would seem but poverty she must be a princess then you are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too i thought so	71.7577
the procureur exerted himself to reply	122.8741
and is the reason known no how extraordinary and how does m	382.6235
morrel replied villefort	85.7853
he had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial	275.7969
and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will dothat will do monsieur bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements	231.7024
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances	157.1745
dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament impossible and executed in our presence what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me monsieur de flamarens yes he has just gone out athos smiled	160.4933
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	119.2475
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object	393.7821
nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage	212.5499
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	236.2632
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of illlooking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache	149.0252
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of lechelle ten oclock struck	71.2249
this itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up	159.2958
would you have given up the letter aramis said dartagnan	38.0806

you never come to me without conferring pleasure	129.2954
de boville the inspector of prisons no rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned	161.0410
after a moments mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears	111.7861
before his departure the count went to haydées apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care	127.4766
they are no longer sure planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton	95.9841
andrea cavalcanti your italian prince not so fast m	812.7389
the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port m my dear friends said morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven impossible impossible but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receiptedthe splendid diamond	165.0265
i must know what you mean to do said she	36.1480
the mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m	92.0225
de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background bah you are wrong	116.5897
however scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor reentered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there louis xviiis halffilled snuffboxscarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	194.5443
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich and to have ideas added madame danglars	89.3434
ever since valentines dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad	222.6186
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table	63.7661
i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company ah my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again	170.2716

i waited for him until this hour replied franz	175.6246
sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and dont kill me unheard	65.9514
no false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos	141.4320
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembersand beholda proof as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours what for me only cried caderousse ah sir do not jest with me this diamond was to have been shared among his friends	123.6891
for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice	116.3972
you are in prison then rochefort trembled in every limb at this question	180.8078
thats more time than we want	142.1257
i cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old _podestàs_ these ancient _condottieri_for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provincesmy opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation	102.8892
to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house	154.6284
it is almost dinnertime and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my toodevoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which i am in a fair way never to get done	146.7953
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible	81.0747
and i also said franz	99.5749

a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly dartagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	260.5640
dartagnan started on seeing these tears	199.8003
in order to make ones way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman	140.6137
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and reentered the hotel	175.1573
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	152.6054

athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	139.0844

danglars informed you of the ceremony oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety well said monte cristo you are fortunate m	94.4149
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father hasat least i hope soabjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and ordera better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction having made this wellturned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court	163.8239
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant	75.8606
i have done and dartagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis	32.5943

he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	99.5361
franz dépinay	326.9741
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the _pharaon_ is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars	135.9996

the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder	35.9042
the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant	149.5074
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	117.1558

morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly	89.4463
sure enough said the general	94.9678
he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation	129.5632
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight	96.0762
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall	38.4193

all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m	151.3268

only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning	127.4523

on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers	142.5925
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars	96.1459
he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès	71.4863
but i must not forget one grand point which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense i have indeed by circumstances no by you by me	191.0938
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you	91.5571
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	102.8178
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle and when i was removed to the château dif i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again with what with this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantès a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained	114.9329

when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan	45.4735
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love	77.0938
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not mordaunt replied by trying his opponents weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest	184.6211

danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another halfhour which appeared to him like a century	128.3159
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment	76.7649
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	148.7859

de villefort yes sire and he comes from marseilles in person why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	107.3430
dartagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life	96.5078

a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there	322.2987

bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of châteaurenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	132.4779

ah it is no then yes valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old mans eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns	127.5018
his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever his brow was more pale than it generally was his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him	179.9085
oh mercy mercy monsieur what i require is that justice be done	558.2379

grimaud moved as if to leave the room	65.0369
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three oclock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight	123.5539

what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily bravo porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged do you think so i am sure of it then i would kill him rather than let him go and you would act rightly	91.2607
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give you dartagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	113.1651
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing	232.5195

a bed of dried grass covered with goatskins was placed in one corner	142.1611

then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure	89.7897

the perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint	66.4398
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight	150.4239
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half	105.2863
at this moment grimaud came in	29.1497
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	230.9281
is he living patience monseigneur we are coming to it	250.9515
m theres nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose	216.2451
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved dartagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man	102.8572
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair	167.3800

why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual	219.8417
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it	130.1378
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated	104.3125
debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it	70.4932

milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years	104.9020
we must let monsieur de beaufort come in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de condé had arrived	71.2952

well cried porthos	38.8822
de tréville who held out his hand to him dartagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude	55.3711
the tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage	127.4277
he was quite prepared for any such encounter	201.0836
my lord said dartagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation	187.3225
everyone therefore ran to the court some to witness the sight others to comment upon it	205.2013
stop a moment cried dartagnan pray how many men have you on board captain i dont understand was the reply	200.1508
charles smiled	140.5686

quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal	48.6145
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againa face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed m the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantès then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligiblehome home the fresh air	189.1349
and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived	181.0056
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the bankers shoulder people pay here before they eat	156.8554

on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saintméran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentines mother	231.1375
dartagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme	117.8627
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said dartagnan	114.6162
mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent	68.2906
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you you pardon me cried dartagnan	85.6228
dartagnan then only halflied which is lying but little when he said that by going in search of milady he at the same time went in search of constance	115.2999
m	nan
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool	81.9750

my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose	106.6253
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms	55.2290
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra	197.4599
why should you meddle with what does not concern you the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation	103.9437
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow	87.5379
oh it is impossibleyou must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve	163.8837
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up	101.6613
then he began to search	42.3424
this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimneyboard which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left	124.9833
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them the scotch inquired winter	300.9900
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation i did not sleep well you raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said athos	91.8353

_ma foi_ i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellowcreatures	92.6680
i will give you three replied the stranger	76.3275
the host desired himself to serve him which dartagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation	208.6929
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions	214.6555
now then what had i better do return instantly	458.0437

that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so there was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling	88.1193
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe	170.0339

then he mentally addedstill my unknown protector i am not forgotten	177.3276
he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome	97.4514
the demands in that programme must be granted we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling	175.0863
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat	175.5486
while he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail the boat was now moving with the wind	83.7664
i seemed to be going mad	147.6290
ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca	138.1459
de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed	41.4137
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter	52.2888
do you know she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us m who is he whom do you mean the gentleman who receives us	65.7520
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m	100.8786

groslow began turning the cards one after another	486.4939

the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings	296.0989
at the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	104.9607
dartagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them	219.8654
answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience kings musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so	96.5542
monsieur said the cardinal are you a dartagnan from béarn yes monseigneur replied the young man	70.3697
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder well now that will do wonderfully well said athos	161.8781
he glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement	683.0682
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your motherinlaw madame de saintméran heard her	73.3740
courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of la pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence	129.2602
they were innumerable	227.1602
and then hea wanderer on the earth a man without fortune a man without family a soldier accustomed to inns cabarets taverns and restaurants a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treatswas about to partake of family meals to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is the more they please as old soldiers say	175.6450

it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten days	68.8125
neither was it as with our neighbors the english an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the year	183.6047
display is not becoming to everyone m	345.6060
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms	185.4315
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of dartagnan and of athos it must be the best but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison egad cried dartagnan hes just the man i count upon	111.3431
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head	99.9082
well answered the boy the thing is done where is he gone the halfpistole is for me doubtless answer me i want to see it	111.6041

besides the end justified the means as you frenchmen say does it not yes my lord i accept them said dartagnan and if it please god we will make a good use of your presents well now your hand young man	133.0559
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him	69.5000
why do we love	74.1998
by whom by the gentleman who was here yesterday	131.8555
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress	171.0987
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinals bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched	135.1119
sdeath i would die willingly for the king but supposing i happened to be killed on account of mazarin as your nephew came near being today there could be nothing in paradise however well placed i might be there that could console me for it well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty	161.5362
_ma foi_ yes though he was in his own element what do you mean the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists great is truth muttered the count fire cannot burn nor water drown it thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimneycorner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir	153.0280
said the concierge	61.8117
are there not some latin verses upon that subject	405.6060
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	136.6006
although of a paleness that was almost livid this man had a remarkably handsome face his eyes were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them	162.1928
de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly	126.5100
i was passing close to the door of the captains cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me danglars reflected for a moment	55.2004
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	83.6076
danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side	110.8627
the first movement of dartagnan was to return it but milady added no no keep that ring for love of me	151.0858
where is the child villefort shrugged his shoulders	72.4841
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the haltingplaces of the wandering visitors of monte cristo	46.5385
no madame the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes	335.1151
repassed the bidassoa	68.0715
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money	114.6382
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortuneupon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be	156.6343
they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur darminges	96.8672

dartagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de trévilles place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey well i am in a maze said porthos do _you_ approve of what dartagnan has done _parbleu_ indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it and now gentlemen said dartagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for allthat is our motto is it not and yet said porthos	89.0288

he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners	93.9803
dartagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed	221.8786
you must be cruelly bored here that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you whats that it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventyfive pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice	90.8455
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart	98.1295
meanwhile what are you going to do i yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true	82.0550
to purchase back my liberty said the cardinal	125.3666

its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of francs i will not say granted but offered me three months	118.8385

if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you but inquired dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves no no be easy on that score the family is extinct	203.3264
well now listen we are listening it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him	177.1044
dantès raised his head and saw farias eyes injected with blood	82.6709
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl	90.7997
i am temporarily commander of the _pharaon_ with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue	144.2118

besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	119.7659

at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of august and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes	59.9556

but the lady asked porthos	110.3992
i should never have the courage to come down again ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this ones display of reason what is his folly he fancies he possesses an immense treasure	126.0933

dartagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	128.3237
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de châteaurenaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saintméran despised all who were not noble	149.1727

the jailer went away shaking his head	99.0580
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady	89.2625

wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here	170.4171
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of dartagnan	97.4127
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone	140.7426

he was a man of forty to fortyfive years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion	112.7356
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long squareheaded nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another	148.1575
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing i doubt it planchet replied dartagnan but what are you thinking of i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested always cautious planchet tis instinct your honor well what does your instinct tell you now sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came	140.1355
in ah ah said dartagnan planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	339.6160
dartagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue dassas is now situated breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night	82.3434
i tell you to hope	51.4581
he committed a crime it is true but he repented of it and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont	149.0507
i saw madame de saintméran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said châteaurenaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	163.9976
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor tell me who this man was cried the young officer	90.8984
yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you	36.1650
his friend do you hear that madame	71.0193
still he had not even uttered a sigh	75.2205
like women not like queens egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these and m	255.0343
this is not my weakness i tell you at once family joys have no charm for me	157.3522
on his side dartagnan became more cautious also	216.0365
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos	58.3054
some unknown enemyan invisible foehas done this the more must you fortify yourself albert	541.1198
perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something else oh no i have seen him eat of everything in italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows in a word said mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended and she left the room	114.9152
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted	45.4842
the next morning going on deck as he always did at an early hour the patron found dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks which the rising sun tinged with rosy light	180.0040
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was _non capisco_ m danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the postinghouse	107.8128
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence	56.0659
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death and ii swear to you before god madame said dartagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine	91.1497
excuse me excuse you for what	48.1150
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself	69.4231
this time it _was_ the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience	106.7200
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the diningroom your humble servant going first to show the way at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest	203.4195
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth	182.3337
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian i know it said châteaurenaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one	139.9124
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian	188.3842
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand	34.2752
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted	97.8140
do you hear ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows as you will valentine shall you be happy if i do what you wish oh yes valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening	143.2745
nothing	nan
dartagnan looked attentively at the building	99.5591
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds waterglass	103.4565
we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said	101.1471
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit	144.3886
the englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles	292.5775
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that dartagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois	120.6729
you sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants dartagnan smiled porthos wanted to lengthen out his names mousqueton to cut his short	240.9217
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets	106.9749
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	30.8560
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	70.0030
tell the viscount so and that tomorrow before ten oclock i shall see what color his is then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp	138.9212
what do you mean	11.7076
i expected this said felton	271.7036
_ma foi_ i havent consulted my daughter but if she has good taste oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fathers position is good hem said danglars	127.8323
thats a snare said athos dont go dartagnan and yet replied dartagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos	83.4778
you cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger	175.0735
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partners murmurs and lamentations	166.8271
i will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire likewise	146.9895
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	254.4469
i thank you for having recognized me sir debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor	92.5128
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles	138.5077
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of laiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles _roberges_ and feluccas	125.2588
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue	148.0398
they are the count of châteaurenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table m	145.7473
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at dartagnan hatefully	31.2958
oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man	116.7655
but the queen pressed the childs hand	85.2953
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future	142.2733
then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold	208.3367
this letter was in miladys handwriting only this time it was addressed to m	84.2359
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun	155.9832
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	53.3962
from m	255.8118
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question what is it sir you are fond of gardening passionately and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it you live badly on your thousand francs badly enough but yet i do live yes but you have a wretchedly small garden true the garden is not large and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat everything ah they are my scourges tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your righthand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him then what would happen i could not repeat	96.1487
the signals and then not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined how much a hundred francs the tenth of your incomethat would be fine work ah said the man	179.0794
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room	87.8799
very well sir said comminges you shall hear of this anon and you of me sir said louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest friquet and nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects	121.3405
each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth	200.6702
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons	264.3594
chapter	nan
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it	228.4159
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesemmanuel herbaut monte cristo smiled imperceptibly	262.9247
athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him	131.0379
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife	46.9692
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper tomorrow en teteatete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didnt see what that had to do with him	92.6998
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	142.0945
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	141.5666
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake but dartagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her	64.0250
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	230.2954
he could not help thinking of m	84.7208
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villeforts plot	159.5877
maximilian morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests	320.6305
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber the door had itself opened noiselessly	104.3028
the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array	187.9021
i dont comprehend you dont comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me which of my friends my lord your three friendsthe friends of former days of former days my lord in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones friend well sir returned mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too prudent my lord pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues but you have been silent for twenty years sir	145.6449
yes no doubt	109.7273
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right yes said caderousse	137.1976
deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing	91.3429
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss	276.3468
yes replied caderousse little albert but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself	139.4363
duty before everything	514.6786
covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help	189.6192
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	182.6496
going along dartagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not	125.4647
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies	143.4091
thanks dartagnan thanks cried aramis almost in a state of delirium	129.2511
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood	77.1963
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	78.1726
tis true he said but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask trousers said grimaud still squaring his accounts	137.9291
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	144.1911
you arrive in good time dear dartagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence	213.5191
thus dartagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means	179.1474
why ill wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too done said danglars ill take your bet but tomorrowtoday it is time to return	188.1790
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times and from that date up to the present day a hundred times perhaps so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreadshe who dreads nothing as it is said	114.0759
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather	229.0660
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain	175.6559
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinisma dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling	181.5692
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head	244.5965
here it would be dangerous the house may be watched	103.5782
m	nan
their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures	303.6679
one thing only puzzles me namely how franz dépinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife	221.0750
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty and she had signed it	118.8695
i told you so exclaimed madame de villefort	26.6917
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon ah my dear m	97.5316
yes i dare say verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de chevreuse	97.4072
was there nothing to fear	150.3271
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her	96.5995
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	86.5562
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess	134.9895
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty here it is replied aramis	147.0056
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked dartagnan	62.0074
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria	121.1524
forgive me cried edmond blushing deeply	168.1603
how did this happen said morrel	212.3896
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play	31.3716
i am going to prove to you that i have not good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning monsieur dartagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain yes my lord and your friend still longs to be made a baron at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already then said mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown dartagnan take this dispatch and carry it to england dartagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it	81.8406
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti	95.6179
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information to auteuil cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividi go to auteuil well what is there surprising in that	114.1413
de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twentyfour hours since m	190.9187
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground	108.4193
what is his name you know him indeed yes it is surely not one of my friends replied dartagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant	63.4563
m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested	103.8903
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m	64.3882
bonacieux i say that i have reflected i renew the affair i obtain the letter and i run directly to the cardinal well go quickly i will return soon to learn the result of your trip the stranger went out	92.5714
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m	49.6773
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau	121.2066
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	34.8488
we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars	188.5854
then he raised the flagstone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	53.6526
have you not perceived it it may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won oh difficulties do not affright me said dartagnan	100.6730
the deliberations had already begun	143.3230
danglars for heavens sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere	169.2297
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman but i am eager to see our young vicomte	82.9030
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you	77.5924
when the gentleman who came three months agothe agent of thomson frencharrives announce his arrival to me cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself	83.3410
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it	68.2109
let me kill him we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine ifaith i dont know	133.0946
i have heard monsieur dartagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him speak monsieur speak said dartagnan who instinctively scented something advantageous	152.0159
without doubt he recognized dartagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	135.4655
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken	115.6257
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone	78.2010
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	846.6104
peppino mounted the seat behind	141.5860
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	244.8033
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast	115.0838
dont make a bad use of it i entreat you	43.7694
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it	168.2292
on the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front	132.4662
m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantlepiece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a lookingglass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him	91.8729
to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation i knowthe famous hashish precisely	369.5712
it happened that on this particular night the ministers box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question	83.4881
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by dartagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to dartagnan that he should marry her	178.6434
i shall find him there without doubt you will monsieur he persists in remaining there	217.4902
morrel said châteaurenaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m	36.7199
they must be enemies he is right said porthos battle	148.8949
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same	66.7355
alas said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the kings face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth	198.7040
julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you	75.9217
de trévilles hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship havent i chapter vi	487.7750
thanks to the influence of m	23.3944
well then to my health although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his hands then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes	75.8263
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me	76.4678
dartagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying eh the king	584.5977
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow	177.5713
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	379.1752
m m	178.5286
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	73.0348
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree	144.5800
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me	50.0137
sir my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you i make a hasty resolution said morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey m maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed	80.5398
this is the order he said	33.1192
who art thou cried he clasping his hands	81.0101
where she was known as la belle provençale she was the widow of the marquis de castellane when she married de ganges and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothersinlaw was forced by them to take poison and they finished her off with pistol and daggered magistrate and orator of great eloquencechancellor of france under louis xv	157.4767
villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said châteaurenaud dr davrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it	155.5585
i am fond of grass and shade said monte cristo	72.0041
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost madwhat will not reality do but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you which asked the young man	121.0308
after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him	118.7244
the storm broke about ten oclock	349.8641
chapter lxii	216.6979
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès	187.8460
if he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with him what to do with him answered the prince	96.1516
_dentro la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing accent	73.8048
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity	134.0999
he no longer loved her he adored her	120.3660
let us see the dungeons let us first send for two soldiers said the governor	83.0565
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen the king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and i must give it for them	55.3373
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	160.3619
oh beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine	643.2324
brucea ferruginea	1900.7439
we will talk italian and spanish	401.7125
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentines mind	64.6547
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point	124.4206
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips	87.0830
de monte cristo arrived	55.0078
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush him	84.4475
dartagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet	35.4948
alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter mademoiselle danglars eugénie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count	79.1970
what are you doing you have wounded me to the heart never mind it for i see you once more said the old man and now its all overeverything is all right again m yes here i am said the young man with a promising future and a little money	86.1939
but dartagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped	119.9966
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of italy	159.7545
which asked he the viscount or the count the count oh exclaimed haydée is it not yet over i know not if it is finished my beloved child said monte cristo taking the young girls hands but i do know you have nothing more to fear but it is the wretched that man cannot injure me haydée said monte cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to fear and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord monte cristo smiled	65.5638
now this was a sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	63.0036
grimauds first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hours riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe	144.0124
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	93.6590
ah said he i hear a human voice edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron	167.0487
we hear from yanina chapter	696.9883
but wait a minute said m	153.1064
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	94.3515
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow	75.6397
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier	81.4818
morrel said dantès observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo m	283.1421
ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have it good god cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear dartagnan i think yes cried dartagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my friend ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires	127.5653
dartagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position	167.2124
divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets there were heavymaned lionskins from atlas striped tigerskins from bengal pantherskins from the cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to dante bearskins from siberia foxskins from norway and so on and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed	167.8838
mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion they said that he was sancho who after having lost one master had found two	199.3112
and what grimaud dictated	936.5806
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor	206.1352
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder	88.4113
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn	134.5768
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court	186.6493
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre	117.6115
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra	108.2211
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised	427.7306
m	nan
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned	119.2979
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it fifty thousand francs for being your father	85.4119
officer chapter lii	327.7281
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four	284.9035
oh yes but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover	104.0506
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no rue du helder st may halfpast ten in the morning now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself shall i see you again ere my departure asked albert	153.8325
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to dartagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel	121.0052
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me come now said athos you are joking in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his	87.7996
estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair perhaps you speak the truth aramis well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	99.8480
marie michon oh what do i not owe you aramis said dartagnan	69.3565
ah dear dartagnan see how regularly i live and how easy i am here	211.6249
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things	240.4886
de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison	410.1042
what the devil would you have me do with that said the englishman	62.1262
i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me	163.2029
danglars conceals at least half of his fortune and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said andrea with a look sparkling with joy	115.2018
i must find them within three days three days are a short time and france is large no matter you know the word must with that word great things are done and when do you set out i am now on my road good luck to you and to youa good journey perhaps we shall meet on our road that is not probable who knows	119.0001
morrel alludes continued châteaurenaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories	148.6095
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges	235.5621
now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable to no one by heaven i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place	155.3667
i have not tried to discover her other name kitty cried milady	89.7490
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across	67.3317
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	82.0227
what then have i to fear from him you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life	93.6353
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	132.0125
mine was carried away by a ball	84.1813
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you and you have me my lord	109.7814
let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds dartagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family	87.8658
he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there	227.0430
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at dartagnan who was counting on his fingers	167.2747
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them	75.2595
but the third time which is the present you may succumb	94.7349
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded pooh said caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said cavalcanti	195.9513
peppino placed himself beside ali and they set off at a rapid pace	103.6706
make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or illfated mother i have already told you my lord that i shall see no one it is possible haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris	99.4847
in this case replied caderousse lets have some more wine	151.5541
dartagnan returned	161.7696
the fourth as we have said was dead	140.0690
if i had any money said dartagnan to himself i would go away but i have none	40.3204
the three young people separatedthat is to say morrel went to the boulevards châteaurenaud to the pont de la révolution and debray to the quai	72.1539
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself	71.1752
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him	286.9204
from the comte de la fere said aramis	12.4924
albert de morcerf	52.2123
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	367.7022
here are the horses hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly	236.1898
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle	81.7657
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me possibly monsieur	52.6705
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune	84.5056
but to return to our millions certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world	44.9230
then your excellency is going to the hotel casa pastrini said the _cicerone_ to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on	55.8169
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest	113.1072
come come continued he patting edmonds shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain lecleres instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer	165.8723
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats all	50.9960
noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more	111.7138
had not government better profit by it	960.2949
de monte cristo yields his right of using his we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion	118.6838
what does it signify to you if i am murdered	49.0356
have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path never answered de guiche	201.7801
besides dartagnan passed the evening with me well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with a brow flushed with anger	114.1653
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti	101.0485
you were right sir said anne	50.3105
the marquis de saintméran i think the concierge said	93.8713
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day	35.9757
certainly	nan
you are the directors of all consciences	76.5853
he then asked with whom he played	151.9927
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter xix	78.1737
my horses said monte cristo	25.0076
adieu adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate	128.9427
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only servingman whom he had left	69.6994
you have decidedly some genius at your control _ma foi_ spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvetlined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf	78.1015
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey	92.7058
coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk	122.2849
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy	34.3313
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation	193.1429
maximilian morrel do you not grandpapa asked valentine	131.6074
the president again arose and having imposed silence saidsir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedif you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the generals anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude saidi will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly	122.8483
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously	68.3300
dartagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle	117.0935
yes said grimaud	48.2461
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood	69.6355
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him	126.6474
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary	64.0453
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	90.7726
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said beauchamp in a calm tone	44.7804
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saintméran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two	120.6083
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore	72.1854
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman	94.4045
mordaunt ah thought dartagnan the man i am warned against by athos ah thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition	174.9797
what monsieur i have a miraculous balsam for woundsa balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself well well i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you and at the end of three days when you would be curedwell sir it would still do me a great honor to be your man dartagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage	98.5420
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there ah truly	121.0342
cavalcanti	nan
but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened	110.2906
they proceeded thus to peronne	387.0278
the guards under the command of m	92.7388
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another	116.5214
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith theres enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris	141.8889
the spade perhaps an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the gravedigger had found the object of his search	112.3579
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb	134.8480
chapter	nan
m	nan
trust me said aramis do not expect to find anything in abbeville	51.1062
good heavens we are on the very eve of it	50.0118
morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what the money well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest thanks my friends thanks cried morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman	130.8260
it was a pledge a remembrance	117.3015
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visitingroom	54.0145
let us put down added albert smiling	173.8750
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning	86.3301
how should he have been otherwise	80.2069
friend porthos said dartagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy	60.1505
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought	49.1045
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day	92.8366
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall find i have found already what i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself pooh women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself thats what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever	165.9048
ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho	195.3538
absolution father absolution tell me her name and i will give it her name wasmy god have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die	110.2277
follow the culprits steps he first kills m	554.5869
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air	70.6395
can i have lost it	32.4450
a year after madame well i wanted to see the good curé again	190.9849
as to m	45.2702
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon and dartagnan dressed himself in an instant	109.7892
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year of the hegira	107.2103
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no in the avenue des champsélysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps	70.6267
when he had finished with the orangetree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orangetree pricked him dreadfully	141.5374
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over	133.9399
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath	107.5219
yes count returned julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels the counts cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth	138.4039
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for fiveandtwenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid	110.1891
it is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged him	50.1671
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	122.1184
where asked dartagnan	42.6545
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m	107.0025
de villeforts antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name	116.6957
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary siron the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which	127.2953
occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled	124.2968
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight	40.5770
but you come from england	100.9487
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee the sergeant began to laugh	94.0528
we have something very important to say to him i understand said athos but why not porthos	66.9943
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship	87.7025
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	242.2990
who is there answered the voice of her he sought	80.6642
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance	91.0896
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so	141.6745
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes	120.1001
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative	206.2715
pray try and obtain a small government pension for her every revolution has its catastrophes returned m	538.0990
why do we hate	164.0790
well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham you shall not do that dartagnan said athos coolly	46.3411
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house	233.0072
i too sir was almost dead when you arrived wait wait young man do not fatigue yourself with speaking	512.0618
the deputy procureur du roi chapter	189.6188
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear	74.7688
here i am wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us why all these precautions you shall know milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	113.1311
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army	82.4918
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them	70.5439
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is halfpast eleven oclock haydée will soon be here	140.1120
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	150.6494
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetitegriefand as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatand love	74.6924
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	352.7491
now then cried carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me no returned the chief she is thine carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight	94.2599

dartagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him	45.7958

de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead	82.7031
porthos was the first to speak	33.1854
athos went down to pay the reckoning while dartagnan and planchet stood at the street door	88.7242

he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	116.4316
now if you have them andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his pocket	170.3643
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand	201.2289
at length they arrived at the cemetery	36.2154

m oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat	667.5545
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy	45.5396
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself	454.2716
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	191.6178
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyespetticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation	150.1331
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily	73.5277
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us	147.1728
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack	150.6350
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not i know nothing said m	33.9863

noirtier and the elder dépinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife	270.8121
dartagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him	68.8821
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	142.9760
goodevening m	138.9012
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach	99.6776
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	73.7465
by force	7908.9780
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers	90.8672
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease	47.7108
have you not heard that some one is coming here yes well that some one will open the doors but my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you dont propose i imagine that i shall kill that man of the church	95.9826
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts	378.3559
it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended	194.1270
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark	121.4670
fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercédès	183.1775
indeed said dartagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy	156.7582
this reassured her	1090.4645
besides my friend dartagnan has something to say to me privately have you not dartagnan dartagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine	92.2040
besides this time my visit has a motive milady trembled she thought felton had told all	186.6896
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman	131.5896
he rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack	159.1190
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity	371.3582
towards the evening of the third day	27.4190
poor cardinal seven men in two days and those of his very best but thats quite enough gentlemen please to understand thats enough	308.1702
it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme	82.6134
dartagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	256.5759
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur dartagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment	98.4880
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much _finesse_ and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted	113.9046
but by degrees watchchains necklaces particolored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded	230.1860
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel	69.2389
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang	148.7003
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villeforts we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts	106.0021
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of belshazzar	146.3271
dont you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage	107.1570
onward cried porthos	57.7548
what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt	1255.8282
i beg you to do so replied albert	31.2292
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen the only chance for alberts safety then will arise from your emotion i suffer from emotion said monte cristo	90.1795
m	nan
some voices even added long live the marshal but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet	205.7772
whom does this belong to he inquired	515.2510
de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect	106.3933
dartagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen	41.0276
there is myself replied milady	87.2109
la houdiniere _captain of the guards_ the devil said athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the other i will go to the second after attending the first said dartagnan	82.9746
and they separated with courteous gestures	723.2925
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure	93.0932
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	284.4115
morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the _pharaon_ of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor	65.6029
look fernand your eyes are better than mine	332.5077
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	126.1144
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness	145.5767
wait what are you going to do asked aramis	22.4608
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land nothing at all smugglers are not thieves but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril	142.8540
albert attributed to franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask	191.9719
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds i have nonenor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts what has happened said the count simulating total ignorance	150.3728
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year and related to the true cardinal	53.8815
dartagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket	105.7942
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request	49.8560
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty	46.9956
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m	38.4259
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sundial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sundial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longerbytheby sir do you think dormice eat them indeed i should think not replied monte cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did what	134.3576
go monsieur duke and return often	1003.3536
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safeconduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feareddartagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreusehe may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby	95.7339
not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away the devil whats to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you cannot take me with you no the order is	91.1490
imperative	nan
lord de winter was not at home and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening	45.2145
de villefort was not at table	42.1094
humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a no on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge	217.1382
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	175.3480
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you and on what will you sleep said dartagnan	95.2897
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to dartagnan who pressed it respectfully	44.9331
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live said aramis	174.5157
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder	83.2309
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted and is that allis that all replied buckingham impatiently	139.7937
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	159.0133
arrived at ryston dartagnan assembled his friends	271.8164
yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows	111.8868
bonacieux	nan
do you wish for any further details	64.6205
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge then you disapprove of duelling	119.8976
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign	112.0582
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands	75.6530
i will not sleep where i must scorn	155.9986
to the sword sir the sword and he jumped off his horse	151.8303
i dont say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming true how so why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny	163.5200
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish imagination	160.5593
dartagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance	63.9626
to the smaller i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen well what has happened to them they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and dartagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the kings service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell	121.0041
me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken swordblade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis	165.4986
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo	172.5350
the pretty mme	4014.1187

he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	86.0368
i ask pardon of your eminence said dartagnan but i was so fatigued dont ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service dartagnan admired mazarins gracious manner	156.5126
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in peace i doubt that replied dartagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	94.4128
i thought i saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream	108.9090
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles	93.6031
bonacieux was at his door	35.3066
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning	88.7183
must i take anything with me money if you have any yes fortunately they have left me all i had so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel here said milady placing a bag full of louis in feltons hands	88.8714
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles	142.8854
i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur dartagnan is confinedthat is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery mazarin thought for an instant	88.4463
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count	58.6829
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune	148.8806
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom	157.9659
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the united states	56.1188
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemys movements	92.8198
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	156.6293
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step	68.8160
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them i have not done so	87.6844
goodmorning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m	209.9340
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father it is well returned the voice tomorrow these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall	99.9457
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest hush said milady let us not even here speak thus of him	131.3735
what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m	115.0479
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saintmartin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren	177.8747
he will see us if we go out then you must come up into my room ah said mme	64.0722
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	113.8260
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	62.0283
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept patrick brought the object desired which laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen	191.4810
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of _la jeune amélie_	88.4658
a groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles	252.9159
this time dartagnan was not hasty	76.1693
i could not ride behind	318.9390
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores	160.4809
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of today and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church the mendicant shook his head	101.7701
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	32.3998
he then endeavored to reenter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman	156.6674
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier dherblay two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword	103.2430
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it	253.0475
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dogs trick or other and that immediately said tréville	146.8583

but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory	95.1528
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme	87.8242

no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii and i will adhere to it these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness	75.8979
at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor	87.7473

at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes this was delirium	882.6628

well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord as we have before said the postchaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration	186.7053
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him	118.4411
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide no no continued dartagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman	206.1133
you have been here a very long time john said he	83.4401
stop said he i have an idea well thats something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly but as to dartagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to _ours_ has driven him out of his senses	77.3885

crown pieces onlysilver pieces i suspected it	739.9600

bonacieux to the chamber of examination	165.4843

bonacieux had not been abed	44.6376
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him francs for a mouthful of bread	152.6651
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice	344.1292

athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder	120.1349

richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money	111.6124
i do sometimes soldier though i am monte cristo advanced into the room maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him	110.4485
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain _or_ on a sea _azure_ with a cross _gules_ in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lords passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personages past life	193.4708
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france	101.0553

look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	89.5381
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to be	55.1310
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble	256.0517

during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape	48.3285
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service the young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated monsieur dartagnan that is it my son the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed it	64.1371
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	46.3147

at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto	445.4882
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad	108.9814
the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge	91.4730

mme	nan
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself	116.4716
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the kings musketeers in these quarrels	184.7744
at the same time the door was opened	8.3744
one was the notarys the other that of franz and his friends	64.8199

to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when dartagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered herthese were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure	134.6750
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	225.1298
and the drawers yes those at the side no the middle one yes valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	206.5438

was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	102.7736
the prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant	161.0267
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled	98.6498
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part	74.8194
i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave	37.8118
bertuccio left	297.7922

at this last thought mercédès burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to us the old man died as i have told you had he lived mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity	122.4304

he looked around him and saw mme	50.7980
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his eminence aramis then joined athos and dartagnan who were consulting together	102.3955
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	145.2820

ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind dartagnan in generosity i would give as much as a hundred pistoles the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates	151.5890
aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that dartagnan and porthos might enter	96.7645
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage	98.2071

during this time nothing new occurred in the camp at la rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st louis at st germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers	158.0051
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the goldembroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable	161.8795

at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door	48.1576
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior	85.8929

the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune	179.0150
very well cried dartagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said dartagnan	173.3963

before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in	74.7795
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission	68.6721
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling	291.5929
he was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late	144.8815
i believe i see double	200.2784
well i was not hotheaded then well but what else could you play for	110.1551
valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted	117.3805
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champsélysées	150.7559
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion	184.1610
come laporte said the queen	33.7376
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	181.8750
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscounti saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything	103.2027
the fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch to which it had retired to die of old age	79.7864

everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room	35.2556
de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again de wardes one of the cardinals men a cousin of rochefort stop my friend i have an idea speak monsieur in your place i would do one thing what while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions	107.1265
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m	114.5262
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	71.3911
now gascons are always poor are they not sire i can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your father which is to say that the gascons made a king of me myself seeing that i am my fathers son is it not tréville	152.4532
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son	90.0040
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slepta vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell but for dartagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were diaphanous	366.9937
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception	158.1610
i suppose that is not all to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we cannot wake up mazarin a little a bad plan youll be shut up again in the bastile oh as to that i shall take care i assure you	93.8235
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here so much the better	304.9139

you have read the letter yes you know how imperfectly the women of the _mezzo cito_ are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class yes well read the letter again	87.5333
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her motherinlaw as you please sir said franz	122.2223
the man was caderoussehe was pale and his shirt was all bloody	120.9794
once for all tréville had placed his stable at dartagnans service	282.2256
the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy besides the name of the comtesse de winter which she had heard the abbess pronounce was wholly unknown to her and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life	88.7788
i understand you fernand you would be revenged on him because i do not love you you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk	105.4237
what do you want sir asked the driver	40.9996
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great however my mother had still some hope	229.3833
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth	91.8356
adieu my charmer i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor at these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared	102.5707
among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance	63.4172
the sport was bad franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper	253.3576
have you traded it for your diamond no it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather frenchwomanfor i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned her that ring comes from milady cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion	85.4954
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me	213.2213
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m	41.3980
take care i repeat to you take care	80.3727
it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand trévillean edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel	132.9896
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet dartagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant	105.5855
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	251.2828
by no means	163.0207
your majesty wishes then you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply	92.5624
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	103.3954
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death suddenly about nine oclock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying	92.3420
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	143.3648
mordaunt remained standing near the door	34.8944
what can i do for the son	46.9332
a king said dartagnan its a good omen master groslowlook out for the king and in spite of his extraordinary selfcontrol there was a strange vibration in the gascons voice which made his partner start	120.6775
then turning to aramis aramis he said break your sword aramis hesitated	262.3359
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the momenta conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation	91.6017
tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man	108.7514
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister that is a strange question said aramis	60.7091
i will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale	193.3836
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said	98.4430

de tréville had the right of entry at all times	51.7946
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven	71.9038
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps	131.3149
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	108.9167
is he alive and at liberty	321.6530
dartagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber	88.9933
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard	113.6387
but ibut i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross leap coward cried raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir said he courage we are coming to your aid olivain advanced retired then made his horse rearturned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as raoul had done only repeating i am a dead man we are lost in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	206.3207
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris	143.5838
neither had any	200.5446
dartagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of mme	51.0949
i respect old age but i dont much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt	167.2069
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	87.5862
de morcerf will kill me morrel looked at him in utter amazement	65.8130
thats well madame and there is an old proverb that says traveling trains youth my faith you are not wrong after all and life is sweet	218.4295
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	94.3803
it was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour	76.0015
unfortunately said monte cristo ones title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts indeed said danglars becoming pale	202.3367
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff	142.5651
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peters franz silently assented and the following afternoon at halfpast five oclock the young men parted	177.8597
they are beating the general alarm the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	101.5886
now i recollect what to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphiles the evening before the day fixed for my wedding	185.9331
heres to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther and as dartagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself	139.7723
dartagnan looked with surprise at his friend	58.6735
meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased	434.5213

i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would	58.1172
m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life	217.4159
is he much changed he has become an abbé that is all you alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable soldier could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the pont du louvre oh oh exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which i hope you will take your part where are we to go my lord to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her this is an enigma	89.2492
said athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it i ask no further	72.3758
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de saintméran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand	109.4638
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	56.1744
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband	149.2333
oh the devil thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours oh lord no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as i cannot possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud which i have not yet had time to remove the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions dartagnan had conceived	128.7496
mon dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog does he hate his majesty as much as he does us pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property true said aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him	130.0504
athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy me	396.3546
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really	105.3196
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes	28.7755
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horsemen	125.7637
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell said mazarin	200.1673

in a dungeon which good lord in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror	182.0273
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands	70.9700
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here an enemy cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin	81.6435
he lighted it and retired	160.4043
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place	322.0953
no cried dartagnan no steel	454.0570

noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m	155.6429
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall	169.6180
luigi vampas bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars	587.7694
you are going already he said	81.6820
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking	58.0907
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst	283.3747
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you	43.7445

your highness willingly answered the duke give me the pie i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste	67.7928
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience	141.7040

it was that of la carconte	92.5867
yes my lord answered the man	24.5088
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand still if people will shut themselves up said albert and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen i am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house yesterday i was at your house sir said the young man because then i knew not who you were in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby	101.4023

well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth	130.8980
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol	99.6747

as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign	65.4919
or a tiger ali bowed his head in token of assent	125.2913
it does not concern me you are right and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of mercédès the catalane ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commitfor i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude but exclaimed monte cristo why was i absent	94.0542
edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale	159.0791
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as muchbut it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits	154.1528
he therefore informed m	411.4514

dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	130.4887
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m	106.5638
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle	97.6616
it consisted as we have said of a small dressingroom opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone	134.5701
she evidently interrogated him by her look	207.4669
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt	163.6896
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros_	72.0305
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from	69.4697
if he comes out we shall catch him	85.1300
as dartagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m	199.0952
at eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that dartagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow	89.6858
at the corner of the street they met the counts steward who was awaiting his master	31.1745
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever	152.2188
madame danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth	54.8167
dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire	119.4152
i only ate some fruit	1364.1755
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero	263.9829
two methods of selfdestruction were at his disposal	74.3666
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say	128.7306
well asked madame danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood	100.1415
the guide held the door open	153.2620
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	41.6406
my letter of recommendation cried dartagnan my letter of recommendation or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten	117.4759
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for dartagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors	156.1383
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter	259.2517
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock	205.6488
be assured you will not find her majesty ungrateful oh i am already grandly recompensed cried dartagnan	152.8961

i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough	71.8344
my dear dartagnan said aramis dont be too angry with me i beg	35.6587
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events	185.8975
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure	212.3770
as to porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair	223.3521
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction	102.5361
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others	137.6052

my god my god said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer give me then strength to suffer the door opened gently the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance god of goodness wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished then only she pretended to hear the sound of feltons steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees	168.3426
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majestys well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	91.6143
maximilian chapter	236.0399
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least what is that did you observe dartagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton no but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles forget them for a time we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground do you think that likely no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it you reconcile me dartagnan well then assume a cheerful manner as i do we must joke	126.7942
with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we cant corrupt them	121.8893
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos	50.9526
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	106.0409
she believed the order ready for execution	240.1816
two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five	203.8609
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the king	118.5743
the duke walked so fast that dartagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him	138.5142
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person	156.6445
all is well we may sleep tranquilly on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and dartagnan who was very weary bade goodnight to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him	102.7520
well he said to the lieutenant	27.4522
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person it is my lord i have not named her interrupted the young man warmly	60.8383
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that _ventrebleu_ cried dartagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one	124.1069
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances	287.0592
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter	113.2867
cocles went first and the stranger followed him	85.1556
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtiers expression than by valentines indisposition	389.8391
a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage held a gourd full of rum to his mouth while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow	189.6984
you have understood me then dear monsieur dartagnan said milady	68.5165
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands	92.0650
nearly ten minutes passed i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart	73.4384
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh	111.2848
all four came up together	777.3995
near the louvre the four friends met with m	51.4187
the day was employed in preparations for the execution	69.0275
athos started	322.8711
franz dépinay yes franz astonished advanced a step	555.3699
what have you done with her then if you have her no longer they have abducted her monsieur they have abducted her	131.7667
athos aramis and dartagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender	208.3310
however i will not go back on my word and i will give at least replace the diamond in the ring said la carconte sharply	67.5513
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity	235.8024
no more than a drop of water in the ocean remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the abbé	169.7420
do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse	82.3017
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed	63.9025
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	95.8231
no we have had great annoyances there	247.9000
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la ferei can see nothing remarkable about it my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens	100.1597
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber	214.3158
well i went to a horse dealers where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah	117.6490
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him	259.9511
it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death	91.2975

at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions	72.6993
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care	46.2957
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met de rochefort	46.3022
oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars	432.0734
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered	200.0316
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness	47.9565
oh the scotch he exclaimed the scotch i called my faithful to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford the scotch my brothers but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated todaythis morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose to do what	157.5384
fernand dashed his on the ground	144.6461
a man can easily be put out of the way there then it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the _thousand and one nights_	63.5240
besides we are in a situation to overlook ceremony come then let us go to your friends house	92.6348
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldnt serve mazarin	358.6182
i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations	137.4623
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husbands father yes madame m	93.8644
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve	78.0953
policar morrel who served under the _other_ government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon	144.5768
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the _moccoletti_ were extinguished as if by enchantment	62.6958
did you not yet know me	32.4359
this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now representedbroken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughtsbut such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes	155.9898
to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle	78.9163
as you please he said death is always deaththat is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him	176.8950
he arrived valentine was expecting him	208.1684
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	241.3275
very well indeed sir replied comminges at first like you he seemed distressed but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening ah cried dartagnan the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere yes and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself ah our dear count said dartagnan	50.0762
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars _née_ hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	186.1129
i have just made m	58.1642
the escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to wait	87.3433
he had passed and repassed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there	127.7524
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i dont know my way	80.7949
at last his patience was exhausted	206.8384
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored oneblood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess	178.3670
fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs at ten oclock then if you please i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow very well at ten oclock you are still at the hôtel des princes yes the following morning with the bankers usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young mans hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse	70.6041
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long	95.8411
honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation and the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh	129.1428
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries	183.3170
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother inlaw he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them	89.8633
dartagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient	123.8960
oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein	73.3485
then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your heart	47.2375
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god	134.8733
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rentas i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux replied dartagnan trust me i am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct and if as i told you i can be of any service to you i believe you monsieur i believe you and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you finish then what you were about to say the citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to dartagnan	61.3168
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second	99.2722
dartagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	206.1749
you know or you dont know that that is what we ask of you oh yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises charles had heard and understood it all	145.9433
i have an idea which i will explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation	150.1312
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you	144.4531
there is no doubt of that	18.5442
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the day	71.4166
what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness	77.1785
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m	74.9321
this is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall wellmade	205.9671
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation	69.3967
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	125.5625
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever	247.7019
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared	136.7144
de salvieux	228.6326
de saintmérans oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte dartois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence yes they were talking about it when we left paris said m	157.2976
he weighed the two angers in his brainthat of the cardinal and that of the queen that of the cardinal predominated enormously	58.5606
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queens carriage	30.3145
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke	115.4652
have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state that may be my lord but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i cannot accept your offer this then is what you call devotion i congratulate you	81.7039
thats a daring rascal whispered the count	227.9120
oh tis heretis heretis overmy sight is gonemy senses fail your hand dantès adieu adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he saidmonte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed	195.8482
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his selfabasement	96.1769
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward dartagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which dartagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that dartagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight	113.9965
i swear to you you shall receive the consolation that you ask	60.0825
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted	142.1413
thanks replied the jeweller	65.4661
disguised it was very boldly written if disguised stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation	144.3084
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me	129.6592
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws	101.4509
they found him up less pale than when dartagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons	106.3388
the lights again this time i too saw them said porthos	288.5790
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer	167.3250
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeeda very probable thing by the byin gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper pack	158.8027
avenged yourself said the baron	35.1257
de saintméran villeforts fatherinlaw	497.4965
it was now cromwells turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable	183.5159
violence he said to himself would spoil all dartagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt	131.6647
are you going pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire and what message shall i convey to the baroness that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening the third act had begun and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars	92.9331
noirtier yes well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w	76.9647
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage	76.1442
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	108.7766
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance	196.4530
stop stop cried dartagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men	451.0951
everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey	166.0687
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m	140.0388
why it is as good as a century at what hour does the examination take place at two oclock send at twelve said danglars smiling	157.8855
ridicule sirwhy you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it sire sire murmured the minister for pitys approach m	125.3053
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud grimaud replied athos	104.2866
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for	122.0980
a summer ball chapter	357.8547
can i be of any use to you chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	80.0960
i will be an abbé if it suits me	90.4515
this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already pluckedtwelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen	479.9937
besides there was no tranquillity in paris itself	197.8872
at last they reached the tennis court	103.4134
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him	157.6961
do you know monsieur de tréville their captain oh yes him i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i cannot reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan with chagrin	90.5375
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare	69.7255
oh it is impossibleutterly impossible what i have said i have said answered caderousse	71.0162
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness	103.5169
he is black and cannot speak returned monte cristo	144.1109
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen private interests are as nothing before the interests of all	131.2370
but dont sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep	262.0260
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away who told you that my dear asked milady	87.2771
you want valentine do you not	54.4682
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean dartagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	113.8869
the messenger was unmoved	219.7979
the cemetery of pèrelachaise m	86.2518
have you a carriage no that is of no consequence i always have one ready day and night always ready yes	237.7090
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse	349.9831
before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movementnot a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him	110.4145
bonacieux having left his house at seven oclock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence	68.6207
aramis blushed	961.3657
i have my plan	84.5346
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling	45.8951
as i expected my officer was there	183.8207
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said dartagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier dherblay who wishesas you may have heardto offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis	102.3620
rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people	112.4866
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an underlook at the count the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity	162.1059
the prince was said to be in person at bethune	118.9051
but to you at least m	65.1964
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crownswhich however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his	98.0749
_protégé_ monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville	44.2138
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant what mousqueton is here then oh yes monsieur	187.8052
danglars and you caderousse and fernand said caderousse with a chuckle fernand too is invited my wifes brother is my brother said edmond and we mercédès and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word	93.4266
he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slavea dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment	149.0640
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawingroom now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea	149.1002
but to grieve my fatherto disturb my grandmothers last momentsnever you are right said morrel calmly	139.9852
your blessing your holiness before you go i beseech you he cried	120.7445
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation	68.7149
dartagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions	165.8564
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm	124.8242
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his fathers dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who was	77.3915
that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count	101.0493
de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m	171.2457
albert rose to return to his place	39.6128
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	254.8147
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	96.2186
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountaintheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m	149.2767
de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him	58.5265
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most wellmeaning	89.0103
no and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over youhe should have occupied my placehe should have emptied that glasshe should have risen against the assassin	122.8033

he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him	89.6554
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres	84.2198

no one could be seen or heard	94.7713
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence	181.3903
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss but yet detail them to me why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one	256.6702
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	119.4980
this tranquillity proved one thingthat dartagnan did not yet know milady	246.2978
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy	252.9008

this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his fathers residence or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ the abbé shrugged his shoulders	120.1112
come in my host now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself	199.8233
adieu madame in saying these words dartagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved	129.7874

oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver of whom of myself cried morcerf _parbleu_ do you think i cannot be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads	142.1377

there were no questions	159.6793
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right _animadvertuntur in desertis_ a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap	101.4267

because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation another method of assassination said the general shrugging his shoulders	126.7701
noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to	118.7317

dartagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him	100.4301
dartagnan here himself but thats impossible he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal	65.6133

haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel	86.6952
when i like caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	133.6339
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe	70.4828
ha ha ye romans you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city	277.6311

morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet	143.1846

now as a quarterpast one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes mercédès will have become madame dantès m fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company	85.5189
oh my god who could have said so the evening before	83.4052
it was necessary that dartagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber	96.2064
de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past	68.4987

he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow	62.3847
the old mans interrogative eye said which i will go continued maximilian i will seek m	130.7719

this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows	360.6949
and will you not torment me any more never caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change	115.7069

leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment do you know the mediterranean i have sailed over it since my childhood you know the best harbors there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage to dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us if he says true said the captain doubtingly	124.5546
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you	28.7229
well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the house and this elixir where is it	70.1550
dartagnan took possession of his command	95.2091

i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea but it is very hard for me my poor caderousseyou take advantage bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores one would have said andrea anticipated his companions words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment	112.1245
and dartagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected	372.8224
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	217.4067
winter give the necessary orders winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet	221.1795
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides	62.6309
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe	78.6469
keep near me said the latter	39.5622
danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry	136.8665

albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive themit is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert	191.5553
andrea said the latter with his halfjesting tone how do you do charmingly as you see	39.3945
he ran towards her	72.3751
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar	113.7813
we shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventuresreturn in short to our former life these last words fell on mousqueton like a thunderbolt	182.1492

louis xiii like every weak mind was wanting in generosity	309.7166
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done	85.5776
the lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twentyfour hours the bite was mortal	175.0479
it appears the conquerors had something else to do well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man porthos nodded in sign of agreement	159.2284
have they spared me	163.1894
on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully	152.6935
wholly yours aramis dartagnan tried to recall his remembrances	317.2107
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related	103.1522
hey friend cried the duke	57.0123
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	317.5085
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved	131.4998
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles	147.1286

yes sir replied the englishman	26.9612
it is well said monte cristo	12.8144
she therefore contented herself with saying that m	123.1581
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression	137.7185
i confess myself conquered	1313.4867
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was	80.6292
at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them	84.1242
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards	37.3814
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	437.6446
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie precisely said the cardinal	85.8915
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	118.6401
on the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères	44.1958
lord how i have eaten m	182.1478
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	204.7854
i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees	192.1523
yes sir he said in a softened tone	41.3176
one has never the last word with such a man	95.2734
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franzs imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina	147.6785
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m	102.5915
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not	254.9039
and if i do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of selfpreservation	108.2555
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord dartagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminences order and that i shall await him at the stables the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter	92.5605
bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabriai have sailed two months in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered thats all yes and your conversation is most interesting and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for monte cristo the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage	103.8841
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the counts safety became now quite a secondary matter	131.3018
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	96.0499
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me	113.1504

the lackeys followed armed to the teeth	288.4662
signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said dépinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signaturessince you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfactiontell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door valentine who understood sooner than	191.4464

he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair _incognita_ belonged to the aristocracy	159.3492
danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions	169.9152

spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate _à latere_ who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him spada set out about two oclock to san pierdarena	178.9315

de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid	57.7500

well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now i did you have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the other it was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune	93.7273
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her	87.9606
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	77.9240
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony you are in a hurry captain danglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercédès said just now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the _pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in less than three months we are always in a hurry to be happy m	108.9545
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed give that to milady	130.6501
upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the travellers face	127.0508
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	86.9839
he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her orders	46.1932
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	127.2119
then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if i am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for i have no future to look forward to	136.1915
i would lay a wager he has stolen it do you think so answered dartagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity	193.6457
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy	95.9218
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning	62.9572
what is that said he whence comes that cry from the wounded mans room replied the host	107.4936
accused said the president your name and surname andrea arose	153.8307
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	56.1903
i love that humiliation i who am master of the universe as was augustus but where are you really going to sea viscount you know i am a sailor	138.4126
villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his brow	45.9949
oh no said kitty it is not me you love it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the _soubrette_	115.7387
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus	80.1683
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m	90.8026
you alarm me	244.7783
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so i alone am to blame for the indiscretion	56.4878
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account	89.9390
you see your friends are wakeful	173.2060
de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the _entrée_ by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber	68.0672
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought	113.1550
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy	91.0198
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said dartagnan	186.9077
tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it	92.9721
de villefort	3.9719
and yet that villain benedetto will escape no one i tell you will escape benedetto will be punished then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priestyou should have prevented benedetto from killing me i said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you but i found you proud and bloodthirsty and i left you in the hands of god i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse you do not believe it you lieyou lie silence said the abbé you will	98.0275
force the last drop of blood from your veins	97.3867
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglarsso be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that	140.2596
period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned	130.9083
faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman	111.7152

stop said he i will go with you excuse me sir said franz since m	42.9162
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated	42.5384
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth here i await thee there was profound silence	115.0062
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers thats true said dantès but the corridor you speak of only bounds _one_ side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	193.9081
he is reduced almost to the last extremitynay he is almost at the point of dishonor how yes continued caderousse so it is after fiveandtwenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m	115.0129
monsieur she said ii do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions	93.5835
de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv	189.6947
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were	82.4317

chapter xxxiii	53.0803
dépinay that is right said the old man	18.2873
gentlemen said dartagnan you shall have your turn	29.3736
and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any other place than the barrier saintjacques the galleys or solitary confinement	170.7279
they have been speaking of my marriagehave they not yes replied the angry look	161.8563
the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when dartagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good	78.9172
she was a charming woman of twentyfive or twentysix years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal	110.6446
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended	94.7520
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	221.0866
now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart the count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than mercédès	76.3568
my lord has forgotten the supper no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present go on then have it your own way come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	96.4814
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance	118.1299
the coadjutor alone obtained nothing	584.4116
i know who it is then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord impudent fellow cried dartagnan you will get me turned off the gate groaned on its hinges and dartagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal	134.0762
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès she pressed her sons hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her	171.5732
dartagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour	148.5458
dartagnan then looked around attentively	145.8118
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted	51.6340
to cours la reine cried dartagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance	98.8892
the demon had known how to wound him	823.9548
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then the devil said porthos what can we say to mazarin leave that to mei have my plan	85.3853
let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes but the queen is sacred and if anyone speaks of her let it be respectfully porthos you are as vain as narcissus i plainly tell you so replied aramis	151.3362
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him	97.6313
well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt what love asked the young girl	47.6409
surely answered danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys head meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form	290.6695
grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes	49.9982
valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking	113.4747
bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis	110.7054
they can move their arms they can and that is much	276.2751
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten him	107.5244
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron	48.5233
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week	384.0170
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	68.6217
from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them	34.4819
no one can say that m	78.5262
franz dépinay	326.9741
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire	181.1515
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	207.7298
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	77.3894
ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so with m	110.0618

the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf	54.2690
m evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck	164.9310
dartagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing	58.8984
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to younot mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the playfellow of our king louis xiii whom god preserve sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger	134.7051
my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness go up said the host she is still in her chamber athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat	114.4133
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del montecattini here is the priests certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment	169.1494
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring	91.7569
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing what are you saying asked the queen	139.1770
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass what	81.7648
everything was in readiness	45.7842

conclusion epilogue authors preface in which it is proved that notwithstanding their names ending in _os_ and _is_ the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them	105.3186

mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and dartagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	221.2377
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair m who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young mans ears	106.3688
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him	184.2112
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said beauchamp let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our childrens children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to youfor had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself orno my poor mother i could not have killed her by the same blowi should have fled from my country dear albert said beauchamp	125.7995

yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me but if the _pharaon_ should be lost and this last resource be gone the poor mans eyes filled with tears	112.7421

a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lackeys porthoss plan appears to me to be impracticable said dartagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you	146.5508
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies	188.3039
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid	76.2826
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the wellbred from the vulgar man	166.5935
come with me then	49.7707
what is it grimaud	54.1718
they want food already	6359.8135
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs	11.1698
well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany he is rich then i believe so but that ought to be visible that is what deceives you debray i do not understand you have you read the _arabian nights_ what a question well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds	114.5576
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	52.8221
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine noirtier nodded his head	260.3518
what the devil there must be plenty left replied dartagnan	142.2077
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began	82.5608
and whose horses are these cried dartagnan	282.2324
take a cigar really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rosecolored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standhow happy you are to have nothing to do	125.8024
that is my failinga capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good drinker athos spoke this in so natural a manner that dartagnan was shaken in his conviction	148.5470
come come continued the count i see you are still the samean assassin reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not iit was la carconte that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there no reverend sir i have been liberated by someone that someone has done society a great kindness ah said caderousse i had promised and you are breaking your promise interrupted monte cristo	107.3459
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman ah old woman screamed nanette	850.3941
well then you must be registered as charlotte backson milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror	195.2435
how grateful will m	2487.4375
let me see it said milady	18.2916
morrel we shall see	168.8571
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists if he persists said the cardinal	71.8239
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the selfsatisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond	99.9991
what next de wardes cannot boast of anything how is that	311.7685
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fanshaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the subtropical sun	152.5550
dépinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort	51.1906
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man	70.1538
then when they had disappeared he said with a smiletis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a waterfowl ere it takes to the wing set sail	132.2879
chapter	nan
dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	98.2519
bonacieux saw that he hesitated	82.9773
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo	112.3994
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed	129.5363
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majestys health	151.7075
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos	173.1480
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame and by whom	60.1948
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said dartagnan	96.5982
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison	138.6773
châteaurenaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_ joined him beauchamp did the same	145.7572
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder	202.7515
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	133.1457
what granted mescarcely more	3806.3711
the poor devil would eat nothing from fear it is incredible no my dear fellow it is not at all incredible	104.9539
come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly theres nothing i wish more replied mazarin	210.9548
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come i have been advised of it but the three millions the three millions are probably on the road then i shall really have them oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment	77.0876
do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of _robert le diable_ and when the fourth begins takes his departure chapter	137.8989
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure	63.5420
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune	311.2079
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him	115.0607
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	103.1637
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile	169.4537
have i not been there once yes but at that period we were not at war	97.2259
your fortune exceeds francs does it not asked he	171.0517
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity	80.7364
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in	43.5770
they are two hotheadsthe one a gascon the other from picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately	376.9131
de villefort	3.9719
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon	140.5269
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her	189.1863
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head	151.1664
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queens disposal	64.2654
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely alberts mask fell off	197.6130
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please it was three oclock in the afternoon	54.4513
whitehall	nan
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	105.7242
groslow	nan
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his review	77.0381
silence he said or you are lost	58.7020
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tonguetied	384.8904
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent	126.9504
now one evening when dartagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	112.1775
but this unexpected unhopedfor unheardof fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and howby a murder you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to justice it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse it was la carconte yes said monte cristo and godi cannot say in justice for his justice would have slain youbut god in his mercy spared your life _pardieu_ to transport me for life how merciful you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galleyslaves you said i may escape from prison i cannot from the grave and you said truly the way was opened	194.4632
for you unexpectedly	600.7719
oh is it you dear friends	161.2750
dartagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself	70.3016
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged	70.9187
dartagnans ball took off his enemys hat	190.9283
besides we must try our own arms bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless manner	126.7035
do you know him	12.2920
on perceiving mazarin he bowed	166.8183
mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred	111.7359
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly	103.0043
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream	241.7231
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host	105.0112
_le blanc_ was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiègne and four oclock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop	141.8157
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but wewe shall remain i have a presentiment that we shall yes replied dartagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battlestandard that famous napkin of the bastion st gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleursdelis embroidered be it so cried aramis	270.9330
dartagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance	99.9496
i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies very well replied m	135.1876
i am free then sir cried dantès joyfully	126.1706
dartagnan does not tell you raoul said athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his timea knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire thats what his adversary met with	95.1667
neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more	130.1884
morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès from m	96.5747
de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten	71.7799
he was called count he was said to possess livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme	147.2346
dartagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out	70.5814
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarins niece	231.4385
it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young	107.4231
it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	112.7331
but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me	164.7228
do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open particularly in the night	101.0175
then dartagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting	111.0083
with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so la ramee laughed	219.8424
m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old mans limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open	158.8314
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age	113.7831
guilbert de pixérécourt french dramatist	447.6235
bonacieux recovered her senses	302.0545
dartagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	176.7000
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was	64.0074
and what has happened to you my dear porthos continued dartagnan	18.5460
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings service dartagnan colored	182.8663
what could put such an idea into your head yourself ahwhat next most assuredly i should like to know upon what occasion oh _mon dieu_ that is very easily done	239.6310
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts content	202.7565
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m	68.1984
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way	36.9264
come four	2769.5056
a few hundred yards beyond the town dartagnan drew rein	151.3366
are people to be run against without warning	628.8558
let us do justice to dartagnan	51.0954
its my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not	115.6917
dartagnan to wait i shall have further need of him these words gave great joy to dartagnan	123.8178
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his fathers neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrels breast	91.8890
he would no longer be alone	47.4885
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself then replied dartagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fairhaired head by me and though hes but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes	120.7785
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes	52.8010
i cannot calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me	89.4934
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me	95.1336
can you not tell me his name at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs	40.4914
i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather	35.1248
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst dartagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity	243.6463
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain	94.0510
i was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just now and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	111.4441
are you ambitious	59.9051
i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saintméran has fallen a victim i did	110.2930

as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor pastrini the proprietor of the hôtel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them	101.4704
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table	108.1318
i think him capable of everything well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us yes and for a most curious one go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it i was at rome during the last carnival we know that said beauchamp	107.2549
albert could not understand the bankers look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectlydid you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can i tell you because i imagine you have correspondents in that country monte cristo smiled significantly	84.0008

teresa said luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts daughter yes replied teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish and i replied very well you shall have it yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please me i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly	116.4952
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu then they gained the private staircase and dartagnan was ushered into the oratory	86.2932
near the barrels stood selim my fathers favorite whom i mentioned to you just now	264.2964
noirtier had once made a will against youagainst your familyin favor of the poor in fact m	277.5140
cavalcanti will bring without touching the money	292.2044
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saintjacques no yes i am vicepresident father your coolness makes me shudder why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a haycart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierres bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things	132.4840
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud	54.3934
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat behind	177.9710
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo	46.2024

thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and dartagnan a captain	89.2795
dartagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool	149.0320

at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only threequarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavernkeeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace	89.1666
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the _mandaïa_	88.4011
they were his friends and not mine	138.8029
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	99.6101
planchet go and find aramis	264.1306
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now no father stammered villefort at least i hope not and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care oh rely on me said villefort	120.2490
there is a carriage coming said châteaurenaud	114.8513

though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king	170.2050
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known	125.8379
do you think it will be long before he comes in no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock well i will go and take a turn in the champsélysées and at ten oclock i will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin	70.1567
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine	138.4637

haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water	158.8345

as to dartagnan he did not budge from his apartment	34.4759

suspicion instantly seized me	283.3975

almost immediately bazin came downstairs	653.5201
this woman passed for his sister	74.8374

an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury	189.8183

the young man remained immovable	37.0318
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free	123.6077
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others	152.3904
now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here i am ready it is important that none of your crew should see me i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself	72.8896
bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband	57.6362
all at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone	146.8215
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach	222.4173

they were only fit for a young man i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and i do not think they were dear	84.6717
whilst dartagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris	54.9895
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	91.5655
has he not already forgotten she ever existed	215.9641
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris eugénie covered her face with her hands	90.3539
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such coldblooded policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on alberts side	98.6197
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat	103.0978
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows	121.8741
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded	256.5531
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike	121.2295
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive	138.7556
stay said dartagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw dartagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms	86.3897
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted	70.3804
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	102.4359
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration	95.1277
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role	144.4613
has he a lady with him jesus what do you mean by that	92.3202
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your boarders said milady oh my god poor woman i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	96.5224
afterward mme	1285.1385
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon perhaps returned the count smiling	97.8472
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked gondy	39.1189
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me but does he not approach the walls while playing your eminence doesnt know those walls they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable	184.8929
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead	56.4227
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the partition	159.6909
you know how little i require said the old man	43.8509
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the icecold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought	134.6383
the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hidingplace the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside	133.5405
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out he did get out nevertheless do you think of escaping in the same way i am a prisoner then parbleu said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted	87.3473
i will take charge of the inside one	126.0805
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving dartagnans composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you cannot pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the	87.3230
musketeer with admiration	679.8674
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches	82.7784
bonacieux the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of dartagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that mme	114.0303
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it	57.4456
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied dartagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host	117.2457
in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open	93.1274
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo	106.1766
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence my chaise broke down coming into lilliers capital what _capital_ yes i want your chaise and how shall i travel then on horseback you talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues whats that one can do it afterward afterward	210.9717
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you my love for you	64.3821
in five minutes they gained the land	89.7872
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	243.3806
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use	64.9183
saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude	66.1640
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all	25.1108
he was struck by a sudden idea	87.5914
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary dartagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach	137.4146
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	177.2652
the porter was not yet gone to bed	56.3464
one might believe the queen was about to speak	47.9808
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven	75.9108
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind felton has not told him said milady to herself	153.4066
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the mainsail five minutes after it was down and we sailed under mizzentopsails and topgallant sails	182.3403
nevertheless to dartagnans great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely	517.5015
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies	117.5949
i thought i had quite said groslow	129.1903
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawingroom with her little edward	57.2643
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the ministers cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his	86.6792
thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the antechamber	85.8474
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved	211.3295
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	200.7254
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground	243.5228
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	46.4716
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived	172.8235
the counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man	88.1153
i wish to tell him to make my child happy i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey mein fact i will know himi will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty madame said villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness	93.6327
valentine with her womans instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	103.1814
dartagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume	52.0232
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all	79.9804
listen said the young man to the sentinel	20.1953
nonsense said dartagnan you would do as much mr humanity in a battle	146.0701
i am anxious to see that young man nearer and wherefore aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that i am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man in beauty or on the contrary asked aramis laughing	76.0359
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost	49.2977
well that has happened friend porthos	247.0942
noirtier asks for a notary i suppose he really wishes for a notary therefore i shall go at once and fetch one barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted	184.8462
was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria	354.3099
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	90.8169
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potionbegin with paradise and end withhell	114.2978
shall we go forward	104.9055
halloo la ramee some one la ramee ran in haste to obey the call	288.1250
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto	36.1681
i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone	100.6755
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conqueror	143.3827
i follow you though i am not hungry come if one cant always eat one can always drinka maxim of poor athos the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely dartagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athoss maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host	136.7142
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself ah ah said porthos that is what you meant to say yes dear monsieur porthos	114.8740
the baron has just related a frightful story to me milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	131.6487
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart adieu count said the abbé dherblay i return to my convent adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach tomorrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening adieu gentlemen said the count i am going to sleep twentyfour hours i am just falling down with fatigue the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look	119.7432
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result	140.7086
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of m	62.3434
nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice i think it is better not to make them then said raoul this monsieur scarron is a poet yes you are warned vicomte	92.8479
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here	58.8465
i also have made my preparations this morning oh heavens yes said aramis	127.0304
dividing the proceeds chapter	55.6266

they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free	121.7293
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack	105.2847
it was six oclock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp	61.3622
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point	94.6549
all right said caderousse	145.3975
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred ah _ma foi_ who is to know perhaps it is some political difference my father and the baron dépinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort	92.9701
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her	60.6848
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m	214.7238
no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence renée uttered a smothered exclamation	198.0231
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir	85.6102
nothing is lost then and now madame till i see you again tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out	79.1752
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the wall	113.5675
do what i tell you and immortality awaits you villefort fell on his knees	92.6819
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine ladys couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification	113.3145
it is no nonsense it is quite true	61.0599
dartagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m	242.5289
he is to bring us five fresh horsesone for his eminence four for us	159.7909
yes replied the stranger	33.7576
bonacieux prophesied	10539.6680
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands	120.6660
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps	216.0344
next morning dartagnan was the first to rise	60.2505
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	109.7400
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon perfected	524.6599
i am a great captainthat i am but i make war in my own way the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley	74.6227
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise you more intrigues nothing but intrigues thank you madame i am aware of them now monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that head the cardinal cried mme	179.7208
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken and what bastion is it asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be cooked	119.6836

you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felons life might live as other men	167.1019
poor dear monsieur dartagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans hand	52.9625
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horses head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest	208.8129
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister	104.3692
at eleven oclock kitty came to him	61.7740
noirtiers room	162.1675
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	79.9946
what he asked athos	132.1577
this was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and porthos	81.9711
on the evening of the th of september m	16.7747
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him	119.6987
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old mans happiness was centred in his granddaughter	141.1872
stay look at m	254.1060
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes	77.5027
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion	72.8320

bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village	438.9033
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him bear with him whispered aramis it is doubtless some spy after my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man i shall hear you with pleasure sir the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king	121.4842
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	32.6272
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia	284.0235
goodbyei must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again	113.8651
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom	128.4670
speak command i will obey morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening	154.9759

i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm but what then they who love believe easily in love	279.0947
you cannot for a moment imagine dartagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted dartagnan	179.7471
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps	85.0552
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the _thousand and one nights_ and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto	53.1617

davrigny i should kill myself well said the doctor after a moments silence i will wait villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words	55.4717
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleonwell can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellowcreatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey	136.5371
the executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm	30.9208

beauchamp replied florentin	1555.7378

one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	148.3980

but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	128.5667
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a newborn puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton	96.7554

come reflect and decide your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied dartagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely dartagnan paused	160.6105
she was still exceedingly handsome	106.9208

under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action	276.8528
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill	156.3482
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking	49.9881
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish half past seven had sounded	197.3932
de wardes must take his departure still in obscurity	328.6770
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn	74.6592

mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinals cap then he added so my friend its your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape thats my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it	78.2376

his hands of which he took little care were the despair of aramis who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil	174.5918
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars	56.8488

what hatred she distills motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme	217.7080

oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twentyfive thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild fiveandtwenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilians heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	107.1657

albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up	79.6157
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	143.2278

franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	97.9348

however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	203.2495
davrigny accosted the priest	327.5039

the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets	85.3138
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash	69.1583
ah it is certainly you he cried	73.4380
what a disgrace to us oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too an excuse for us to meet dartagnan with a false excuse to have to make a false excuse to porthos oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	157.8936
he fixed his eyes upon dartagnan even more earnestly than before	111.9482

porthos told him of it in his calm manner	57.7653
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	40.3580

chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	35.3441
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood	110.2575

but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired	197.1369
valentine rose to fetch the dictionary	87.8872

i live retired in the house of my noble protector but i do it from choice	129.9766
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	218.3846
dartagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion	117.5300
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs	447.1512
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers alas this desperate resistance could not last long	267.8894
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud	126.0598

the four friends followed ten paces behind him	52.0798
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	115.5999
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	55.8339
how many men think you you could collect together tonight two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by tomorrow we shall have quite a powerful army	269.1469
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority yet jacopo reached him first	266.9360
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	63.0495
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper silence exclaimed dantès	143.7623
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through arras	212.7309
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him	118.6376
as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed infamous task impious task cried milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge	127.3598
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound	152.2369
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means	184.6998
but dartagnan had now slipped through the window	83.3718
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre	150.2452
i shall hide myself in your cabin	157.8473
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat	179.9393
the nails too were turning blue	5000.8135
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is	234.7165
as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him	78.8872
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels	218.9193
dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	164.4792
a week passed by	138.5346
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles	197.1882
the count received him with his habitual smile	49.3912
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set	125.2117
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened	242.6455
the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii	181.0168
he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased	441.5440
yes madame said the young man	8.2997
should you like to be rich and your own master _parbleu_ said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question take the postchaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pontdebeauvoisin	127.8065
it is past noon said she and today is saturday i dare say it is the doctor grandpapa noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition	169.8536
she undertook his seduction and succeeded she would have seduced a saint	339.8757
not at all my young man	112.6526
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity	94.6193
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador	116.3062
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos	101.9402
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	22.0768
at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome	133.6183
because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance dantès smiled	99.1058
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m	212.6316
that is whether you really love me i have given you proof of that it seems to me and i am yours body and soul thanks my brave lover but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of yours	76.6343
be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen herself what do you say sire	124.6312
the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world	116.1916
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes	243.1317
it would be exceedingly droll the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	108.3714
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	117.9755
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti	77.6961
hark i dont think he put the faucet in again	68.2108
m general dépinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	104.1648
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglarsa small octagonalshaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin	120.7859
de villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following him	131.2362
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you	67.5858
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him	144.5368
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking hush said la ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts	140.3175
and with whom with whom can it be if not the duke of the duke of yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice	136.7060
bravo youve killed him i think no wounded his horse only what would you have my dear fellow	166.3157
well monsieur he is still here ah _pardieu_ my dear dame said dartagnan springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life where is this dear aramis	77.5909
dust i am and to dust i return	211.0526
noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	133.1387
ah hes gone to blois the poor boy wherefore ah to inquire after the little la valliere she has sprained her foot you know you think he has i am sure of it said athos dont you see that raoul is in love indeed with whomwith a child seven years old dear friend at raouls age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real	183.7005
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur dherblay entirely as to the last point though i agree with him on the first	111.3720

noirtier	nan
there are in this bag three hundred pistoles	112.9753
dartagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands he paused	81.6407
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another	113.7873
section	nan
after dinner the play monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests	217.5905

villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head	79.0956
oh yes that is well and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket	90.7848
porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities	165.0295
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared	323.0370
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eightyfive departmentsi say eightyfive because i do not include corsicayou will not find then in these eightyfive departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp	98.2092
my lord said dartagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere willingly said the cardinal i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos	64.5956
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily i am not the queen	71.0890
is this young man an assassin by professiona murderer in cold blood	278.9218
i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you tréville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failedhe who knows how bitterly i execrate himto tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him	100.9349
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france	126.1556
then dartagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly	109.2663
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze	99.3285
and you want my blessing he said	60.1118
you will appear at this ball yes with those studs yes the queens paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character	141.3489

i promised you a letter for the director of the academy	41.7020
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes who then urged you to write	123.1076
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening	135.5626
edmond found some solace in these ideas	249.4007
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon	141.1883
and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo	14.0834
very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me	150.7354
de morcerfs	531.3653
clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen	219.9717
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine	190.1986
the count soon heard andreas voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano	369.6247

he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbés cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue	133.8971
i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed said cromwell staring very fixedly at mordaunt	319.9128

he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle	71.0978
go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the gardenhedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence	140.5054
sire replied tréville without lowering his voice in the least either order my musketeer to be restored to me or let him be tried he shall be tried said the cardinal	107.8033
as they stopped at the door of the cardinals study dartagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder	51.5082
several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto	320.9909
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps	92.2994
no my faith said dartagnan	30.9181
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers	134.5923
from the queen replied the servant	70.4601
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to methe beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus	269.4074
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolenceswhich even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastropheswere seen to be utterly futile	142.1403
danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear	287.8715
oh what is the matter cried dantès	22.5485
i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis	87.0620

the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband we are very happy monsieur replied julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves the counts features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity	158.3490
the hostess as she entered saw dartagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon dartagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly	131.9205
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england	112.1772
dartagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen	146.6960
do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer	99.7247

and she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window help help for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people help comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder fire assassins master broussel is being killed master broussel is being strangled it was friquets voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	294.0096
the religion i serve the god i adore were blasphemed because i called upon that religion and that god but still i resisted	411.1114
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	102.0707
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue	79.3190
i accept it interposed dartagnan proudly	378.9568
de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm	129.7224
yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucienand considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures	78.2617
cannot monsieur cromwell wait a little yes but i said mordaunt	272.4090
for his fathers death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès	98.8190
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of dartagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last monsieur dartagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone monsieur dartagnan shall die indeed is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo	102.7365
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit	98.8259
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details	106.9631
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the _ennui_ he may experience	88.7259
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way	236.6585
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted	122.1386

drink a glass of port said aramis it will refresh you yes let us drink said athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with dartagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country	101.6771

again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve	132.1556
i was promised he should die with me	121.3796
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	242.5318

i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our musicpaper	723.6923
i know it and now the ranks began to open	72.2548
dartagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other	96.2087
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed	248.3811

he told me to watch you and why so	90.9387
do you permit me to return yes tomorrow the cardinal took the queens hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips	42.8325
dartagnan cast an inquiring glance at milady	134.2431
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room	52.5217

ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it	72.2540
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound has he been wounded then oh good lord what have i said you said that porthos had received a sword cut yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so and why so zounds monsieur because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on	117.7890

well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château dif for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged	155.2201

he was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them	117.6973

god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause	201.7070

in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again	392.2063

the moment is at hand he said	142.9252
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the waxlight always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment	198.6576
dantès your health fernand rose impatiently	2232.6226
_ma foi_ there is no hurry	52.8430
upon gaining this advantage dartagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman dartagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features	111.0344
delaunay in which he offers to purchase the goodwill of the house to unite with his own for francs	63.4589
once more replied the major	79.7289
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions	109.0539
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparationsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	68.4581
they knew the counts energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself	136.1167
in the first place light me a torch ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment	115.5164

come sir wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other key go and fetch it i will leave you the torch sir no take it away i can see in the dark why you are like no	88.4239
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé	153.0244
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed at what	116.5708
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from granite then he added aloud but you have relations left you i have one remaining	239.6319
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly	104.1637
bonacieux	nan
their masters are dead i thought they might be useful so i took them meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols	165.6522
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable	61.0556
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse	242.6415
franz dépinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy	207.2343
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	567.6211
dépinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off	140.8216

there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be usefulthat of the king exactly answered the musketeer	95.3210
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment	94.9780
my dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word i will blow out your brains but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon so much the better they must be good animals then sir i shall call my people and i mine ive ten guards behind me dont you hear them gallop	82.7358
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed	119.8785
you are ambitiousit is natural you are a man of genius and you know your worth	70.6284
three compartments divided the coffer	365.5087
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars	185.1757
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor that is my opinion said aramis	61.7039
my idea said dartagnan	43.0425
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressinggown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears	88.6108
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared	147.8261
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed air	80.3589
de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin	148.9675
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder	57.1858
he started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her	210.6004
return as soon as you can florentin	142.1724
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressingroom	91.3684
a worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a position	101.5127
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a doorkeeper	81.1750
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth	471.3862
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet dartagnan	76.0277
you have deceived me said the cardinal sternly	41.3264
franz to do with it	92.3645
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so porthos looked at dartagnan with an expression of profound admiration	46.1333
dartagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not come	74.4699
morrel good worthy man said caderousse	237.7997
yes but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony yes you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son noirtier made no answer	71.8574
i pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me	238.5171
_ma foi_ said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m	45.2049
charge cried porthos	47.7243
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	69.9198
what an injustice my dear invalid i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say	108.7749
my friend said aramis if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you ah said dartagnan is that the way you return to your apartment after nine at night pardieu said aramis the rule of the convent is very severe pardon me my dear friend said dartagnan i think you said pardieu do you think so said aramis smiling it is possible	65.0110
noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	93.3577
begone and may god guide you amen cried the young man and set off at full gallop	102.1374
never mind	1160.3384
ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband guilty though he were	122.8126
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth	146.3644
oh the devil take this gout athos and aramis took their leave but even in the antechamber they could still hear the dukes cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	125.6342
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she	67.0264
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary	171.1806
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	150.1792
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved	72.0159
revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed	123.7710
so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m	95.4244
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes	227.8495
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling yes	155.4378
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow	76.5216
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not unskilled in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission	115.2132
let us come to some conclusion	42.0681
i mean the russian prince who you said had livres and we only found you must have searched badly luigi vampa himself searched in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that or spent the money possibly after all certainly	364.1089
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you dartagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in miladys soul whose depths were dark and unknown	116.8804
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed they have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal eagerly	113.6607
in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his ordinaries had been to henry iii and his scotch guard to louis xi	302.9858
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates	290.4821
she was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her mistress	100.5494
if the serpent be dead why not its brood	616.7338
speak out are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror asked another	306.2407
yes you said you had an idea said athos	49.6306
at the sight of the little letter the heart of dartagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	52.3345
chapter viii	87.1937
de tréville i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself	114.9889
shall i help you madame asked athos	54.5563
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself exactly therefore i think of sending him away from here you will be wise to do so no doubt of it but it will break his heart	108.1998
they drew near to the sloop	117.8376
i threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that i mightnt break my promise and strangle grimaud i doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness pardieu you are righta mute from the east i swear it was time for you to come back la ramee and i was eager to see you again monseigneur is too good said la ramee flattered by the compliment	111.4022
then sitting down by the fire my supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite well done carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while diavolaccio disappeared	192.5209
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room	30.8981
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	123.7053
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the armchair prepared for the royal prisoner	144.9703
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	259.6084
no certainly not and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him	113.8431
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see what asked athos	106.0181

i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly _london sir if you please and my master lord dartagnan_	150.1941
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter	39.8384
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	87.0330
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger	141.8950
come barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade i see you are coveting a good draught of it the fact is mademoiselle said barrois i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i cannot say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it take some then and come back immediately barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which valentine had filled	104.6003
m a girl of six or seventhat is a little younger than vampatended sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa	197.8174
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly	48.2063
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur darminges and beat a retreat	130.5416
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour	118.0926
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england	54.7632
for two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense but once free and placed in communication with laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days earlier	231.3834
this cannot be the establishment of athos	83.5260
ah you remain in london said porthos	65.4785
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the halfclosed teeth the white lips no longer quiveredthe eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax	144.8515
three of the four horses had already arrived	47.1859
i am m	142.7024

there was to be sure father joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence as the cardinals familiar was called	152.7441

in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play	421.5698
la chesnaye louis xiiis confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call	225.6107
mazarin now understood that cromwells envoy desired to retain his incognito	368.9645

information about the mission of project gutenberg project gutenberg is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middleaged and new computers	24.0523
what the devil paris is not paved with cambric monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said dartagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions	181.4146
leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have reentered their cell	123.9403
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid	316.4968
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn yes monseigneur	61.0330

it bears his signature as you see which is allsufficient bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket	122.6671
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it	160.5641
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his mother	118.9054
it was saddled and bridled	233.1803
there was but one tavern the post	229.2749
i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived	36.0163

except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europethe english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	153.7670

he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside	114.4411
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees	144.1977
beware monsieur there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter	132.9779
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	81.7092
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me	126.3277
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter	50.7005
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two doublebarrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly	129.1212
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard	159.4900
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then sight returned and with it feeling and grief	129.4740
this was simply because he lived in the hôtel	94.4626
the result was that to prevent mm	168.5829
dartagnan signed to them to draw near	134.3307
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated	252.2492

oh where will be the end villefort rushed into the room	131.1294

but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women	102.7227
danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide	114.9490
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting	166.2889
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and sensations	315.1293

the next day was spent as usual	95.2287
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	515.5189
perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them	147.4767
what vessel is that asked milady	168.0408
why in the first place i gave you fifty you think so _pardieu_ ah that is true	81.0100

i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart	113.2432
haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawingroom	60.4471
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transactioni come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtiers eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so	77.1004
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near	68.8612
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents	88.5991
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused	37.9691
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert	75.4263

fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune	187.4375
theres luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced touch it not grimaud he cried grimaud what art thou about	165.6371
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime	181.7711
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	150.3920
but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now merciful heavens besides mother why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed	113.6443

ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our revenge	85.6054
my own service said dartagnan	35.1311
yes monseigneur replied the officer	52.2282
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom	91.7514

they would have found they have not found but they are on the track yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it	103.7347
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you but you guess it now do you notor rather you remember it	104.0497

edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and cannot now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating	141.4920
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught	144.9199
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview	239.0357
te deum for the victory of lens	78.8687
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths	150.7520
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics	101.0351
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	141.6701
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish	53.7218
i am like nero_cupitor impossibilium_ and that is what is amusing you at this moment	61.0918
de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this _give us_ sounded revolutionary in the deputys ears	182.8161

de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment	136.1369
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	159.2175
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench he cried	119.3922
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters	132.6981

the three presents of dartagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april the market town of meung in which the author of _romance of the rose_ was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it	67.2648

a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	233.9855
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind	84.9469
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here	169.0958
de morcerf the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality	148.1219

as monte cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and sparta why demand permission ere you enter	143.7661
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him	61.2019

tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken	120.6165
besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so thanks monsieur said monte cristo i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but i cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared what cried morcerf you are then going to a hotelthat will be very dull for you was i so badly lodged at rome said monte cristo smiling	70.5163

besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing	216.6652
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart	132.4036
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose	137.5499

but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactorthen count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols	129.1160

there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithfulall of course on the part of the hostess	172.1609
onward cried dartagnan in a loud voice	20.8702
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a markthe trunk of some old and mossgrown olivetree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand	185.6139
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church	47.4612
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the hôtel and went to his apartment	97.9609
but the glasscutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies	66.4645

i detest him an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income thats true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune dartagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses	112.5163
alas you have purchased it dearly enough dartagnan left athoss chamber and went to that of porthos	212.0481
will you eat any of these beans cousin porthos said mme	276.3750
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table	108.6212

ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside	124.2235
oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance	138.3732
eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage	39.7166
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction	98.4852
what is it i hear a horse it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us no said dartagnan it is in advance that is another thing said porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by dartagnan	64.6395
theyre after me was andreas first thought	419.4355
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was a beam	262.0782
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand then did you see him edmond who the marshal yes morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him you saw the emperor then he entered the marshals apartment while i was there and you spoke to him why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile	76.9750
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal	34.6246
we have said that at halfpast twelve oclock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage	61.7547

the counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	253.6082

felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying voice	110.7438
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him	71.7227
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince	59.5415
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	59.7853
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries	158.4381
coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her	225.6896

when they entered dartagnans chamber it was empty the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp	107.0626
than the son of peter mazarin	179.2236
i leave you therefore as i took yourich but little respected	219.6509
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me	93.9552
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve oh oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me dartagnan bah perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos	91.7587
the tree was easy to climb	122.1405
nevertheless he pressed dartagnans hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered	66.5288
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to herbe assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide	129.8932
but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence	122.3754
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation	132.6800
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still yes we	495.7158
repeat your fathers name said the president	34.0072
dartagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the kings quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	100.3539
and athosi dont see athos	239.3250
the procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse	131.1777
in fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	163.0117
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune	226.4438
i only ask you a simple question answer itthat is all i require i love a young girl count do you love her much more than my life another hope defeated said the count	128.9049
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better this exclamation which corresponded to the counts own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder	150.2598
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window	51.0995
stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms	82.7814
there and elsewhere the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	108.9045
three replied aramis smiling	209.9828
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands	79.9921
oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant i shall be dressed athos then called olivain	155.7424
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off	206.9244
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him	121.1931
this letter was from my brother	74.7361
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris pshaw pshaw i cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it	92.2750
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres that is admirable said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other	158.3828
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	62.1984
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès	95.7454
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty	351.8302
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	145.7610
there what do you think now of the affair	80.9419
what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	197.7544
the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him	96.0637
he again struck it and with greater force	252.0360
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friends entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to ritas father at frosinone	128.5981
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination	295.9420
de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor	114.7522
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door dartagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive	79.4382
i have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of dartagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	202.2183
chapter	nan
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the lawthese advocates to promote your majestys welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	93.9149
nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows everything in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife perhaps he may but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wifes relations with madame de chevreuse but monseigneur i know nothing about them i have never seen her when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her and how many were there of these linen drapers two monseigneur and where did they live one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de	110.2259
la harpe did you go into these houses with her never monseigneur i waited at the door and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone she gave me none she told me to wait and i waited you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal	105.1415
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous limetrees	110.2740
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions	237.5693
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment	85.5946
where are we going inquired aramis are we going to fight perchance	182.0450
juxon was waiting for him impatiently	63.5492
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears	95.1179
who occupies number the little fellow who arrived last night in a postchaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish	233.4779
at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay this yacht had been built by order of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fastsailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs	98.6901
another might threaten to seek m	277.8099
on guard but said he whom dartagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the préauxclercs what you say is full of sense replied dartagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely	136.9913
very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	130.7967
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal	157.4080
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer	343.0638
on his part the king returned to his apartment	33.5718
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	302.3057
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	127.0724
the one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch	207.1065
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	37.0208
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii	90.3813

he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	64.2970
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary	111.6523
after finishing that calculation i had a minutes hope	424.2383
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room	188.1519
it would be very kind of you no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be are we alone yes replied the count going to the door and returning	51.9502
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger	54.2827
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be what do you think aramis why they are our men you are not mistaken i recognize monsieur de flamarens and i monsieur de chatillon as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal in person how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon athos smiled but did not reply	85.1291
now he said to teresa are you ready to share my fortune whatever it may be oh yes exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically	85.3375
until then you will not see me	22.9835
what impossible	34674.2148
ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep	114.2220
from the count said bertuccio	104.6254
of danglars yes to be sure must i say baron danglars	208.9075
what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel	158.7073
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent	119.8418
exactly and you have that letter of the cardinal said dartagnan	40.9068
yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said morcerf	32.6496
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day	53.8467
that is not all sir continued mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from mr cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can i do for you mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this moment mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make	105.1720
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads albert had often heardnot from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersthe description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him	120.0406
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	151.6422
then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him	94.2790
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean	136.5867
cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry he shall receive them on returning from the mayors very well what next	157.9264
wretch returned the old man what hast thou done and he gazed with terror on rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom	128.0289
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate	102.1504
he saw a corpse at his feet	53.2528
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flowergarden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him	98.3227
all hands to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in	136.0012
nono i lent you money and you returned it thats like good neighbors and we are quits we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude whats the use of mentioning that	215.6976
dartagnan thought it was proper to follow this example	82.0064
flee alone flee alone and leave you here	202.4129
so much the better are we then to go to war by my troth yes against whom are you a politician friend not in the least are you for mazarin or for the princes i am for no one that is to say you are for us	71.9917
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended	162.9669
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in	59.5812
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain	389.1177
m mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast	222.5833
dartagnan lost no time in useless compliments	408.3636
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	96.8366
you only know that this money exists	150.3524
he repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be announced	112.2223
however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor most willingly duke under your auspices i will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding	110.1480
ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him	103.9676
i am all attention said the abbé	47.5354

these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his pocket	111.0610
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oclock	80.2359
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	174.5763
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly	114.9696
what man is that	59.5504
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	111.5447

grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred livres	221.9404
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it	88.6800

anne of austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her	122.3687
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried dartagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to reenter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which dartagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse	114.6042
in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i doublelocked carrying off the key ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution and was the sum a large one it was not money ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box	107.0917

he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind adreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure	160.8972
as to the key it had disappeared	47.6660
yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i cannot answer as to what i may do myself be prudent in any event said the countess	96.4180

and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	120.8772

athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddlebags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes	94.7373
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one	108.9258

his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityin fact the application of the axiom _pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you_ an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of _knowing others_	169.1171
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin	140.8717
eleven oclock had struck	97.5409

he held a vial of salts in his hand	36.9982
without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it	65.2735

once upon a time well go on signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them	106.1851
a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way	65.5832

a rapid change took place in the young mans feelings	189.7799
whether noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him	77.2248
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfathers meaning at all times that is quite true said barrois and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentinepermit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility	163.9606
châteaurenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	112.1024
athos killed his adversary first	457.4260
i always knew you were a good son and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence dantès smiled	82.2669
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself	289.3989
oh yes was the ready answer	290.6135
the palais de justice communicated with the prisona sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clocktower of the accoules	213.3799
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah mon dieu my dear monsieur de rochefort do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety	79.1337
i have augmented our fortune and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned itwithout any fault of mine i can honestly declare	250.0175
while dartagnan was examining mme	181.6934
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart	136.7908
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily	173.0440
oho whats that the lightning answered the captain our felucca so far so good laughed athos	317.5974
at this time athos came up to dartagnan	33.6526
jesus seigneur	1692.5950
did you really think me capable of that at least said the abbé i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been	107.0952
kill a woman	79.9172
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it	61.6094
the glasscutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him	193.9658
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him	88.9682
speak my child speak said dartagnan i listen here	87.5878
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them	114.1782
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner probably not well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet	103.8990
lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars	124.2955
how do you feel this morning he inquired	77.7747
order of the king i tell you	23.5756
the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had witnessed	45.6869
i know he cannot save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence against whom against my murderer did you recognize him yes it was benedetto the young corsican himself your comrade yes	158.6660
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely	220.3438
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii	475.7617
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them	85.4995
most of my readers are aware that the second act of _parisina_ opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo	120.8250
there said dartagnan this is capital now let me try on the dress of yonder chap	100.0313
and has this man displayed a friendship for you albert she asked with a nervous shudder	252.1322
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis do he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door	107.8650
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france ah that is different the house you purchase is at auteuil at these words bertuccio turned pale	120.5780
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans	67.5227
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows	120.5861
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saintjacques the affair in the rue saintjacques exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation	116.4970
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips	234.4097
on the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond studs	235.2754
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly	254.9633
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at stay said debray i recognize this hobbema ah indeed yes it was proposed for the museum which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo	161.7327
obey said noirtiers intelligent eye	725.8191
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost	277.9640
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its transparency	153.0020
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m	687.4355
cavalcantis father will be gone but the son will be here will you invite young m	113.7445
preceded by ali who carried a rosecolored flambeau in his hand the young lady who was no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristos companion in italy was conducted to her apartments while the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself	79.2846
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted	204.3566
then you will start after the queen no said mazarin again	106.8891
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	59.5133
where were we i recollect you were saying said dartagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france	95.5741
are you superhuman	407.5771
they threatened me with torture	399.7771
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	214.9244
dépinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract then you have my promise maximilian instead of signing i will go to you and we will fly but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other	84.9830
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali	41.8950
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance	73.2497
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard	101.7261
dartagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him	188.2052
it was necessary to separate	32.9526
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach	139.5451
what would you have said the musketeer	28.9053
why do you like that best because then i have no responsibility	65.9977
is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short	116.9342
in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as davrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villeforts room	131.0199
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me	71.4314
the house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea	129.9703
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present	266.0612
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m	191.0435
come i beseech you lend me twenty francs so that i may buy a dressinggown it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same thingsindeed he heard nothing else	106.1770
i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressingroom	68.8295
theres nothing to do in paris now theres no fronde	164.8518
dartagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers	132.8632
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor m i did and you followed the business of a tailor true i was a tailor till the trade fell off	163.2036
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarins mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned dartagnan	160.7579
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of chapter xxxv	138.8447
i tell you that you were wrong the voice of the king was tremulous with anger	44.2529
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it	132.0762
but will you not go up pass on before me i beg of you as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant	111.8770
it neither increased nor decreased my income albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject	212.5465
oh said he that is life to me more more two drops more would kill you replied the abbé	90.6963
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon	82.5404
he was a strongminded upright young man	123.6486
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring	73.0280
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england	121.8153
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years then no misfortune has happened to you and what misfortune could happen to me	62.5627
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared	41.3650
leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	22.9651
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière	109.5079
in england the post was well served	219.8338
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling	137.9362
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance	139.2926
you have never seen our africans count said albert	79.4105
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to younay my prayeris to retain his friendship mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man i said mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever	111.2806
i make a match	143.2074
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear	126.1326
let us visit this one first added he	103.4712
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven oclock	67.7587
hush returned rochefort	568.7430
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishingboats with their white sails were alone visible	96.4737
do you understand me perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value thank you	100.2119
noirtiers happiness i interrupted valentine i shall not leave my grandfatherthat is an understood thing between us	235.8177
he entered by the faubourg st jacques under verdant arches	319.8087
the carriage stopped the footman sprang off the box and opened the door	40.2192
ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own	72.9018
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst dartagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis	122.1704
see paragraph below	2192.3660
well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which i have put on some vineleaves to please you wicked one	103.5974
thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment	67.9217
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for dartagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin	161.8865
mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions	54.0715
oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two months	510.3640
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon	169.4056
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his body	157.5104
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal	92.7373
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly	361.2466
while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no which he had occupied on his last stay at compiègne	164.4662
we discoursed a long time madame on different subjects of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous _aqua tofana_ of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick molière or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it	120.5931
was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand at this moment the clock struck six	112.1475
what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness i bitterly reproach myself i assure you well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips	208.4798
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages	161.2311
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i dont stand upon ceremony said dartagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep	154.5379
there they are the coachman turning around gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain	253.9051
rich	nan
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction	172.3164
for the present he had no anxiety	82.5084
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old yes but i could give him the orderi guitantand i preferred to give it to you guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier	99.0452
shall we wait or shall we charge let us charge them answered the gascon	183.6085
monsieur dartagnan said the _valetdechambre_	83.2192
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only trifles that was his favorite word	94.6074
the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night	77.9824
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well	78.2380
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow	111.5212
do not forget your crosses	179.9976
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand	72.4353
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	285.6254
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarinimpossible an italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves	77.3851
when he was completely dressed he said send hither monsieur dartagnan the valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before one might have fancied him an apparition	127.0985
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped	56.9051
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	139.6743
in a few minutes a night watch passed	148.9957
m	nan
see if he is still in the same place athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole	70.3523
come in tréville the duke saluted and retired	357.2779
open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk no reply	225.9524
i tell you valentines life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m	163.2908
he wore his elegant uniform dartagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the swiss was six feet high dartagnan was hardly more than five the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded dartagnan as an intruder	171.2552
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	336.8621
what shall we do said athos	47.3806
i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime this is not to the purpose said eugénie let us speak candidly sir i admire candor oh said danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice	158.3744
patience said athos i had a plan	31.5460
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with all sir have you the keys they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions very well and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you you may go but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken it is only fifty thousand francs everything included and your fee is included in this sum but have you not come from auteuil here yes certainly well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time	80.8359
and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal	80.5340
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do	53.9935
see the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed monsieur groslow and his companions sir replied mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere	93.5701
you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine villefort and davrigny exchanged looks	199.1706
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin i hope so and when will the dance begin the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until tomorrow morning you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier dhumieres has promised me whenever i need them upon fifty soldiers yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them good my dear rochefort but that is not all	108.3848
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth	62.5336
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosis and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz	132.7373
i beg your excellencys pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but i dont think im many minutes after my time ten oclock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan tis i who am too soon	157.8971
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession	113.1090
to my grandfathers room i in m	297.2690
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos	75.4382
dartagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal	83.3298
keep back my lord said dartagnan	32.5785
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	589.8080
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of monsieur dartagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur dartagnan shall not leave us the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he	77.6421
was completely at the mercy of these four men	70.1815
then he pointed to the door	14.1694
happily dartagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties	83.3166
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide prevent me then replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the counts iron grasp	171.4754
very well what did i say to you	23.2004
oh my former friends my former friends he murmured and fell with his face to the ground	82.0472
the king threw himself into an armchair	44.6189
albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs	105.2173
and you will tell him i will publish the report of boisrobert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade	61.5128
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession then said the count i refer you to your confessor	104.5659
no one has _brought_ a letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter i left it where i found it monsieur	82.4646
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone	97.8727
she loves him it was for his sake she has committed these crimes	91.0633
i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more	154.5886
what is the matter with you my friend asked the latter	19.0550
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family	88.4604
even before the coachman had hailed the _concierge_ the massy gates rolled on their hingesthey had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning	102.9754
there placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland but still on english soil the tents of a little army extended	216.5600
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	58.0556
we have had a narrow escape but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son	268.0678
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	154.7376
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited dartagnan to drink	126.2734
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	341.1962
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed aloud	72.1690
gave me some days before he died come i am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively	137.8204
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	51.1299
the ballet of la merlaison chapter xxiii	103.9192
am i not right m	85.6039
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london	193.8054
what could he say	60.9633
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me cried he	44.5023
what do you say m	25.2825
m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward	327.0776
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate	148.8261
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril	118.2571
you are not judges you cannot condemn me i offered you tyburn said lord de winter	93.5038
ah stop i have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to me tell us allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders athos made a sign for his lackey to approach	111.5504
impostor indeedm	3068.5642
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him	142.9471
with anne of austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for m	175.6641
there you must rest young people are such braggarts it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds	111.7937
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him	95.3480
it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle that you knew it and i was not informed of it that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament	90.4483
while waiting his assistance i trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her	128.3201
well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man	21.3950
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries	147.7934
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt	246.7566
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz	98.2798
in fact about four oclock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance	118.8247
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	36.8855
save me save me porthos and aramis arose	86.3190
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not m it does and is not above fifteen feet from it about that well then i will tell you what we must do	121.1835
well he shall live mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect themfar more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir	163.8472
gracious heavens exclaimed dantès what is the matter	30.6797
what are your grandmothers symptoms an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched	176.2062
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage	183.0691
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection	158.6026
i will not die alonei will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands	167.3447
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off	257.8089
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger	73.1319
it is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness	145.9070
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina	78.6599
so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box	101.0823
to wait replied athos	94.0278
cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends i am at your service sir replied the major	34.6150
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor	139.1210
come gentlemen come the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him	113.9901
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you i shall take better care of them myself answered dartagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape	151.9522
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt	258.6206
de tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen	96.7469
not the least in the world replied bonacieux	62.2259
can my influence with them be of any service to you oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless	146.6218
we have before stated that all the servants had fled	135.3765
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no champsélysées	101.2813
no but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted dont you think so dartagnan i think so indeed cried he	120.9123
ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder	130.4556
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew	59.4795
it has been made up a long time said gondy	70.9135
in the meantime my dear lucien here are cigarscontraband of coursetry them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves _peste_ i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable	138.7947
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m	121.6014
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	99.2203
this is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for i stand here to accuse you sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows	133.0184
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet	93.0030
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting	61.9070
ah good morning my dear count said he	42.6327
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven	117.6711
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything	223.1521
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of sanfelices steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in earrings necklaces and gold hairpins	157.0264
he said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	133.0715
dépinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry	89.5380
the man in the red cloak chapter lxv	100.4694
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves	196.7719
love me then haydée who knows	244.3568
how old is she inquired the vicomte de bragelonne	105.2580
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression	89.1627
monsieur returned maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgracea man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot	302.7647
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm	695.5524
no hermine replied debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the counts	74.2864
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace	204.5816
now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity or of wisdom my dear baronor of wisdom said louis xviii laughing the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the oceansee plutarchs life of scipio africanus m	174.7456
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	234.0314
never never i believe you said mme	106.6949
good dartagnan is for mazarin he said to himself	81.7234
i will however inform monsieur dartagnan of your arrival here comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery	81.0945
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an adder athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	210.4819
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen and what is your business madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais that is all i wished to know said the queen	50.6700
yez whats the dream said the swiss	103.5107
as to dartagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying	200.1623
take pity on me then and go oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself i should run mad	75.8269
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed	57.7365
be this evening about ten oclock at st cloud in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of m	49.2187
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him	186.3697
grimaud made a sign that he was going away	20.2986
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	110.7804
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word	77.8749
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage but dartagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him	149.3481
you are speaking you scoundrel said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look	97.8959
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	117.1763
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out	141.9126
moustons suggestion appear to you full of sense oh said aramis suppose the master is a puritan so much the better mordioux replied dartagnan if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens but if he should be a cavalier said porthos	73.0226
and now my dear girl said dartagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be here	30.0520
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed	123.8314
how can a young man live upon francs a month but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it the father will never repay it	110.8309
de monte cristo and myself possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	96.2613
i understand said monte cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions	135.5217
there are several branches of the dartagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty that is well	128.8464
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that dartagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place	125.9223
the whole establishment had been changed another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villeforts servicein fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family	144.9759
why did he kill himself instead of you	113.5286
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said dartagnan	86.5582
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being	86.3435
dartagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies	144.9804
m	nan
sir said villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m	114.3224
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god	224.7067
give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies allies said the queen shaking her head	120.7370
de villeforti intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house	197.9559
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune	42.1707
begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes very well it is your own doing	72.9608
richelieu slowly tore the paper which dartagnan had generously relinquished	261.7829
it was mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	165.7100
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the yacht	148.4716
as my sole heir	319.4306
he was dressed in violettinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color	69.1629
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him	52.0321
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	106.0934
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperors intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouchedmy friend said my mother when your masters orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you notyes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly	146.0472
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur i am a criminal as it appears	147.6261
and you monsieur du vallon yes you sir speak if you please said mazarin	60.0210
we can talk of it afterward then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed	91.0289
she might say that athos had hanged her but then athos would tell that she was branded	122.9551
de tréville his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative	92.8468
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment	59.1267
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the kings attorney but can you not say that sir	92.5164
peppino remained breathless	285.9255
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller	179.3137
let us wait for a dénouementfor the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court madame de longueville was persuaded	95.8287
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages eh eh said bonacieux slapping a plump round bag which returned of sound a money what do you think of this madame preacher whence comes that money you do not guess from the cardinal from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort the comte de rochefort why it was he who carried me off that may be madame and you receive silver from that man have you not said that that abduction was entirely political yes but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august	160.9766
mistress madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say i say you are a miserable creature continued mme	128.5697
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters	127.3688
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going	153.5010
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	107.6802
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	60.9358
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated explain yourself said grimaud	131.3976
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye not on your own account surely replied monte cristo for a man is above that sort of thing oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head	59.9196
no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner	52.6731
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortunebrilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any	205.6273
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow	84.2154
de tréville how the affair came to pass	64.7593
i do not hem said dartagnan there is some truth in what you say ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court but you speak of him not of his party his resources it is truethe queen is for him something in his favor but he will never have the king a mere child a child who will be of age in four years	107.6928
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey	114.8689
dartagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively	95.5429
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	147.2496
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuses and wrote the following letter to dartagnan dear friendi am about to set off with aramis on important business	84.2860
the interview for which i ask is of us two alone and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman	108.7384
i will ask the cardinal it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was he or i	65.4161
stay with grandpapa maximilian i promise you not to persuade them to stay m morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villeforts apartments and to hers	104.1819
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness	281.4972
_morbleu_ said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet _morbleu_ i wont be their dupe i will answer for it	124.7749
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the gravedigger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard	91.4797
davrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son villefort suffocating pressed the doctors arm	281.5330
reflect upon it dartagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that dartagnan carried into everything	271.2547
on the other hand mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded	569.9979
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud	1133.1610
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage you speak charmingly said porthos	211.3813
yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity i can do it said porthos	96.9614
at the moment of arriving at st paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself twice	141.0144
chapter xxv	50.8403
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter	156.9704
by me what was his name lord winter your uncle exclaimed cromwell	243.2913
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it	89.4754
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	147.6622
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you	42.2088
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful operaglass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass	152.0696
it is all one to usto us who do not command tomorrows expedition chatillon and flamarens looked at each other	119.0643
in conscience i cannot kill him and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me	137.9318
the popular banker found that it answered better than count	666.3959
i am a straightforward simple man thats my great disadvantage	136.2398
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman	60.2345
de nargonne had married m	295.2062
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take i have his letters said she	212.9282
en route monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction dartagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier	107.8651
m	nan
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure	127.2397
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french	147.6887
bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it	98.3700
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble	135.5915
i had only to cry out help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free why didnt you do it asked the lieutenant	68.1277
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	41.4883
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody	82.9571
her mouth was small and rosy and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt	183.4524
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo	117.5446
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him	79.8936
but since the end of the month m	39.5564
mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers	682.5602
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison m oh pardon me sir let me live she is cowardly said villefort	132.2354
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his lifes best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison meantime mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke	277.1554
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose	167.2339
private secretary to a minister plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battlefields with his sword and his victories possessing fiveandtwenty thousand francs a year besides your place a horse for which châteaurenaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockeyclub and other diversions can you not amuse yourself	235.0497
hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of st gervais and do not bow too low to this italian that might give him a poor idea of you good answered porthos	118.8291
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you you will bring him then	33.4217
aha said groslow on account of political opinions	258.0291
ah my poor friend i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twentytwo years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh	96.8744
i received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact i rendered him	96.8589
he will set sail tomorrow morning fort la pointe or fort vasou was not built until nearly years later	863.8394
i told you so said dartagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it and you monsieur dartagnan what do you want my lord said dartagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant yes and you would be gratified if cardinal mazarin should make you captain dartagnan bowed	69.2383
well sir said morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and i have nothing further to tell you i see returned the englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you oh sir cried morrel	70.8882
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy you madame said dartagnan affecting surprise is that possible my godgood and beautiful as you are a mortal enemy indeed an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death	111.8007
before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with terror	142.0168
i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write	148.4771
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerfs defence	39.2895
as for his suspicions once on _terra firma_ once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite	191.8954
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key	89.1120
in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress	109.3661
what say you morrel _ma foi_ he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready	145.6306
étienne said he see why mademoiselle eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawingroom and why she makes me wait so long having given this vent to his illhumor the baron became more calm mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawingroom as the spot	163.6656
yes before witnesses oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it there has been a crime said monte cristo	93.3833
is that what you wish for asked she	79.4620
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	122.1194
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter	97.2120
what wants your excellency of me inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard	107.6041
nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers live the guards m	300.0472
i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole	109.1403
and you shall be alone replied the young man	18.6515
we bear witness to this said the two musketeers with one voice	138.1657
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions well what next said dartagnan laughing in spite of himself	287.3371
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage	204.8477
the comte de la fere she cried	25.6591
she asked dartagnan if he had a mistress	48.2554
ali bring me some water the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting	134.5728
felton lowered his head and reflected	41.5542
you cannot guess said he what there is in that small vase can you no i really cannot well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it	257.5123
i have seen him that is he i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak the devil said athos musingly	72.3630
very brave said monte cristo i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head and i know he has fought two duels said morrel	64.3759
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m	103.8255
descend my lord said the man in the moat	26.0684
ah my mother my poor mother said albert gazing through his tears at his mothers portrait if you know this how much must you suffer come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal	146.5822
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	139.9763
may i congratulate you the affair is still in projection and he who says in projection means already decided said debray	144.2679
he lodges at the hôtel des princes	68.2513
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oftrepeated assurance of the _concierge_ that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	87.4833
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	142.3561
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god	204.2701
he sent us home in his own carriage	114.8098
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs	58.5708
here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs	95.2702
de tréville it had disappeared	45.2276
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness	78.0819
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	74.2931
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	161.3077
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villeforts room who had said she would receive them there	59.4643
the cardinal writes better than i thought	218.3550
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of _my friends_this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myselfthis young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look	106.2909
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	62.2078
no dont be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured	58.6901
the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy	275.0260
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head	183.7516
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love	236.6788
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of you are right aramis let us travel on to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	144.7155
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	68.3114
noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed	59.2406
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else tis well danglarstis well replied m	235.7481
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues	103.3016
hes a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hairgrease hed take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant	328.2912
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself	69.4156
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your courseyou have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend help cried caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally woundedi may not die perhaps they can yet save my life your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead	169.4481
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance	46.5931
you start for paris	408.2082
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes	125.7608
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service i have certain apprehensionswell what is the meaning of that in fact a great noise was heard in the antechamber at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming my lord the cardinal my lord the cardinal mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors	57.7792
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	231.7479
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative	109.9335
chapter viii	87.1937
but i cannot said she i am not strong enough do you shut it ah you do well to ask said eugénie laughing i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle darmilly passed the bolt of the padlock through	82.1376
keep the commission dartagnan the profession of arms suits you	207.7491
on entering the bankers mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m	148.9157
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion egad said dartagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousquetonit is a vulgar pleasurebut i shoot sometimes that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits really how very amusing	166.8721
yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing dartagnan now no longer counted the sighs	98.4344
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting	85.1148
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athoss chamber and that of the park	60.5892
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her	323.1872
dartagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin you he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber	105.4109
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his part ah my dear sir whatafter the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing	92.5430
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance	103.9926
dartagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time	79.0237
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality	160.4592
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his and these men are in france my lord i believe so tell me their names perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them one of them was called the chevalier dartagnan ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier dartagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of	81.8649
his vessel	807.9999
he opened the door quickly and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild	115.9502
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready yes answered the englishmen and the frenchmen as with one voice	117.9910
is he rich hes the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london and knows lansquenet adores it basset his mania biribi revels in it good said porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening the more so as it will be the prelude to a better how so we invite him to play tonight he has invited us in return tomorrow	177.4459
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	227.3066
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre	122.0774
that was five years ago	24.3833
germain pillon was a famous french sculptor	813.1835
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	57.2557
oh lackadaisy im beginning to feel queer cried blaisois	636.8146
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	85.5811
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier	210.6879
that is never done	66.1929
penelon replied julie go and inform m	221.7627
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised	93.2830
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise oh my god listen	71.9667
is the baroness at home inquired danglars	198.1511
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses	53.4219
who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamplight a shadow approaching his chief	135.3964
as for myself i can assure you of one thingthe more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other	121.5436
oh my god my god you see my strength fails me you see plainly i cannot walk	104.2961
cavalcanti i do not know him viscount you do not know him no i never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him but you receive him at your house that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbé who may be deceived	57.3318
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good shall i take any arms for what purpose any money it is useless	170.4285
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police	92.0993
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	102.4345
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	428.4727
but said andrea illtemperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating	137.3380
m	nan
this is not the hôtel des princes come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired baker caderousse sighed	125.1756
arriving at the faubourg st antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille but as it was the bastille alone he looked at he did not observe milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two illlooking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him	88.2034
if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement	77.3812
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonias	64.7195
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz	74.0946
there he stopped breathless and panting	363.3674
well said the count what are you doing you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do what may that be we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them do not concern yourself about that we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there after the execution cried franz	78.6309
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and fortyeight hours to stay there that makes three weeks	156.6541
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the sofa	142.9693
and did you catch any of his words i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect	115.3251
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue denfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed	100.2016
morrel	nan
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise	355.6588
what an awakening for the parisians said the queen radiant	192.1183
i see no one and yet the ladder didnt come down of itself no it is bazin ah ah said dartagnan	145.0023
he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions yes signified the old man	85.2411
but not before one oclock replied dartagnan	163.2921
is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement	102.0740
that time you had nothing to say to me i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second	43.9733
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m	229.2506
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi	170.3905
a dinner in the old style	98.4589
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him	20.6779
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal	98.4750
dartagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since then said athos in a tone of delight he is well	60.2687
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of bloodit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart	182.1479
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion	141.0018
yes monsieur said dartagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business speak then i am all attention it concerns nothing less said dartagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen what did you say asked m	64.0299
adieu count till tomorrow but the night is dark said athos perceiving that lord de winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no servant i have tony a safe if simple youth halloo there grimaud olivain and blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with you blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province	213.0380
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled	154.2337
only i warn you that when i reside in a country i conform to all its code and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake oh do not do that excellency i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair	76.9296
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses danglars took advantage of caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saintvictor staggering as he went	123.4260
he was a simplelooking lawyers clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener	208.2502
noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find	220.4966
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one	114.7165
dartagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings whereas mme	68.0959
i shall call you presently patrick went out	223.1072
toward the town of louvres was the reply	42.4642
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	81.1251
egad one would think it had been placed here on purpose get on it thats it friend and dartagnan coughed	270.1135
twentythree thousand francs said she	39.8432
de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said	110.2238
no nolook look m the recommendation was needless	491.1020
still further in buckinghams lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme	235.3574
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again	47.4037
dartagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver	75.4340
call mr felton said he	131.1825
i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening morrel went also to the notary who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening	107.3327
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	228.0802
at other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb him	112.4043
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	326.3958
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair	85.7511
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean	118.8350
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued	56.0271
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	49.4581
prove it danglars	321.3831
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well are we softened a little	126.7582
to be imprisoned	153.4645
oh this is too much cried milady	57.5252
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by dartagnan and porthos	103.6427
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade	123.3886
de tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his word	71.9013
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly	281.2209
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk	175.9379
egad yes but why dont you come there also athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here	114.4033
therefore kitty surrendered	4021.3335
he had now leisure to look to his wound	123.0474
this young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition what occupies him in england he is one of cromwells most enthusiastic disciples but what attached him to the cause	155.7680
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness	146.1982
formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman but now it was a different thing he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general	121.1805
shall we return to the camp said porthos	30.7911
ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind	171.3622
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare	91.5974
in whose name do you come said he to him	49.3104
hold hold i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were i open them again and i see what you are nowa hundred times more beautiful what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances and upon what then must i live	128.3314
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	93.3038
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning	191.8041
a burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder felton uttered a groan	168.5227
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison	93.4285
certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real innocence	125.4930
you were speaking of the champsélysées just now worthy fosterfather well well in the champsélysées there resides a very rich gentleman at whose house you robbed and murdered did you not i believe i did the count of monte cristo tis you who have named him as m	127.5023
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on dartagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face	107.0066
la chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles and if you can find them bring them to me	75.9325
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy father and mercédès come said the abbé closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by	115.2379
himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtierhis arrival at marseilles and interview with his fatherhis affection for mercédès and their nuptual feasthis arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château dif from this point everything was a blank to dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	189.8804
on his part aramis wrote a long letter	112.3050
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing	91.1968
de la trémouilles domestics in daring to make a _sortie_ upon the kings musketeers	90.7315
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	264.9268
bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at st cloud and not elsewhere before the destréess pavilion and not in another street	118.4245
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him	86.3545

yes madame are you ready i am and his eminence the cardinal has got off without any accident	117.1249
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and illdefined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic	101.4256
he smiles at them	287.2023

my dear fellow dont speak like that of monsieur groslow	103.2779

lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient bertuccio bowed and left the room	106.7960
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them really said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment	63.2777
valentine oh heaven forbid woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy on yourself then unhappy man on yourself i am the only guilty person am i not said maximilian	510.7279

this door was a mockery to the _concierge_ from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_ opening at the _sesame_ of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	139.0087
we have a king ten years old who doesnt yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farmthat is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarins hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes	189.0804
now as they had already traveled eleven leagues dartagnan thought it time to stop whether porthos were or were not in the inn	217.7447
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	281.5068

besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess	89.8371
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way	215.7452
now as dartagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his	112.7082

for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one other woman who can do it as well	189.9207
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him	78.5275

i knew you were a corsican	104.3256

they accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left albert started for naples	144.1068
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends	258.2752
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty	184.8475
let us go said he it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight oclock a carriage was in readiness at the door	55.6423
alberts lips scarcely whispered goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	632.0891
if you do i swear to you for i have got to the end of my strength that i will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with how old are you	43.7437
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat	84.2817
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said dartagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant	55.5053
the others my lord the secondi heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the comte de la fere	219.6838
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up thats all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers	130.8661
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road	76.2603
we engaged our word our word included everything	1257.6510
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	115.2619
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden	65.5784
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead	307.5383
and now remember one thing monsieur officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or illadvised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness m i promised him to wait replied morrel and i will wait at this moment barrois entered	105.3581
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus	115.1360
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before haydée	286.3291
really said dartagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts athos i cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that way	139.9483
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word	83.4310
one thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders	123.7005
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mailcoach	136.7695
athos was right	102.6318
i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase	106.0661

andrea was supported by two priests	234.7246
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	132.4817
a knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied felton	77.4378
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place what was the cause of your quarrel when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends why do you not seek revenge i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre and what was the result of those duels the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound the englishman turned down his shirtcollar and showed a scar whose	116.8934
redness proved it to be a recent one	125.2498
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been	215.2985
and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight	213.4626
the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia _faïences_ and palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv	213.2774

oh no sir said madame danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality m ah yes said monte cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination	62.6312

goodmorning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian did you doubt it said the young captain	59.5825

the baron came forward	243.4583
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects	378.6765
whither are you taking me asked he	56.1374
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	135.1940
there are ten men to accompany you	58.9910
dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek	104.5597
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand yes said dartagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you cant think that dartagnan dartagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	139.9948
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain sure to gain repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count	203.9153
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	126.9469
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon and what did monsieur dartagnan reply monsieur dartagnan promised me his assistance but i soon found out that he was betraying me you impose upon justice	149.7431
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	95.5110
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the _lorgnette_ and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	180.0084
i was worn out with fatigue	106.0021
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen	73.6604
stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for me having thus spoken dartagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	190.3984
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant elkobbir assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your masters blood look gentlemen all these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the counts forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt alis blood still lingering there	169.1412
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order on our account said the three musketeers	86.0192
and you killed her the monk exclaimed	192.1722
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind	96.2455
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal	77.1199
come come madame cried dartagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	123.8413
above this floor was a large _atelier_ which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitionsa pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for preeminence	97.7522
the curate then entered followed by planchet	387.1030
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips the queen did not wear her diamond studs	76.8431
what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated no returned the count	97.5686
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag	234.1607
silence said dartagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him	74.7626
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurators wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory	74.8914
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur dherblay i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me really monsieur you say strange things said aramis	73.1484
noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all	106.5643
m oh thank me again said the count tell me till you are weary that i have restored you to happiness you do not know how much i require this assurance oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said valentine and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée ask my beloved sister haydée who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you you then love haydée asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate	104.5509
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwells	232.4783
oh how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his hand and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your dutyselim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atomsthe troops were firing from underneath	104.1554
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named	54.5791
it was m	55.1100
when dartagnan returned to the palais royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing	66.1057
i raised my head i was in utter darkness	199.8731
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped	39.2886
ah there you are my good darminges i have given you a great fright have i not	93.0256
morrel called her and she ran to the gate	44.4791
come said dartagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing dartagnan what is to be done	45.5574
no it had just struck four	148.5852
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting	95.8620
it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body	130.3995
but this is not to the purposeour business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium	99.2394

noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night	55.4092
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet	58.1562
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head	96.6629
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets	71.3157

in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another	301.7025
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenants sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal	66.0405
for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks	94.8413
this is what was done	104.1479
he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty	146.5529
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows	254.3219

now by way of having a restingplace during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookerywhich has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many yearsand obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name	236.6394

as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her anger	83.5639
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieillechapelle and la venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	120.0642
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is	94.5799
my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	151.7116
while the struggle between day and night lasted dantès still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	118.0376
yes hes not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow hell defend himself well we must try to take him alive	148.4407

a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again	258.9067

when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist	198.0081
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	39.3456
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france	144.0317
the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building reecho with the sound of his friends name	105.7119
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foots pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles	76.6432
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert	149.2382

bonacieux starting	10287.2334
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	125.1973
you understand that interested as i am in this affair i cannot see it in the same light as you do	50.0797
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers actions	776.0765

in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters	137.5098
davrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited her	85.0958
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	148.0886
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	100.9323
yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coqhéron villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again	78.9736
the island was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery glance afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean	126.5783

the count de guiche was awakened at five oclock in the morning by raoul who came to wish him goodday	71.2664
the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence andlet us admit itthe involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak	223.6389
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father very well you are always the same athos great and generous	135.6727
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain it is my intention so to do come let us hear you	95.5152
bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition	267.0099
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion	141.0041

oh it would be a sacrilege	64.5509
yes but i am expecting some one a friend of athos a friend exclaimed the count	71.1957
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body	220.6237
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness	127.9614
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height	98.6175
then valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds	159.9386
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth	307.4068
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them	115.6090

in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual	144.7856
but what ails you father	221.1220
abraham raised the knife against isaac and isaac was his son yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain cromwell bowed	130.7816
but to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat danglars without telling them there is a stranger	96.5898

danglars any reason ah there is your proud and selfish nature	472.5746
do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor do not exaggerate the service i have the happiness to render your majesty	48.5740
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating	186.4958
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night and where do the servants sleep oh they have a house to themselves	136.2800
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	239.8419
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	163.0161
the interview	2426.7534
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise	167.3955

when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the goodlooking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination	122.7699
dartagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished	145.6584
the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man	240.2925
because she had been branded continued dartagnan	66.6452
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	52.3527
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt	182.5329
misfortune refreshes the memory	193.8931

milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate	87.6123
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	65.9442

devil take it he muttered to himself dont let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them well then said athos what are your schemes	103.7661
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris	58.0448

let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear dartagnan very good said dartagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous dartagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there	122.6587
the nightlamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimneypiece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned	149.3677

lucullus dines with lucullus porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner but wine was wanting the bottle was empty	137.0940
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks	173.9617
the one you bought will then become useless to you nearly so and you selected it yourself with the greatest care	267.4369
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majestys guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friends and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majestys service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized	114.8619
that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majestys service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur	136.4477
athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal	52.5058

at a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free ah by jove my lord said dartagnan you have well said but these are only words	81.6430

five minutes after the door had been closed on morrels entrance it was again opened for the count	53.0196

you are illshall i ring for assistanceshall i call no said villefort rising hastily stay where you are	197.0692
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding	65.3683
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowlingpiece which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree	130.7726
but we know very well what had become of edmond	81.9564
at the hour agreed upon groslow came	234.2496
ah traitor muttered dartagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix	166.8491
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man whoa rather improbable thinghad stolen his fathers letter from himwas there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred	367.6678
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this dartagnan is right said athos here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i dont know where	137.1611
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire	146.0076
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at least	92.1050
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said athos	81.4500
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze	93.8813

from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil	116.7453
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself demolished	134.9150
he remained listening and gazing	219.2204

what dost thou there rascal asked comminges	869.8664
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell	152.6793

to think of the parisians soliloquized dartagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or aliveif alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs	143.4127
de villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance	151.4998

this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs deau cest bien prouvé par le déluge you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand	177.0286
i see you require proofs	257.0651
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar	165.0372

bricconi muttered he	82.3299
his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth	95.1355
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear	199.5807

mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor	97.7865
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue you are stupid replied the cardinal	95.7561
i desire to know what is the meaning of this be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars	70.6174
the man who abducted my wife the cardinal rang a second time	112.6223
then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydée is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes because my lord said haydée eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to knowhow she had become the slave of the count	103.4403
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car	156.8637

darted from his eyes	27.2878
now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarterday payment and scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pensionoffice but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give monsieur scarron	105.5907

he was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the saintlazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness	92.0399
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his friends	43.5269

it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler	162.6150
not with us sir replied dantès	137.4680
dartagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said	111.4321

cavalcanti in italy the nobility generally marry young	778.4763
m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need	161.8411

mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle darmilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events	151.0654

but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of dartagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer	69.1215
as to porthosoh as to porthos faith thats a droll affair and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passersby offended no one	127.3407

oh those figures how well i remember them i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free	94.8632
but said dartagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money	83.1595
i am sufferingi cannot see	150.9448

i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than thathe has made himself understood how was such a thing possible by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil goodmorning madame said the count bowing	100.5268

it is gods pleasure that things should be so the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce	128.8118
he then formed a resolution	201.6339

this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder	287.5363
dartagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence	67.4040
it was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again	170.8713
at that moment dartagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look	105.2931
curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramiss room	110.9580

but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyonehost waiter or hostlercoming to hold his stirrup or take his horse dartagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman wellmade and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect	140.7025
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy	242.9412
his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure	111.0696

if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star	103.2528
i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much	151.2295
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window dont open the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture	175.4911

monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped	80.6519
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	140.8669

i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above anothers	120.1929

what an idea where is the letter you speak of	88.2984
the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue	57.4282
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sicklylooking	207.9393
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead	49.2048
he is here who miladys son athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence does grimaud know him then no but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him the headsman of bethune exclaimed de winter	121.5137

they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty swordthrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years at	136.2947
your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you who is it it is monsieur dartagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise	199.7167
it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle that is to say at the other end of france	44.6575
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel	184.4558
how so returned the count with surprise	92.9316
at the same moment whilst dartagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase	91.7672
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination	142.1933

dartagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction stay you where you are and dont you stir or i will pull this ear off	167.2628
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	119.1384

the workmen	3864.1895
dantès saluted villefort and retired	204.9108

what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsars _commentaries_ and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six oclock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankers at a quarter past six i should have ceased	185.7494

the instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m	106.0702
the next morning dartagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer	216.5108
ah pardon i thought so but we will return to my lord duke presently	132.2604
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet dartagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme	121.4453
i accelerate your ruin	799.2474

it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	155.3560
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act	158.3159
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers	76.8941
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning	75.0205
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian	175.6609

as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the wellbeing of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man	152.4129
excellent there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux suppose we ask these englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest blaisois	199.5410
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going on	101.2252
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars	93.3428
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible	133.4191
see what is going on monsieur dartagnan said he	47.9799

why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered can i believe my ears cried the marquise	191.8373
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room	124.0165
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	120.1291
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade ah said madame de villefort why did he not take wine	115.9573
well tomorrow i am on guard in stuarts room yes come and pass the night with me impossible impossible why so i play with monsieur du vallon every night	162.4734
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless	75.4385
we are compelled to admit to our readers that dartagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be	55.5894
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances dartagnan was the only man who could relieve the queens uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur dartagnan at once	97.9451
however proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the othersthat is in order to make war against us	94.7806
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis	103.9888

i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence	151.8077

the rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis	287.0389
while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound miladys hands together	179.3508

they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs the crowd began to murmur and approached the house	141.1953
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road	159.7472
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse	122.4732
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by miladys pulse that the case was not serious	233.7776
dartagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying thats a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice	221.2451
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound	127.5852

this is a detail preserved to us by brienne	199.8595
you know it is you alone whom i love how can i know that by the scorn i will throw upon her dartagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them	108.6732
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please god to france where at least i understand the architecture of the houses so suiting the action to the word dartagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others	105.6745

very good said the count	14.5104
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched is it then so terrible a poison oh no in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies what then is it a skilful preparation of my friends the worthy abbé adelmonte who taught me the use of it oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable antispasmodic perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and i frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence	154.2967
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens	132.4013
dartagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m	69.5210
the postchaise was happily bought three days since have you had it sent where we are to go for it yes our passport here it is and eugénie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read m	241.6808

what do i see that he wouldnt swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldnt swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers	118.4141
at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom	102.0670
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post	108.9575

more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard	122.9105
the château dif the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dantès right and the other on his left	94.4645
this insolent boy chastises others cried he and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his brow	108.3350
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on	44.6061
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple	145.9699
in the cloverfields beyond the chestnuttrees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song	249.6165
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him alas you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough	68.2965
my dear albert said debray rising it is halfpast two	68.5859
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him	88.6564
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it i guessed it but too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that i am felton made no resistance	113.1976
no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame de villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m	69.3850
good lord try one throw one throw is soon made and if i lose you will win but if i lose well you will surrender the harnesses have with you for one throw said dartagnan	313.8541
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london	41.5952
a kind of steward appeared just as dartagnan and his companions were prepared to mount	107.9322
it is useless then to attempt anything with him	75.9550
ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of fiveandtwenty	118.9058
but dartagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts	340.0699
when i hear misfortunes named madame he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind	199.0234
i will call salvieux and make him write the letter be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour tell your coachman to stop at the door you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle renée whom i leave on such a day with great regret you will find them both here and can make your farewells in person a thousand thanksand now for the letter the marquis rang a servant entered	107.9317
my lord excuse me i speak as i can i restrain myself	84.7208
do not seek your wife read dartagnan she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her	75.6354
what do you think of this he asked in a low voice	23.1053
some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more	562.8301
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay	104.7863
de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess	25.2094
the counts tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere	159.6269
but andrea drew a cigarcase from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking	197.4230

but i as you see am nailed to my bedah this demon goutthis demon gout my lord said athos we are just arrived from england and our first concern is to inquire after your health thanks gentlemen thanks as you see my health is but indifferent	211.1446
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vainthey opened again as soon as shut	151.1453
now said the count let us follow him franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley	50.0228
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god	217.3926
dartagnan came the next day to miladys and finding her in a very illhumor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m	101.0043
joy shone in raouls eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle	114.3879
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	145.7778
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he therefore went forward without a moments hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half	185.0479
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	146.8290
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed dartagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthoss adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramiss had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead	120.6263

the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor	569.8093

danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers	118.5939
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m	344.7670
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition	55.3091
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlets stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir she was my mother her crimes i know them not her disorders i know them not her vices i know them not	189.3580

well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable then you have some other motive unknown to us athos smiled and dartagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head	130.9983
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	174.8392

bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her	301.7617
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal m i understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	167.7424
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	103.7323

be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion	69.9579
this silence selfcontrol and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face	336.2643
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues	156.2504
well be it so at length said eugénie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is i see him the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty	106.1004

while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him davrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	70.5925
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him wretch exclaimed haydée her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery did not you know that my dear lord something of this i heard in epirus said monte cristo but the particulars are still unknown to me	92.2720

aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion	56.3237
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars	65.0046
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	35.9205
and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this	61.2619
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did add to that dartagnans rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth and here we are at the ninth	103.0448
the parliament we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament both orleans and montargis are ours	256.0775
but was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards	123.7391

your eminence may believe added dartagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little	99.8901
comminges saw that he was undecided	48.6195
i wrote the word _finis_ at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week ago	96.8863
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced	133.5044

milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	102.2220
then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required athos would no more give him his handathos would renounce him	118.2605
he took her for the queen said dartagnan	47.0962
de tréville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence but why should i have done otherwise	194.9074
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor	87.4194
and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	80.1212
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expectedone is weak	193.4161

we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	87.5376
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured	47.4956
anne of austria sought to read in mazarins face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired	126.1639

and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess we understand each other perfectly then	121.9476
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage	107.1076
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness	396.4505

a deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to paris but she not only declined to receive the deputies but sent an intimation by chancellor seguier implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel paris would be besieged the very next day	124.1616
mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds passreflections like thoughts of the heavens	123.0075
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan	255.2308
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea	100.4563
what would the abbé please to have	71.7210
dartagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	156.9603
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	666.2809
her very self she gave it me last night	429.8407
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said dartagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought what monsieur cried dartagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason	85.6314
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demigod has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man	86.2077
sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentines marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded noirtiers countenance remained immovable	92.9835
soon he saw the lights of la consigne	75.3435
and why not	199.6986
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden i dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy well replied athos have you not heard what dartagnan said what did he say demanded porthos	150.7492
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selims fiery lance	127.1307
he took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids	51.7912
that is our brave musketeer i think said the cardinal	54.0798
he asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the host	102.5681
but let us wait a little and reflect	86.7442
yes sir and it was a fierce one his highness the prince charged eleven times in person he is a great commander bragelonne he is a hero sir	134.1746
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side good thought dartagnan in this direction i am satisfied he pressed aramiss hand and went in search of porthos	128.8572
do you wish me to leave said morrel sadly	64.9718
i sometimes dream thats all	1569.6790
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to dartagnan	85.2652
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off	127.3722
dart	nan
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tearmoistened eyes raised to heaven	96.6111
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied	86.2652
ah yes said faria the penknife	84.0533
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returningthat will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	113.0584
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this den set your mind at rest replied athos	150.9273
it is to throw ourselves into the wolfs jaws said aramis	117.3950
dartagnan sprang back the wall had closed again	163.5294
how has this terrible past been recalled cried villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame alas said hermine doubtless it is chance chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this	162.8796
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart	166.9382

when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you	151.9685
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwiseif he treated me diplomaticallythat is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupantshe would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever	114.5507
at this instant the door opened	16.5705
what do you say to that i might answer sire that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to himbut upon one condition sire what it is that your majesty will make him come here will interrogate him yourself _têteàtête_ without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke what then you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say yes sire you will accept his judgment undoubtedly and you will submit to the reparation he may require certainly la chesnaye said the king	84.4987

the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him you have no idea then morrel asked châteaurenaud you do not propose anything oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay you have a sister asked the count	87.1114
dartagnan and which she had given her son secretly	160.2798
m well baron said he here i am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker	132.7995
then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course	163.5771
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectatori who was watching the working of this mournful tragedyi who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart morrel groaned	239.4733

nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves	158.1568
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank	96.9396
yes returned aramis	134.8572
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignitiesthe comte de la fere comte de bragelonne and he has no children with all these titles ah said porthos i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly what athos	98.6007
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible	124.0478
but he did not succeed	27.3856
he turned and saw julie	153.1732
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotionof a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned youis that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	76.1191
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horsesone for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern	101.4234

he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	291.3624
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time	38.2506

porthos wanted to follow him	46.3274
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	88.1117
it seems a likely story to me and to me too besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain	157.5409

yes replied noirtier	204.8105
dartagnan returned and again attacked him	148.0699
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime	152.6887

then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you proceed said monte cristo	80.3889
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply	69.7174
oh why did i not tell you all	43.4057
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto	239.1137

we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box you see plainly that i have no sword said the englishman	117.6921
hence it resulted when dartagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard	120.5344

the king called the cardinal	48.4183
this letter had been conveyed by dartagnan and had arrived in time	49.9972
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life	152.4000

during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	52.1679
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again	173.3715
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	89.9104
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	151.7406
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded	240.9433

why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the _si_ as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal	211.1980
in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived de winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation	109.8841

i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintancetwo of my good friends lord wilmore and the abbé busoni	100.4533

it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinals guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur dartagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him	127.9902
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m	62.5278
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them	146.0122

the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine oclock	96.7576
there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul	128.2941
porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street	244.1796
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it	155.7788
nevertheless she remained motionless	79.3792
and that is the only reply you make	54.6158
no it does not concern me	29.7389
andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully not badly by any means said the young man i was born for a diplomatist well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive	102.8999
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you sir sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies	116.8979
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no faith said madame de chevreuse say on	75.1117
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a womans happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings	156.8302
both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into miladys apartment before nine oclock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london	153.1734
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad	71.2344
in a moment he was on the ground	17.8271

my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock	91.6941
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	71.1146
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money full dress said the major half aloud	77.5186
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of dartagnan and porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile	126.3997
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away	86.8208
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions	895.3853
de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a kings attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been _enceinte_ six	192.6965
there are the horses	81.3392
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said dartagnan that matters little	85.3023
you know about that cried athos astonished	127.3564
to wait replied athos	94.0278
there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity	93.5218
aramis shuddered	355.2717
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight	241.7854
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis	83.7198
i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery	89.2116
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty no no blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and _pardieu_ you know his fathers name his father yes noirtier noirtier the girondinnoirtier the senator he himself and your majesty has employed the son of such a man blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	139.9047
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for _terra firma_ and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them	160.1980
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line	121.0908
he urged the horse again into a trot	141.8852
go i will ask his servant bonacieux reentered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to dartagnans door and knocked	94.1213
supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of goodhumor illumined the face of dartagnan	114.5733
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours	70.6394
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more	87.6036
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming i follow you m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlinis part	296.6309
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder	113.1490
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii	123.7956
in twentyfour hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards	118.8843
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her	88.9544
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern	37.7100
then m	218.5588
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned	111.4253
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass	147.7113
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait	38.3499
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage	85.6721
a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the womans face became visible	53.6326
then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly free	123.9233
just then a patrol rode up	238.6845
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre at one oclock this morning she had not returned my god what can have become of her then we shall know be assured	100.3297
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a moments silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness	168.8035
i beg your pardon said aramis noticing his awkwardness if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardeners ladder but for me alone this is good enough sir said planchet when he saw dartagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you in case of necessity i might also climb up but my two horses cannot mount the ladder take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food	98.2969
and madame de morcerf to your dinner i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good why so because it is the air she always breathed in her youth monte cristo took no notice of this illnatured remark	96.1757
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakenedif conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if a conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of courage	198.0536
morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons	247.4555
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbélike all other abbés and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royaleegad you know about it was i not your second cried dartagnan	77.1780
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat what said athos no fish at a seaport they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos	159.6138
m	nan
he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor	134.4697
a thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected and rising also he went off at a quick pace	109.7675
was there not some snare laid for her	197.2399
remain parry	4201.3394
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleons downfall	448.1439
in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will	114.9968
m so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this	90.2719
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	202.7625
the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman	61.4593
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu	96.5663
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep	166.3291
then your grace knows her real name asked felton in a sharp tone	130.9429
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince	205.9436
day came the jailer entered	265.0926
the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality	248.4844
in a few minutes laporte came into the room	35.0923
well has anybody come out no but somebody has gone in a man or a woman a man ah ah said dartagnan there are two of them then i wish there were four said athos the two parties would then be equal perhaps there are four said dartagnan	132.1137
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves	70.1257
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow debrays example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous ah you do not know with what i am threatened	96.4747
de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned	68.8481
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble	119.4226
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurators wife was obliged to give place to the king	123.3087
as soon as his engagement with the patron of _la jeune amélie_ ended he would hire a small vessel on his own accountfor in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastresand under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo	106.0816
it is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the rest	106.0569
he crossed the court ran up the two flights to athoss apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it down	72.4357
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home	542.9963
scarcely however had he touched edmonds hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house	86.0898
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately	75.2668
lead us grimaud grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the cavalcade	132.0155
directly afterwards the moon rose	191.1546
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing	139.3814
the blow was sped by dartagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	138.8508
how very astonishing cried he at length	185.4929
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him	52.2422
unluckily as i was then in bearn on account of my fathers death the letter followed me there	88.7020
i am doing what is right the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with dartagnan	95.4447
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely	60.5792
the moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained	209.4575
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart yes replied mme	59.5803
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m	74.8249
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation	116.1421
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he	117.4424
do you understand it now athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmens clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and dartagnan a hammer and some nails	140.3186
speak said the queen	12.5002
what the devil could that handkerchief signify placed where he was dartagnan could not perceive the face of aramis	221.8044
de tréville who was returning from st germain he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers	133.1451
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams	72.5965
if i have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity me but your mother asked the president	120.2461
the gascon and the italian	123.4191
yes his mother but does he know this secret then i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges thus speaking he fell back exhausted	158.3065
our blow has failed for tonight let us withdraw	342.4494
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use	136.3062
noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy	141.4866
pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word _unlimited_ in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo	195.6711
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes because you do not love me madame if you loved me you would view all this otherwise	119.6065
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon	131.7345
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	140.0975
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect	114.0512
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and dartagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning	151.4494
he rushed toward dartagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms	57.2481
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	95.7512
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six oclock in the morning	40.6687
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed	81.9675
i enclose a draft for livres payable on m	298.4179
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned	105.3317
edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawingroom my dear i wish to speak to your mamma madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries	83.3476
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed	93.3326
arrived at the staircase it was still worse	55.9780
and dauphiné sir inquired the king of villefort	176.4762
the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began	77.4488
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival	123.7742

he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him	105.4288
just now dartagnan continued you were disguisedi mean to say attiredas a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered oh sir said dartagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question	97.6706

he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st germain	104.3079
mercy said caderousse crossing himself	94.1466

sblood does that astonish you and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method	118.6493
with the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month	34.4085
the cardinal therefore rose to open it	92.0639
she goes into england said athos	115.3819
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice miladys condescension	156.0928
_pardieu_ said he here is a strange thing since when i wonder in the musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it since said dartagnan they have friends who ask it for them ah ah said porthos it appears theres something fresh here yes we are going said aramis	145.0615
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish	147.4571

what the devil are you doing here count accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee	166.5562
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	187.8484
doubtless although less evident monte cristos joy was not less intense	570.7068
a better idea however came into her mind before going to bed	229.6077
valentine repeated the same voice	73.0483
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice	42.5542
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion	164.0000
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way	124.4189
never said dartagnan	23.3406
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me anything well then my dear count present me to your princess i will do so but on two conditions i accept them at once the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers i give you my oath that i will not enough viscount you will remember	96.6399
those two vows will you not	85.2465
ah you is it	68.3521
you are abused sir but that is not the question	49.8547
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome	58.2647
spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will	218.5040
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	122.0356
you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own	57.3635
yes keen and cutting politeness	3630.6340
his first cry was for his father but that father was dead my father too is dead said morrel	104.0322
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated	105.0485
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m	66.6804
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul	121.2520
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush	274.0035
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball	104.1116
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privationhe was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness	111.9988
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will	152.3814
what then are you i am about to tell you wretched man oh mon dieu i am john francis de winter i do not know you said the executioner	41.9787
do you preach them no i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself i should my dear dartagnan have been so but nature said no when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too	131.4216
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words	96.4960
my grandfather intends leaving this house said she and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another but you mademoiselle de villefortyou who are necessary to m	190.4801
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them	259.7819
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	74.8656
he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring	114.6332
yes my son and a sacred command say it my father the house of thomson french is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishnessit is not for me to read mens heartshas had any pity for me	105.5260
dartagnan saw that the moment was come	42.8843
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all dartagnan wished	144.3051
monsieur dartagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity	101.6381
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort	96.1601
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions	159.7630
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	74.3826
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon	73.7775
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	154.9882
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	194.7879
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	70.2585
de villefort	3.9719
remember your oath	384.4991
is it not a joke said danglars	45.0025
suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef	113.8357
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on	126.4339
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments	92.1316

cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethes heroes with varnished shoes and white silk openworked stockings passed a white and tolerably nicelooking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristos advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger	162.3027
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step	123.9018
on seeing him the regiment of corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered charenton flying	72.5570

ah if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits when we were at crevecoeur i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron	104.8458
the count de rochefort grimaud nodded the third time	123.1270
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio	214.2435
we have walked eight paces whispered dartagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery	194.6805
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his highnesss pieces of water i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds	182.5914
noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him	68.7926
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune	291.3121
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	264.6399
davrigny m	1032.4034
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him	82.7022
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silvermounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshals baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemys line of battle at fribourg	98.5104
madame de saintméran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m	76.6579

madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment	70.9067

adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan but i have never been presented presented to whom to the beautiful greek you say she is only a slave while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess	78.7410
what is the matter	5.6064
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose	206.4034
why thou art posted here by heaven no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses is aramis here yes sir he has been here since yesterday what are you doing on the watch what aramis here cried athos	131.4593
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me	80.7617
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered	99.1054
albert besides being an elegant welllooking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscounta recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris	206.7376
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with tears	138.6088
in august we lost francs at the beginning of the month but on the th we made up for it and we now find that our accounts reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday when i closed them showed a capital of francs that is for each of us	131.3920
he was a man between thirtynine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion	218.9163
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him	113.0528
he returned to france with the epaulet of sublieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in during the spanish warthat is to say at the time when danglars made his early speculations	68.4647
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	71.0103
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château dif dantès nevertheless determined to make for them	65.1084
she had many a time felt humiliated by the selfsacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman	393.9275
dartagnan looked at porthos	44.3391
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris	82.6460
zounds i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court	100.8309
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary	70.8663
de villefort said renée becoming quite pale dont you see how you are frightening usand yet you laugh what would you have	86.5803
milady is fair you say she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ah my poor dartagnan said athos	214.5293
she then thought that lord de winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer	148.2592
as they returned toward the castle dartagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not	148.3520
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	234.5214
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner have you a spanish prisoner cried the prince	205.4390
danglars in promoting a new railway line you m	967.6028
you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator	122.3932
porthos was discontented with his condition	110.4737
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project	92.5574
dartagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods	100.0689
in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to intimidate	85.3134
take care my young friend	55.6966
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical	93.1382
the womans lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered	146.2021
it must have been charming indeed	139.1507
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio	333.5758
no aramis replied	175.5405
tis true	214.4513
the night was extremely dark	200.3588
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness	24.9076
danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of banknotes	208.3379
you must make some reformation in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh	77.3910
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself	103.3274
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo	28.8764
no my lord and i will set out at once	33.9061
caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it	108.7889
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis chapter v	73.8626
my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you deep grief was depicted on morrels features he seized monte cristos hand	130.3938
he then began to ascend the path	71.7326
davrigny warned me of it	183.7670
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m	127.2068
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	92.0591
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy	58.7789
if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required a different alliance to aid his career if louis xviii	257.4337
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side	66.0819
wait for me here all of you cried m	86.3710
did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as a thing already decided indeed said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me why it seems m	129.0080
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society	156.8609
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlés or fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure worldling murmured the count	112.5048
de villefort bear it as usual	132.4314
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror	157.0507
so now i breathe againi am happy dont be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed dartagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering	206.7176
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m	105.6050
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto	212.5551
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellousthat which we do not understand	56.6560
after giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took alberts arm	115.3355
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	84.9225
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimneypiece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings	145.9626
but these francs here they are and more besides	310.9389
at precisely six oclock the clatter of horses hoofs was heard at the entrance door it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah	141.4668
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead	116.1005
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them	187.9242
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards	79.5768
take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris you are going to make a patriarch of him m oh no said morrel my sister is fiveandtwenty my brotherinlaw is thirty they are gay young and happy	101.9145
the notary looked at villefort	106.4974
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made	125.4294
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said dartagnan	83.0852
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m	78.3466
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m	65.9574
but we must not lose time	67.4983
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal the coadjutor started	86.5962
and aramis i have seen him also said dartagnan but he seemed to me cold ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on dartagnan a searching look	80.1048
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment	193.2404
very well said he	13.3968
he pushed through the crowd approached athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber	172.8253
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms	39.5676
whoever did it writes well	739.0784
i know what i wish to know follow me the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions	77.1066
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten oclock and the queen at what time is it her wish to start at midnight then it is possible	101.5757
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall	82.0108
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday	176.6744
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count it appears so sir replied monte cristo	83.7004
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic why so said danglars why dramatic can we account for instinct said monte cristo	187.4540
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possiblethat the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept	105.7069
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a bankerwith economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur demery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant	111.1819
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him	170.1202
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step	625.5442
meanwhile villefort and davrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	198.3965
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos	116.4874
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after	153.9947
planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side	49.2431
meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good	198.9446
as for me i can only repeat may god protect you and all dear to you sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin the host was at his door and everything was preparedbed bandages and lint and a groom had gone to lens the nearest village for a doctor	99.1457
with all my heart	58.4569
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her deathbed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel	141.0893
bring here immediately the kings attorney m	205.7845
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances	218.7659
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	197.7156
be philosophers as i am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us drink	89.1705
bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille	125.1113
where has he gone asked monsieur de cavois	79.7887
the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugénie	169.4811
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did	59.4262
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me no i thank you should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not i am not sure be twentyfour hours in prison without getting free my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly	167.1518
dartagnan monsieur well then athos porthos aramis and dartagnan forward cried athos	361.3063
the mind can see as well as the body	234.0637
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis	109.7562
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us all replied mordaunt	70.7997
albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him	121.3536
has such and such a perfume done anything for me	191.1949
otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at dartagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance	140.2241
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment	92.5488
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our placecry down with mazarin i will down with mazarin in french in good french my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly	152.4523
i was obliged to brand the guilty one and he gentlemen was my brother i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment	118.0891
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them	71.1069
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late the gale had given way	143.3904
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else	141.6935
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once	113.6124
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champsélysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel	156.3210
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day by bacchus rejoined mazarin impatiently its about an hour since i asked you for that very thing woodenhead that you are there is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out thats my concern i will make him speak ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they dont wish to let out pooh with patience one must succeed	113.2601
and what kind of a man a genuine englishman your eminence	154.4233
now said planchet let us bind him to a tree this being properly done they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day	100.8694
the nubian smiled assentingly to his masters words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count	77.1931
m	nan
ah _perbacco_ indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts raised in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated it would be fatal to his interests it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance _o peccato_ you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish	128.1039
your identity that is the misfortune you see i have not these necessary papers fortunately i have them though said monte cristo	109.0827
he went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road but gondy reflected for a moment and then said let him continue his journey all is not then over asked rochefort	94.8359
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors	90.8082
they are only four a joyous smile lighted porthoss face	342.8317
thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying hes too ugly m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed	135.6058
she had only one day left	225.0608
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	85.6781
besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him	98.6004
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed	174.5782
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed	85.5343
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide	106.0242
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also	99.5832
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it you ought to be satisfied if your majesty is so said tréville we are oh yes i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of dartagnan	57.4736
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age	110.7936
nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting paris as i told you as soon as possible	150.3338
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling	206.8221
davrigny	nan
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention	189.3224
stop i want to remember his exact words	157.5828
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf	58.8755
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain	63.3228
my father died but i did not die	46.0326
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow yes for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two then we shall not meet in paris i fear i shall not have that honor well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse	113.8285
let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes i am really he exmajor in the austrian service was i a major timidly asked the old soldier	117.0912
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away	118.0448
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these words carried a ray of hope into fernands heart	82.0080
the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill milady yes milady it is true you called her thus what has the monk to do with this milady she was his mother grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner	132.5684
what company company of tréville advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour the three companions advanced rather humblyfor all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselvesleaving athos the post of speaker	170.4134
did you see the postscript i did indeed	63.6883
a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the _barberi_	130.4272
are you on the ground asked dartagnan	37.1302
yes replied she trying to recover her selfpossession	114.6676
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in	68.3982
how sir she cried as dartagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crimeto give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me	104.6934
this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my life	89.2776
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house	134.3146
before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here ah try it milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony	366.2824
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words_wait and hope_your friend edmond dantès _count of monte cristo_ m during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks her happiness cost her very dear	150.4133
oh traitors that ye are sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman	82.2382
oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person	290.7912
yes very well	149.8146
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	93.7894
what refreshment can i offer	488.7738
do you wish to see her noirtier again made an affirmative sign	86.0371
was it the englishman who carried off crowns from here the other day m no he really had crowns and we found them	204.5249
we are so good and gentle to your eminence	55.4782
it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant	151.7590
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girls heart	88.9053
debray my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you	109.0987
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	306.2280
one question first	3461.6807
what he continued can i have been following a false pathcan the end which i proposed be a mistaken endcan one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking	181.5474
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day	125.0535
de villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded evil	160.4050
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time dartagnan was better informed than she was	126.2580
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de boisrobert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me i have no doubt of it said dartagnan	76.0000
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	119.1467

thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents	102.5173
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin thats all very well replied dartagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh	105.3920
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	342.6390
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered	96.8307
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers	83.3060
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation	183.5912
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers	97.9206
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended	130.5294
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven oclock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	137.9023
the old father and mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each others arms	157.7987
yes i am the executioner of lille and this is my history all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention	138.8808
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saintméran coffins	214.4239
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	75.5838
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him	74.1176
where did you place it	66.9342
andrea assumed his gayest manner	354.8545
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you withyou are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king	177.7987
and why so	323.5301
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit	131.6975
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void yes said villefort but i warn m	126.2628
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar	146.3326
de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king	72.5813
and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twentyseventh the name of porthos and at the thirtyfirst the name of aramis	119.4022
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack	136.7819
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid	204.0793
he is gone to noisy how dost thou know ah faith there was no great cunning necessary	324.8759
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger	136.1958
bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible	114.9359
faith yes	33.1652
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands	67.9243
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	129.0336
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	91.4924
they arrived at the appointed spot	52.7585
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly do not let that disturb you i have enough for two no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse good caderousse so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me true remorse and besides an idea had struck me andrea shuddered he always	121.0427
did so at caderousses ideas	1048.7655
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queens courtiers they are costumes of battle dartagnan and porthos obeyed	145.1252
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman i presume that she has returned to tours to tours	50.0537
caderousse rose	184.8979
i think so answered albert in a firm tone	49.0605
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de larbresec and two at the door of your palacefifteen in all	73.7456
a keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallowsbird	247.9465
listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park	57.7457
they advanced to the plain	83.0937
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrancegate and cast out on the doorsteps m	88.0897
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe	97.6549
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	108.0783
do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you watch everything hear everything interpret everything oh chevalier cried the king what can i say to you	206.3976
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinalhis physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur	62.0471
ah how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass youve not then forgotten me forget you oh dear du vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth ones dearest friends the dangers we have dared together	205.4290
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands	116.4208
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal	137.4830
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre	62.4509
and now said la ramee i must ask your highnesss pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimauds eyes	72.9933
come continued athos executioner do your duty willingly monseigneur said the executioner for as i am a good catholic i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman thats well athos made a step toward milady	155.8900
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance	168.8919
franz dépinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfishyou have already said soand as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself	115.2949
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	80.0985
yes monsieur a most excellent sister married nearly nine years happy asked the count again	298.4186
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and dartagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss	123.4737
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already due	281.7817
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow	122.9313
no where i can confess but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul	83.9558
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker	64.1341
all falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face	176.8305
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hours gallop and one fell down	230.7666
de morcerf	12.8892
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the counts room and in ten minutes all will be settled mazarin started	72.8984
look i shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us but supposing he doesnt mount he will rely upon it	89.0141
in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria who was in her oratory with the young king louis xiv to receive the cardinal	137.5479
grimaud rose and obeyed	90.2895
and his name said he	54.2417
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung and on what account i rescued from the hands of mazarins police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years will you name him oh you know him well my lordit is count de rochefort ah really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned	99.5977
there they are	133.0705
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	37.8335
then what asked monte cristo	30.3813
what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me	69.7913
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the queen what i make the first advances said the king	62.5185
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now oh monsieur chevalier do you love that woman still no no it is one of my friends who loves hermonsieur athos this gentleman here i cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder	93.3820
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin	120.7666
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	36.0563
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses	62.0401
he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man	191.7283
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed	164.9225
really honest men are not so scarce as i thought dont be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman	130.3328
m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtiers room	91.8192
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	169.0176
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner colonel tomlison said charles kings cannot yield the man alone submits to force your sword the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee	144.7056
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager princess	70.0482
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	44.3888
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	102.6306
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine	72.5825
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance	222.3096
you prohibited my mentioning my fathers name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖνthat is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow	120.9690
the wounds that i make are better than thatwitness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles	298.1493
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address	57.2665
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you you know what i have done i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	74.3821
tomorrow morning i start for paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent	97.3726
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest	248.8735
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	154.2346
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto athos and aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety	81.7808
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose	74.0711
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you sufferyou maximilian whom i love as my own son	163.3860
héloïse de villefort	66.1802
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe	154.8073
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him and are there no cardinals that can fight	109.6000
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo	28.7071
we must then as it appears to me travel in company	178.6644
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news alas sire answered athos your majesty has guessed aright it is bad news yes sire never mind the messenger is welcome	162.5443
but would you ruin me if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guardhouse besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear	122.0102
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him	88.2427
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am he said to himself	65.5550
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains	181.2080
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent	142.2818
he would not however yield immediately to the young mans request but made a few conscientious objections	171.5627
morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at halfpast six	591.8838
by degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course	262.6826
he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackneycoach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband	96.4075
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	53.7352
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for	144.3907
and you really understand none of these signals none at all and have you never tried to understand them never	145.8021
de tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress	103.0259
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	112.1793
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle oh heavens cried athos	213.2806
when they were within ten paces of him dartagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them	131.9307
dépinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart	79.0676
well i was a million in advance with him and now my fine jacopo manfredi suspends payment really it is an unheardof fatality	215.7966
dartagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la rochelle how do you know that my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers	57.4389
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh	27.7763
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him	99.9392
it is my wish that she should marry m	92.2381
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth	86.0270
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the popes decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal	128.1059
when shall we land in england he asked but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply	144.2022
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine	178.2198
le baron franz dépinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders	80.1260
de villeforts handsthen i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis	106.9788
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat	82.8150
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneat least so it is saidand i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeatit is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions	175.2023
listen he said today is the th of september is it not yes today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay yes we know that well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house what will happen then why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a bankrupt oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	84.6370
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	76.6897
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which dartagnan bowed as a sign that he listened	55.8747
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel	666.1929
at this moment villefort returned	68.7226
there we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter but eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow	165.7168
when i was at rogliano everything went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became master and everything went ill	410.6514
the _mêlée_ became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers	110.0729
the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	194.6523
dartagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception	106.7007
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight	157.3316
i have always found them and morei repeat it with joy with triumphi have always found some proof of human perversity or error	128.3117
and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie	292.9628
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself	863.6384
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo	28.7991
m	nan
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy	634.7592
how convenient that theres a bench here	685.3428
silence child hush we are flying i did not understand	237.3539
on the staircase he met signor pastrini	100.0840
dartagnan made his way through the crowd advanced toward the host and pronounced the word forward the host instantly made him a sign to follow went out with him by a door which opened into a yard led him to the stable where a saddled horse awaited him and asked him if he stood in need of anything else	82.7585
de morcerf into the drawingroom said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase	127.9128
it was nearly eight oclock when they set out again	66.8727
well dantès you do not thank me this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only	54.1067
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told meit was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy	198.3091
villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is removed had m	147.8532
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day	94.8305
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman	219.2806
i have answered for you	51.1931
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them	104.1386
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles yes and remember that twolegged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others never mind let us go on with all my heart you tell me he burned the letter he did saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural you think so i am sure of it	110.6178
nothing replied maximilian	152.8028
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets	83.3354
imitate me	15.4096
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak	34.1198
pardieu pass replied dartagnan	310.9227
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men	114.2329
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion	269.9623
yes a telegraph	386.1924
alexander vi	2100.2981
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	130.2644
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects	103.0477
escape my lordescape your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is yes i do sir in the donjon of vincennes yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watchspring one may saw through an iron bar then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission no no cried mazarin fearing	161.3352
that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement	204.1245
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls	172.0378
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue	139.1413
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land	160.6531
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests	115.9779
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst dartagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left	32.6415
dartagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed	179.6127
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows	333.7789
baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance	66.7724
there is one comfort we are all in cash said dartagnan	83.0697
we therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul certainly sir replied the viscount	285.6197
danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end am i indeed so happy said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow	198.7472
but i say no more madame it is really as if i were prescribing for you the clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her	67.2788
for gods sake tell me did you know this englishman but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service yes then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation everything is possible in this affair even a miracle what was his name asked monte cristo	110.9032
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule	223.5939
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	440.7724
this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume	78.0389
he was charming	148.4313
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him you prefer then said the abbé that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship that is true enough returned caderousse	150.4002
on reaching home dartagnan found kitty waiting for him	137.9605
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks	222.0947
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	45.8791
the investigation would begin at eight oclock that evening in the committeeroom and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour	103.8664
i come from the cardinal said the officer	42.9011
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed	131.1522
de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champsélysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressingroom	80.9101
you seek me sir said he	75.8559
come now he said	36.5572
franz dépinay observed valentine	391.5276
i as a tender father and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you whom do you mean by they _ma foi_ i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not yes from whom from a certain abbé busoni have you any knowledge of him no i have never seen him what did he say in the letter you will promise not to betray me rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans hand	115.0119
which route must i take demanded dartagnan in his turn	153.3785
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jackinthebox	159.5998
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos	53.8334
haydée had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier	212.5967
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal	164.7025
shall i give you the change my officer said the host	53.0591
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones	236.1268
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majestys wishes charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	210.8011
mme	nan
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was all	71.4833
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo reentered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan	153.0816
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man	74.4415
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	107.1641
what to dinner said dartagnan	117.3153
suddenly dartagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before	123.2746
the breakfast chapter	175.4766
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo	206.8548
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell	44.7109
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman	53.7856
have no more concern about me i exist no longer for you any more than if you had never seen me must aramis do as much as i madame said dartagnan deeply piqued	118.6462
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am dartagnan dont you know me	54.4462
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible	136.3226
stand aside he cried stand off the road what do you want asked a voice	129.9625
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner	70.2672
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said	118.0688
m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	105.6822
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased	129.3598
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majestys ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor dartagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues	130.3962
from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier	75.5125
this time said athos first breaking the silence dartagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once the devil you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	92.2747
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon	72.5061
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	106.4664
you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject	82.6254
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind	84.2770
you see mercédès said the young man here is easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again well repeat itrepeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mothers sanction	94.8262
de villefort chapter	37.4860
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus	55.5478
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	99.0497
nevertheless you come as one in authority because i happened to be in the antechamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance	99.1562
morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind	122.5867
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man	276.0283
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman	130.2513
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of bordeaux	148.3129
he took the child in his arms embraced him shook him called him but the child made no response	113.4129
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged usthe comte de la fere and monsieur du vallonto accompany him	81.5491
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuilthe terror of all expert palates	191.0907
the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no in the rue meslay	140.7430
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	48.8198
the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts	95.1893
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself	92.8803
it is very simple mousqueton had said he is thinking of groslow it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parrys head	175.9458
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawingroom	149.6447
i have placed reliance upon you my friend	92.1609
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	122.9149
the outlook was sad	539.6742
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family	55.3647
i am lost said dartagnan to himself	34.5205
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château dif and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery	117.9024
how many people thought he and not one true friend and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart	172.8172
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count	98.8929
a little better sir will you drink some of this ether and water i will try but dont touch me why not because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return drink barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him	129.8045
sir said dartagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	78.2658
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo	58.1222
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you	58.2054
dartagnan dressed himself and athos did the same	86.9277
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity	165.1308
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up	170.7037
the memory of richelieu annihilates me	127.6332
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne	1013.1661
capital answered the mendicant	93.3797
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms	71.7347
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	39.2432
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty	102.4206
let us to bed and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by dartagnan	71.9747
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches	177.9757
m why should he doubt it said beauchamp to châteaurenaud	144.4709
today is the th of june yes well renew these bills up to the th of september and on the th of september at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money i shall expect you returned morrel and i will pay youor i shall be dead these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them	77.7420
mazarin again	614.8868
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the stewards extraordinary repugnance for the counts projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey	164.3393
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing	109.7060
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them	94.7909
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles	214.0797
thou hast done well returned the old man in a hoarse voice embrace me my son m carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistresss father	113.0357
yes i understand said valentine it is because you love me the old man assented	46.3507
the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the counts possession	121.9668
on the entrance of the newcomers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising	272.4831
chapter xc	99.8055
have you seen him i left him five days ago said dartagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston	120.3669
ah cried blaisois he is lost grimauds a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton	302.1618
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother	196.2522
de morcerf with all my heart returned albert italian cigars are horrible	307.9286
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another	211.9217
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged	192.6986
when do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to caderousse	64.7744
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world	59.9375
that pretty little _soubrette_ whom dartagnan had already observed then came in	234.9054
you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered but but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs	125.4202
first one gunl goes under then the other	234.5299
lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle	146.8025
in the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg and future generations	70.5915
and what brought you here i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort	179.7251
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you i pledge you my word madam said the abbé that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly ah thats all very fine retorted the woman	138.6145
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder yes certainly well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire	263.7857
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions	114.2681
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven	145.0138
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello	87.1657
chapter xlvii	88.7212
she saw davrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night	207.2765
poor king culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes	246.4174
enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death	420.9031
she listened at eugénies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place	155.3109
and now once more adieu said morrel	188.1744
milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips she had to deal with a gascon who played close	140.5425
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me	212.7845
and yet here are two culprits yes but only one of these two is about to die the other has many years to live if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose and see here it is said the count	78.8358
yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten	105.0822
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison	132.7085
besides let me own something to you	159.7423
chance is so capricious	117.6995
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	58.3464
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	109.3872
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage	111.4434
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible but instead of listening m	72.4034
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself	93.3602
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty	245.0719
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	74.3263
his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbé faria had been	161.6500
it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock	83.0300
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors	198.4208
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak	81.9663
tréville added the king in a low voice as the others were retiring as you have no room in the musketeers and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart your brotherinlaw	86.2905
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilios wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen	307.4963
whywhat do you mean by that question i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these	70.7159
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine	184.9272
dartagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	116.9816
but be assured my dear monsieur dartagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself oh i dont doubt that replied dartagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of armsa certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities	81.1721
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house	136.9783
behold madame here are the august signatures of your majestys hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them and dartagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in annes hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty	95.2088
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural _ma foi_ said châteaurenaud i would rather end my career like m	230.9529
on leaving the paternal chamber the young man found his mother who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment	91.4410
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa	55.1987
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed	99.9432
the two things agree marvelously well i am all attention said dartagnan	171.2145
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house	105.9942
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound	263.4406
review your life albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summers day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career	274.5043
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerfs apartments	217.3673
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no then you did not bury the poor child there sir	81.2691
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not	71.9545
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	196.6968
_peste_ edmond you have a very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile	69.2055
de saintmérans	299.8409
it is the talk of all paris and you count have made this match asked beauchamp	102.0677
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner	201.7305
fortunately he fancied that dantès was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew	93.6610
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	187.7881
he gave us some very fine horses and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own	138.6325
these cannot be for us said athos	82.1654
in addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the order of the holy ghost and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the order of the king was his ancestor	105.0124
athos exclaimed dartagnan	81.9941
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	69.8456
you are safeyou are free mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle	92.2106
how will you prove continued the jesuit without allowing him time to speak that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to god	90.0384
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a postchaise is an event	206.7963
i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the sorti suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing	129.7156
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs play	139.1948
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek	158.3049
de monte cristo you must demand an explanation yes and we are going to his house reflect morcerf one moment before you go on what shall i reflect on the importance of the step you are taking is it more serious than going to m	141.2172
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another	92.2665
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew	102.2583
while he was doing this dartagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared	146.3012
milady recognized his step	162.8560
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened	62.9923
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere	41.0601
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast	78.8485
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do well it is true said anne of austria and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully	51.9172
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbés meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies	118.7150
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of it shall be done replied bertuccio	56.5344
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard	88.8181
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures	208.2944
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary i said the queen	136.4463
there remains the valise added porthos	385.3410
speak that your eminence will go at once to the queen what for merely to say these words i am going to send monsieur dartagnan away and i wish him to set out directly i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake what is the meaning of that may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence very well i will go	51.0237
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act	49.6157
the scheme goes forward it seems on wheels dear friend good what shall i do now nothing it is finished then no not yet i should like to understand said porthos	170.4797
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	83.6976
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast	88.4896
what will our two friends say	105.7132
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres good god cried she two thousand livres why that is a fortune porthos made a most significant grimace mme	111.0753
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	216.9329
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table	77.8809
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down	218.7219
planchet stopped short staring at dartagnan	521.8835
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet	316.7734
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain	111.8326

he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	180.9678
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it	135.6007
no you sounded me nothing more	663.3846

my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs	81.2356
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at you at me yes albert reflected	233.3017
how	nan
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	84.4417
see i have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves	141.3489
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	279.4639
parliament indeed cried athos	66.8864
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem	263.2738
why for him and not for me	94.3357
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day	47.2588
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening	113.1817
help help cried the abbé iidiei m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket	174.1599
the chocolate was inoffensive for m	221.8740
you wish to see blois again it is but natural then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed raoul joyously	82.7265
perhaps so	266.6390
let it come said athos	42.0140
de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letterdonned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to no in the avenue des champsélysées	183.4995
but with his simple musketeers uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank	133.0931
ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise darmilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine	145.7930
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where dartagnan was waiting	65.2423
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and dartagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m	94.8482
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	36.3010
it was now nine oclock	71.4908
this was neither long nor difficult	522.0386
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure	220.0978
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut i wish we were already there said dartagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five oclock in the morning	122.5063

this way this way constance	1875.0439
morrel to come and claim me at my own hands	68.9935
but to her great surprise dartagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah so much the better to that exclamation of porthoss succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door	149.1641
it was the count de rochefort	39.1365
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	121.2147
by the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying fire	57.0655

the you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand	180.8290
bernouin introduced him	114.4750
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily	102.1693
he clung to one ideathat of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheardof fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante	182.5586
for women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me	290.5218
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind	77.5906
why of downright starvation starvation exclaimed the abbé springing from his seat	223.9340
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented	77.9107

i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend	238.9946
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration	80.3542
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinala change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution	71.3133
a man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones	233.6428
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after alberts departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy	249.5065
what is it asked mazarin	27.6091
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future	114.3451
little flirtations perhaps and thats all	278.7281

m when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars	84.2901

which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soulthe last trace of youth and happiness that had survived lifes disillusions	117.2376
follow you cried bonacieux follow you at this hour where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance	100.2206
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said tréville	121.9856
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot	75.1333

the day on which dartagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province	288.1381
adieu thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him	78.1400
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant	113.6762
out of the hundred and sixtythree members designated there were only seventythree present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away	201.6664

danglars fancied that they had reached the longdesired point he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows	92.5474
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause	433.4921
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom	361.0315

in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada familyviz a sword _en pale_ on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinals hat	168.2604
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched	115.8389

valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help	138.8884

what is the matter maximilian asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead morrel fell into a chair	66.0266
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god	200.4077
of course said he of what else should i speak mr inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are liberated the abbés eyes glistened he seized the inspectors hand	133.5101
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared	81.9806
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain	199.6522
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking	200.4928

his shoulderknots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron	132.4344
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word	47.0798
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	115.5083
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frockcoat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travellingcap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes	112.4942

and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me if my society would not be disagreeable be it so	123.3646
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure	81.7418
allow me then sire to intercede for her with your majesty let her humble herself then and come to me first on the contrary sire set the example	124.0369

as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety	99.8740

bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	65.8246

still silent valentine had promised not to wake	308.7562
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful	131.6795

the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance	126.1397
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer	53.9956
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind	75.7966
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	133.8695
we want money for our return to paris i am much attached to that horse athos and there again you are wrong	99.0598
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain the hostess who knew dartagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair	99.9288
then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all	216.1709
i have promised you the truth i will tell it were it to destroy me the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried felton	74.9423
does your excellency wish me to accompany him no the coachman ali and baptistin will go the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars	65.9017
this was their mutual declaration of love	118.3123
today its a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask planchet mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of dartagnan	148.5477
go valentine said madame de saintméran and leave me with this gentleman but grandmamma leave mego the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the diningroom	58.9966

do you know what has become of athos asked dartagnan of planchet as they galloped on	57.8065
in fact a moment later m	55.8735
we must play the farce to the end	50.7155
we are going to execute your wishes may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe	79.9588
athos cried the two musketeers	40.2967
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although i am only your brotherinlaw i will arrange one similar my first husband cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets	135.4748

but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	165.3901

in his eyes and to his conviction mme	139.3911
that knife was for you my lad she would have killed you	126.1400
dartagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung	145.0001
at ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented	103.8278
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m	114.1565
ah locked he exclaimed these devils of english how suspicious they are locked said blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset locked repeated mousqueton	482.5909
gramercy who would ever have thought it dartagnan only sighed	165.7537
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	119.9286
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham	76.3734
at last their hilarity calmed down and faith exclaimed dartagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin for i assure you on his side he wishes you no good pooh really asked athos	135.4055
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so and what does it amount to after all	95.6655
he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a spada but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise	198.9739
we are invited replied dartagnan to pass the night with m	90.1121
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of louis xviii who retreated a step and frowned	83.2247
ho musketeers cried dartagnan	176.2886
chapter lxxii	94.8258
and monsieur dartagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur dherblay may i ask if you have any news of him we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us no sir i am sure he hasnt yet arrived	101.2832
and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant	86.2667
at this order given in athoss habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthoss brow grew smooth	211.5488
de tréville looking at the clock why thats impossible look rather monsieur said dartagnan the clock shows it thats true said m	162.2412
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the gascons blade terrified them	117.5396
de tréville	3.8105
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this muchdesired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti	91.9322
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness	72.4904
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen	143.5876
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles	81.7826
the th of february at halfpast two in the afternoon today is the th of july why it is but seventeen months only seventeen months replied dantès	107.7893
i thought you were at smyrnai was but am now back again and where is the dear boy our little edmond why with his father no doubt replied danglars	169.2936
nobody serves me for nothing	199.3449
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice	102.1548
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	87.5956
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	80.7470
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule	151.1116
this knife was my only hope	289.1125
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed	197.9666

this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted	48.7969
are you mad uncle he called me by this name when he was in good humor do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum	179.4794
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago when are you to pay half the th of this month half the th of next just so and now here are francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders i recognize them said morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature	120.9180
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke	166.8400
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity	310.2295
the young man read valentines letter twenty times in the course of the day	55.6742
morcerf repeated debray	303.8628
what a question now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied châteaurenaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile	86.7418
cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in	133.7052
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme	182.7014
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore	72.1848
i should not have guessed it	38.2410
it was about five oclock	50.9372
if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistakenmaximilian started as if he had been electrified	82.5075
row said he to the sailors	42.6615
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters arrest	64.5083
courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the queen to her and to you cried dartagnan	94.5974
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar	103.0520
what hinders it exclaimed the king	97.6635
he likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	97.7090
aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the rest measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion i resolved to set out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the unity of the italian kingdom but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me and my	140.9499
hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino	106.4069
yes said noirtier	79.7471
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines and planchet dined by sleeping	191.7407
not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes	100.4724
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort	87.2294
but this year continued the horticulturist ill take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe monte cristo had seen enough	124.5379
in the name of heaven cried he listen to me i have been waiting for someone who has not come	34.3681
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	60.6381
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	112.9941
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow	204.3428
but you say you do not wish to kill me no and yet you will let me perish with hunger ah that is a different thing well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculationsi would rather die at once you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again as your excellency pleases said vampa as he left the cell	95.5719

de trévilles office	140.4488
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by dartagnan	182.0153
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes	168.2324
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven oclock we will then terminate this conversation	107.2459
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women	83.1561
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered	304.1576
oh if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardonable the procurators wife was piqued	97.1424
alas no said mme	77.5109

do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed	140.7289
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house	54.7429
albert listened with the most profound attention	93.4697
dartagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	132.4290
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven	154.2830
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	167.0632
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	93.0756
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted	128.0621
de boville the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome presented himself at m	48.0160

i asked the price they told me it was francs	119.0171
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door	136.7663
cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal dukeall things which appeared to dartagnan monstrous impossibilities	254.5071
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them	88.7118
the lackeys followed	313.3226
these leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it they adopted as a maximfor they too had maximsthat it was of very little consequence that women children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy	183.8121
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	98.4218
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund	51.1416
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed	196.0339
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès	191.2348
what are you meddling with stupid	82.6781
so they made this song about her _laboissiere dis moi_ you know it dont you no sing it please aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner	219.6831
de tréville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip	84.6740
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistolshots	51.2728
a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it	310.5566
they proposed a game of _bouillotte_	187.7231
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he	96.9824

make way for us planchet said dartagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass they are friends the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again	108.1586

gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings dartagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos	180.3458
the three musketeers possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about dartagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from dartagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent	119.6038

you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge	157.7600
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinals decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only the deputies bowed and left the room	128.2592
dartagnan alone did not seem convinced	236.7690
there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as i told you i expect someone at nine	124.6019

on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him	124.1209
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from illluck or from some natural defect or impediment remain halfway upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations	164.0803
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort	89.5049

while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to alberts while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard	168.9005

an instant after they were on the deck	58.3095
during this time porthos played close	166.6718
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise a hundred louis well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something	88.4646

ah confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust	198.3307
mazarin leaned out of the window	32.3599
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven thirtyfive minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	131.7173

after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	98.7466
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	140.9613

in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creaturefrom the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guardsfrom that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firinglet off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms	159.6838

morcerfs courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow	208.3737

if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur yes seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tréville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn without doubt and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes you have already given me that reason and i find it excellent reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you	127.8229
about rent very kind and adding to this if there be need of it meaning to offer you fifty pistoles if against all probability you should be short at the present moment admirable you are rich then my dear monsieur bonacieux i am comfortably off monsieur thats all i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator jean moquet so that you understand monsieurbut cried the citizen	154.1236

thats another matter	339.6398
i know him well there and what did the officers do four conveyed him away i dont know whereto the bastille or fort levêque	235.2532
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource	196.3560
i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics	119.0469
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again never see you again exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julies cheeks never behold you again	171.8526

milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid	63.3674
dartagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into dartagnans breast crying one for you and one for methe best for last cried dartagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body	98.7518
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night	35.1298
well sir exclaimed mazarin whats the matter	66.2081
dartagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side	136.2812
we shall be carried in triumph in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion	101.4891
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart	95.6015
morrel and mercédès came to see him but his door was closed and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer	50.9660

yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired	97.6402
i will say then _monsieur_ quite short you may even say _my lord_ replied athos who stickled for propriety	294.2709
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more	345.4010
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos	55.0931
back people cried dartagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business here indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall	137.9046
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter	116.9596
oh do not deny it answer continued milady	122.5870
still as five oclock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner	116.0236
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested dartagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon	117.1608
valentine	nan
cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	90.4756

you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired	67.5682
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter	132.4703
comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du trahoir but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace with stones and halberds the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house	82.6004
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	309.0990
mademoiselle darmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the germans are so fond	111.8973
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet him the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses	81.2991
besides were not those riches chimericaloffspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him	109.3299
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winters athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raouls account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle	83.4373
this evening m	74.2353
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	481.2284
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to falluntil at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer	199.9658
it was simply yet richly furnished	798.6284
he is a coward with women perhaps but not with men	173.6509
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england	64.5997
let us get ready gentlemen but this second letter said athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened	98.4058
i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity	74.2604
dartagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron	117.5128
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	123.3735
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat	143.9976
the striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows	123.1692
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest	207.3307
look said the boy theres our beadle who is going a journey and where is he going asked dartagnan	107.7562

from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter	350.2983
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met dartagnan who having seen all was coming to him	114.4057
it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i cannot take off my doublet for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed again and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself that is true monsieur replied dartagnan and whether drawn by myself or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman	104.1006
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so	77.5178
where was i then	57.2652
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her you are right said dartagnan i will have done with her	48.7021
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	115.7740
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit	74.2209
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness	48.6021

with regard to dartagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet	120.3170
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the postingmaster	46.3224
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel	144.5817
you can restore it to his family said dartagnan	54.5843
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step	86.5994
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquiredehmy friend aramis paused	111.0962
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute	76.0704

we shall know sir replied the president	49.0124
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead	101.4208
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothingwithout reckoning mousquetons wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with dartagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short said	143.8402

de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin	54.1761

danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sittingroom where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness	155.0665

i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see the two friends saluted the duke	86.6542
but nothing escaped the counts notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the ministers secretary	143.2868
de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two yearsa novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for dartagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action	225.7986

ah your pardon said albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampas torch	156.8828
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my bloodstained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte	187.8755
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope hope repeated danglars	138.2940

and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens	240.8589
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos	66.5128
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him	38.4711

then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemeni was afraid you were dangerously ill the two men in black who guessed dartagnans meaning darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening but dartagnan took no heed of it	176.3371

in the kings service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms	124.7842
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel dartagnan began to recover himself little by little	207.5332
let us get down count and examine this rock they both alighted	222.9611

how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything how ought she really to be supremely loved she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently	143.7654

we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us	130.9948
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	136.3871

bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by dartagnan and porthos	74.1055
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community	159.6181
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance	121.6943
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection	225.3079
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men i have measured them	136.2565
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefortobserve that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefortvillefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the soninlaw of the marquis and marquise de saintméran	100.9679

mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	66.0704
i am incredulous the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal	93.6190

himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear	70.1758
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	76.4352
what have i done then	73.3494
no listen to me i have the true idea let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young musketeer	90.8386

tis he it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness	93.4181
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of dartagnan	75.4942
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses	152.8920
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely reechoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	147.0232

but how is it he is not already returned	56.5763
barrois said she	32.4636
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences valentine seized the counts hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips	88.1645
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edwards room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor	113.1325
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women	112.7688
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me the executioner of lille the executioner of lille cried milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling	72.2425

she will soon pass she is already late	281.1296
you are ungrateful dartagnan said athos yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner	152.7773
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to dartagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said sir jump directly down close to monsieur de la fere or on the honor of a gentleman ill kill you monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me idid i promise you anything my lord mazarin groaned	96.2758
what do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone	91.7775
he was occupied with the preparations for raouls departure and was seeking to gain time	80.3459
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much	150.2860
dartagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder	80.4375
where is the key you speak of here it is ah my lord you will conduct us yourself then to that door very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door	84.4219
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	82.7884
which i received this morning dartagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it	59.7743
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	95.9609
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not	23.5608
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement	110.5561

at last as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and monte cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit	53.1477
dartagnan dartagnan cried mme	356.4876

into the servicethe kings service mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at dartagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost choked	114.4327
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin	113.1672
you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since i came here	116.3921

father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a halfopen door from which he could see the whole of a small room	99.3475

at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a childs caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mothers voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given	181.5992

that is true said dartagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis	58.3092

signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	165.7575
my mother thought me dead she is not guilty	135.7515
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt it is for that reason you see me so early because you have the order of charles iii and you wish to announce the good news to me no because i passed the night writing lettersfiveandtwenty despatches	117.6813
this immediately recalled to dartagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme	86.2937
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert albert understood his thoughts	151.3750

andrea cavalcanti to m	170.8969
but tell me what do you ask nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something the procurators wife hung upon the arm of porthos and in the violence of her grief she cried out monsieur porthos i am ignorant of all such matters how should i know what a horse is	65.2836
my fault said he you must be mad what do i know of the grecian affair	57.5725

i confess this staggers me and it has staggered everybody	569.8973
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage	160.0388
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo	123.7816
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad augury	227.1294
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	41.2211
but they are calling me	95.9104

i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin	110.3932

really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with manthat is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really donotunderstand youperfectly i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those officeholders whose commissions have been signed by	140.7036
a minister or king and that the men whom god has put above those officeholders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to filli say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation	248.2153
yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude in that case it would be quite another thing	139.3198

as to dartagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his face	82.5018
he touched him on the shoulder	47.6829
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty	137.4703
as he had twenty times touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	179.4640

your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	123.3741
it was then that dartagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it	82.8574
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle	124.7276

duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes	47.5522
it has four hundred lines and lasts a minute my faith my dear aramis said dartagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits you will see continued aramis that it breathes irreproachable passion	132.4002
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i resisted	161.0215
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès	194.2525
what was it then	37.4462
proceed sire i beg	125.9290

the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination	181.0777
it is not courage that is needed it is prudence and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave dartagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos	93.9367
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly	120.7141
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	140.2939
it is six oclock said madame de villefort evidently agitated	80.8684
to save a man to spare a fathers feelings or a mothers sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them	98.4355

at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after	82.6698

one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp	95.4203
poor dear man he is innocence itself and something like a faint smile lighted the stillterrified features of the young woman	110.4156
i know nothing	46.5904
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together impossible said dartagnan we are under mazarins orders i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like dartagnan and porthos	191.5928
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection never to anyone you understand me replied villefort affectionately when i say anyonepardon my urgencyto anyone living i mean yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness never i swear to you were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning	114.8442

bertuccio lay covers for three he then took franzs tablets out of his hand	290.7018

as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness youre a great moralist and thats the fact said porthos	184.2573
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered	100.7604
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat	72.2561
the four or five remaining hours before nine oclock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visitsdesigned to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the bankers in their gayest equipagesdazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative	239.7807
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility	215.3298
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment	113.8794
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address	42.7441
porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing pierrefonds and added that name to his others	150.9814
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor	83.1782
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuels hand significantly watch over him why so asked the young man surprised	113.5020

the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess	347.8168
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	174.6410
m good said caderousse	108.7803
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	123.4768
well asked he	46.6184
our readers already know how he was recognized by dartagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey	186.1295
ah dartagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable dartagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis	99.3604
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might	201.6294
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy	117.2810
de boville receivergeneral of the charities _ma foi_ said monte cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out	92.3412
de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms	84.7076

aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash	153.2048
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron	61.0383
it was delightful weather	1674.9525
while doing so he observed m	576.0791

you ought i say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman	190.6369
ah it is you tréville	110.3456
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that halfsmile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face	105.9810
the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided	345.5699

and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief	106.2094
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	100.0453
it signifies nothing whether you eat much or littlewhether you have ten dishes or oneit is always the same price what still keeping up this silly jest	282.8770
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpentlike embraces	187.0383
_holà_ aramis what the devil are you doing there cried the two friends	47.2922
dartagnan and athos took the nags of planchet and grimaud and the two lackeys started on foot carrying the saddles on their heads	95.1872
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg	114.6080
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for dartagnan and an ace for himself	128.9261
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering	81.3664
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	107.1965

we have so many worlds in the year of grace in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue come come that is not bad said lucien	103.5899
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest	87.8060
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade	63.6135
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m	128.6374
your dartagnan	2358.5525
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	37.3633
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper	114.2811
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	259.6752
cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us	284.0384

milady saw the trouble	87.6995
no counti hopei assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort	134.9100
he called it using his advantages	460.6339
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti	258.2165
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	143.3684
the two brigands looked at each other for a momentthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow	49.4624
he retired to his toilet	114.5921
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and dartagnan turned to him	47.0205
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	61.6590
we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people	69.9697
the three friendsfor as we have said athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himselfwent out early in the morning and returned late at night	125.0035
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex	262.7366
then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer but what are your intentions mercédès smiled sadly	213.7967
come said dartagnan let us go and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration	117.1906

and madame de villefort cried baptistin	51.4919
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling	195.2671
the fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen	96.0144
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news said he	146.0043
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box	83.8782
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance dartagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london	90.1409
i pass my life upon my legs aramis again presented himself at the bishops	145.2850
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends	98.5664
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine with a heavy heart dartagnan again bent his way toward the ferry	123.7919
and my only heir are you not said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady	50.7160
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance	222.4001
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor	189.5151

then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees	109.1990
i have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses	43.4164
come caderousse no nonsense said he	232.1348
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame	187.6434
your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits what cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance no for it would be useless	133.7612
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet	198.2009
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant	283.9080
i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor well then if you did depend upon it fernand picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it	114.2113
madame de saintmérans last request was that the marriage might not be delayed must i let things take their course noirtier did not move	168.3324
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request noirtier made a sign that they did	66.4557

come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine come i feel ill here and the two young men spurred on	103.0563
aramis at this movement drew his sword	101.3341

as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir	158.7020
open the door cried villefort	56.8836
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	112.8606
dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one	75.6793
dispose of me then as a friend but iwhere shall i go meanwhile is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you no i can trust nobody stop said dartagnan we are near athoss door	170.1325
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	106.2686
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	174.8272
that voice also was known to grimaud	309.0996
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray	130.6363
they all four entered the tent they had no plan readythey must think of one	265.1832
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door	74.5703
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down	183.4360
the people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves	153.0730
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him	157.9268
cries of down with mazarin death to the cardinal resounded on all sides	232.7099

m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display	169.9335

on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation	97.6606
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of planchet faded away	143.0358
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared	121.6803

in the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget that	90.7145
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe	69.6972
on that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation	112.0779

bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired	90.2203
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered	139.3104
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	273.3451
thus for instance the excellent abbé adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments really yes i will mention one to you	158.5989

morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes	143.9358
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	92.5780
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement	104.9565
go away now mouston so hes called mouston thought dartagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	311.2154

at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of portovecchio	58.9283
this method was so simple that dartagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively	229.8375
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly	236.8776
let our readers reassure themselves	848.5195
the pates were excellent the wine delicious	838.0059
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawingroom where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs	241.5728
besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal look at that wallwithout a single windowwhich tells you fine things about mazarins gratitude yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur dartagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him poor dartagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves	123.9210

all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	155.1395
thou must add said dartagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servantman with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	97.5669

come gentlemen your swords said the duke	73.1948
milady was all attention	219.3244
porthos who could never see anything that was not selfevident talked to him as usual	72.8714
bonacieux and then when bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city	123.8645
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind	88.8399
then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_ patrick	185.0825
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	82.4530
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton	98.8986

repeat it repeat it cried dartagnan it will make a little change not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse the devil said dartagnan	86.1615
he had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone	54.5139
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form	105.3612
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	71.5084
yes but your father died in your arms happy respected rich and full of years his father died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards his tomb had disappeared and no one could say there sleeps the father you so well loved oh exclaimed morrel	309.9440
dartagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	162.5531
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	139.3784
most undoubtedly said planchet	255.5474
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning	210.8484
what for	562.9025
good quite right cried mordaunt springing off his horse	191.5504
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead	183.5746
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then halfcarrying halfsupporting him he managed to reach the abbés chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed	147.7095
another and a magnificent one cried the host	114.9621
de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death	32.2622
i want to go into master broussels house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary	239.3849

noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair	115.9486
come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter	24.1631
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path	113.9272
order was reestablished in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another	151.3783
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	158.9995
dartagnan and the englishman dartagnan followed milady without being perceived by her	112.4593
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you why i think there were not many intruders	102.7530
ah cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression ah i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away	127.5463
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	144.8887
it was a dull foggy night	71.5230
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man	107.9645
the two ladies entered the drawingroom with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	138.0525
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	104.8272
the devil take the madman murmured m	277.6941
he approached her	63.2368
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated	106.4971
well resumed mme	361.2779
a few seconds afterward dartagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which illconcealed the sheath of a long sword	78.0200
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded	149.8434
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open dartagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid	137.8498
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	35.0098
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me	52.7628
dartagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had notwhatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subjectbeen able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence	172.4397
well read it he demands your head m my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two men	126.2147
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy	115.9397
