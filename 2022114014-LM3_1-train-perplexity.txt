wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the queen how long did the queen remain out of the chamber threequarters of an hour none of her women accompanied her only donna estafania did she afterward return yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately and when she finally returned	97.3297
did she bring that casket with her no does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket yes the diamond studs which his majesty gave the queen and she came back without this casket yes madame de lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham she is sure of it how can she be so in the course of	115.2862
the day madame de lannoy in her quality of tirewoman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the queen and then the queen the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired he	138.7234
must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or not i have just been with him and the goldsmith the goldsmith has heard nothing of it well well rochefort all is not lost and perhapsperhaps everything is for the best the fact is that i do not doubt your eminences genius will repair the blunders of his agentis that	127.0214

oh my god my god and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming	56.6681
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions	179.8766
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to davrigny and said and now the priest is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked davrigny	134.6113

yes madame are you ready i am and his eminence the cardinal has got off without any accident	89.0536
have you the wick asked the one who carried the lantern	97.3709
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion	186.9564
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved	144.0146
davrigny returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house villefort himself was obliged to open to them	135.3977
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts	87.6499

the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly	664.1183
dartagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion	269.3080
to present our respects to the cardinal porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed dartagnan	93.3900

for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive and once more he bowed low before his highness	85.5428
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last he has done	102.3882
so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten well madame in that case my advicei know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majestymy advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom	148.4626

that is true said dartagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis	52.3305
she was talking with great animation with the stranger	70.7274
monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies	63.7666

her skin was admired for its velvety softness her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable	241.0255
dartagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance	109.9141
dartagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen	182.5709

_non inutile desiderium oblatione_ go to the devil with your latin	218.6266
it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the shortlived satisfaction of his own curiosity	156.5756
he was very pale	33.1282
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice	139.9916

it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports	189.6691
the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom	167.8153
and a type of perfection	306.2717
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to dartagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed	263.4629
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	107.0119

the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh how can i tell	151.1749
his countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principlesa wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by repentance	1195.9147
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	275.7619
and you killed her the monk exclaimed	160.8679
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him	199.2384
these proceedings made dartagnan and porthos draw back	192.5502

it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	77.5179
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward	126.3575
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace	331.6596
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something	169.8514
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the rubycolored liquid	112.3471
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening	72.0089
davrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door	52.7911
no no like shakespeares polonius he died for another	389.6443
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawingrooms come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying	138.5291

you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others	43.1214
what do you want asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone	45.3296
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is a forgery how can that be yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you but it is dartagnan that will come do not deceive yourself	94.7762
villefort entered	187.3409
he came toward teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening	66.4555
i say sire that there is now but one way open	154.5491
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so	96.4808
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after dartagnan	166.5568
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards	41.1025
i confess i can discover no other safe and satisfactory way let us see said aramis how are we to act i have arranged two plans	145.7566
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room	116.4724
and you say sir he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a distance of fifty feet but it appears that this edmond dantès this dangerous mans name was edmond dantès	124.5325
at the same time the door was opened	6.4656
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her	215.8447
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance	135.7966
you want valentine do you not	96.5966
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham	45.9797
i feel cramps over my whole body do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes yes any noise in the ears frightful m when did you first feel that just now suddenly yes like a clap of thunder did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before nothing no drowsiness none what have you eaten today i have eaten nothing	237.7377
i only drank a glass of my masters lemonadethats all and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him	149.2834
do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over	157.8643
he turned towards his wife	26.9466
they have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in passing	376.5152
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations	89.0015
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semicircle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity	128.8309
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos	55.4128

gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw	65.1209
he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness	58.8205
twentyfour years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country	170.8876
the abbé smiled	127.9417
_salite_ said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant	18.8265
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular	112.2570
no one can deny his being a noblehearted young fellow but meanwhile continued m	208.9007
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight halfnaked sailors	132.5586

this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to	80.9371

nothing replied the latter only if the queen has the studs which i very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to hima cry	119.6095
of admiration burst from every mouth	748.1635

porthos looked at dartagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions gascon sharpness continually supplied him	229.8998
i have taken from you one _carte blanche_ to give you another	99.9728
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieus creature my lord	171.9751
a fanatic has just assassinated him ah said rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight his eminence have you informed him of it i wrote to him from boulogne	143.9712
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded	357.8105
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	93.3794
he glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement	642.7997
hush child said she	38.7840
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	164.6270
our family although still rich for my fathers income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence	125.4807
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might	135.5455
be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared	59.1187
m it was the end of september the wind blew violently	75.2293
who knows	76.5696
if you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the other	57.1509
the diminutive abbé scarron who however was an abbé only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of mans which he inhabited	199.7541
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow	94.6935
since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles that is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste	201.4118
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which dartagnan is blindly governed	284.9679
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance	80.8145
now listen to me maximilian if by artifice by entreaty by accidentin short if by any means i can delay this marriage will you wait yes i promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest you will refuse i promise you by	129.7503
all that is most sacred to me in the world namely by my mother we will wait then said morrel	60.7794
they had passed the tête de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery	195.4418
i dare say such a thing might be had very possibly and a pair of oxen as easily found as the cart then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed	141.6226
keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man	216.3796
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	237.4171
the house of morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of morrels warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change	120.2056
when dartagnan returned to the palais royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing	71.8138
she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre	50.3572
dartagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and dartagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince	65.2915
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	77.4746
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town	156.5817
the valet then left the room	58.0807
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland	117.2388
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored	136.0670
his musketeers proceeded and followed him	62.5782
the hundred days m	493.1387
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain	75.0908
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa	288.1698
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it	165.0740
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	142.3126
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty	104.8344
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous	139.3414
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god	88.5627
thank you thank you murmured she	54.0262
you have two unruly prisoners there sir unruly comminges smiled you wish to terrify me i suppose	325.4273
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations	248.4826
you ask what i have against you i tell you	46.7011
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room	29.7519
but dartagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that	41.0254
to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes the paralytic motioned yes valentine took maximilians hand	318.2070
as for me i will give my last sou for it	43.1725
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise what a strange man you are what next	247.6370
at the end of a year dantès was a new man	24.1257
daiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women	507.5597
neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her	105.3523
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel	90.2414
who wants me a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal and who wishes to speak with me who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne then let him come in if you please oh my god my god cried mme	58.6695
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars	175.0979
athos and dartagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	183.6987
believe me you ought now to take a rest	83.5793
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo	32.4779
do you refuse said mercédès in a tremulous voice	56.6572
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty the queen of england and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around	66.8766
him more carefully than before	205.7614
in the first place do you accept asked the cardinal	35.6639
dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegrinder	119.1841
my dear mother said he do you know if m	20.9394
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	67.5113
the monk	660.1506
and you responded to his bidding you imprudent man well i cant say i had much choice of going or not going for i was taken to him between two guards	204.2104
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his body	160.4741
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but i feel assured it will not be for long added she	44.6371
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl	46.6316
necessity has no law besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least	206.7582
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing	171.3693
had happened	228.8495
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench he cried	154.2234
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window	111.0167
during the ligue about which guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction	408.6809
while waiting his assistance i trust to your word you have said that my son should live have you not yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her	171.3140
in that case felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary	169.3066
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner	70.7286
base coward false gentleman cried dartagnan springing forward in his turn after the servant	110.4820
you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready	75.7008
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered	100.1910
he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair	267.9290
i am dying with anxiety	151.3256
yes you talk like a childi repeat the word	225.5055
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	100.7944
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childs room m do you wish to see him i only wish to be alone	52.7531
then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor	94.8603
no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back	122.1602
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive	82.5653
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him yes your excellency andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed	90.9849
thus for instance the excellent abbé adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments really yes i will mention one to you	152.4604
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man	83.9644
alas he said to himself if i only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul	160.0477
of what use is it to be a churchman pray	69.0951
what battle does it represent that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i who has broken his	193.0672
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself	498.5880
i am no swordsman well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter	73.2820
and madame de villefort two m	106.3052
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son	55.7442
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind	128.3046
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh	26.5797
but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened	112.7031
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile we leave paris tomorrow have you nothing more to do there asked morrel	76.7717
a retired baker asked the fruiteress	446.4753
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and dartagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation	90.1884
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where	110.8914
the sound came	282.6859
we shall meet again master dartagnan continued the leader raising his voice	100.9581
count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without valentine the earth is desolate i have told you to hope said the count	146.7040
i shall retire and die tranquillyat home for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron you shall be one and have you not seen any of our other friends yes i have seen aramis and what does he wish	68.9595
you are not joking are you no on the honor of an officer there is the halfpistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him	95.7532
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you our young friend will be extremely well received madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which	77.0053
recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos	101.4891
the carmelite convent at béthune great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes	304.1729
quite alone he asked	135.2018
come let us come to the point	21.8354
buckingham in paris cried he and why does he come to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards no _pardieu_ no to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés oh sire what an idea the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said	137.5454
the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the	130.5180
cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it	142.7170
as soon as possible m	34.4800
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth	90.9886
at length an old wormeaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of dartagnan	186.1296
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham	59.7196
in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses	400.5638
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	47.3650
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to	151.9448
a distance waves of white froth	494.4768
by the way said athos take some pains with your toilet raoul i want you to be approved i hope sir replied the youth smiling that theres no idea of a marriage for me you know of my engagement to louise athos in his turn smiled also	119.9461
the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if i deceive you bring me here againi ask no more the governor laughed	119.3877

m	nan
we have been in this place nearly eightythree hours hem muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering	126.3312
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn	285.7551
he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling	131.2055
de morcerfs	149.6998
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	106.4211

and then said monte cristo this is not all what is there more said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars	47.7621

four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton	155.8151
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name	85.7561
here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten oclock it must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris shall i give you a line for the vicar of st jacques de la	75.9797
boucherie	nan
but what has become of m	26.8530
i always said that dartagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which dartagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence	172.8175
all at once he uttered a terrible cry	30.9998
pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellencys horses monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared	130.7123
mademoiselle de villefort is the culpritshe is the poisoner to you as the kings attorney i denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your duty doctor i resist no longeri can no longer defend myselfi believe you but for pitys sake spare my life my honor m	136.2045
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face	132.4583
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts	48.7880
debray muttered albert	238.5361
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud	709.9883
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps	131.0182
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeeda very probable thing by the byin gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper pack	224.3985
yes yes i see him well enough said dartagnan	30.3094
did you ask for me my good friend said m	23.7604
there is said he at the end of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind human nature in a right and wholesome state revolts at crime	244.7457
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and iat least i understood it so when will it be our turn to think of these things	125.6214
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others	354.1329
go to your chamber said she to mme	62.4475
dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the water	96.7544
one may be very comfortable in a convent and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated i promise you on my part good cried athos good yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly	101.4313
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney	115.3564
yes replied the old man	9.7578
m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with	226.1608
a melancholy smile	177.9347
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to dartagnans face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king	99.7240
help cried dartagnan	63.5790
open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed	136.5504

the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice	83.6729
it was thought reliance might be placed in general quesnel he was recommended to us from the island of elba one of us went to him and invited him to the rue saintjacques where he would find some friends	56.5836

de tréville who detected him at once	44.7242
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtiers lips seemed to start from his eyes	62.1522
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	82.6536
ay said porthos if we cannot leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis	72.1242

and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my	131.9160
childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous so young said albert forgetting at the moment the counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name haydée turned her eyes	266.5819
towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέspeak nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness m speak speak signora said albert i am listening with	164.0409
the most intense delight and interest to all you say haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile	163.1501
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	145.2996
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m	88.5871
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him	88.3204
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saintméran coffins	281.8246
the dead are everywhere said morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles	114.3022

it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries	84.1358

the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague	242.5066
you must depart instantly monsieur	404.8035
tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for let us rather persevere in our researches they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted dartagnan to rueil	146.7362
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far	149.0539
i do not jest said athos	25.6865
conferences	nan
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	331.7391
mm	nan
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep	209.9609

scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle a faintness seized him a cloud of blood passed over his eyes and he fell in the middle of the street crying still coward coward coward he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to dartagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young	110.3172
man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before	169.1203
yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel and he heaved a sigh	211.9878
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets	71.0480
and for whomfor some _grisette_ some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison	466.0408
adieu madame	73.6964
his honors equipage is waiting said mousqueton	621.0244
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse oh exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish	168.1941
she ran to the window and opened it	17.0557
what are these things he asked	45.1031
is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarchs _life of alexander_	187.8699
the camp had entered saint omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen	80.6899
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	167.3179
well for my part i shall go to bed said dartagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend	85.3954
bonacieux	nan

come no hypocrisy you know that i dont like it	92.2554
teresa said luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the counts daughter yes replied teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish and i replied very well you shall have it yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but	100.6325
of course your reply was only to please me i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly	96.9432
i say that he has hastily accused your majestys musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself	98.4412
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied bazin	167.7257
but youis there nothing that you want we came here with the intention of asking for something to eat alas they have taken everything there isnt a morsel of bread in the house you hear dartagnan said athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner it is all one to me now said dartagnan i am no longer hungry faith neither	124.5961
am i said porthos	48.1671
it was evident he had his orders	34.9764
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs	75.4652
thanks my brave friend cried milady and when shall i be avenged tomorrowimmediatelywhen you please milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward dartagnan	114.8945
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related	95.6658
see how deadly pale he is my child my darling edward speak to your motheropen your dear eyes and look on me once again oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the	132.7507
distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the childs lips	171.6464
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages	56.0544
escape as lord de winter had thought miladys wound was not dangerous	76.2219
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the threenone other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and shell soon tell us where her money is it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or	247.7265
see anything that took place within our dwelling	371.7538
faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death	178.8703
stop and let us talk talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos	83.6198
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child	71.1955
then turning towards albertit is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydée speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor	128.2018
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	74.0140
wrapped in this sweet idea dartagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment	107.0047
i should not have guessed it	39.8009
the city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender the mayor had hanged the mutineers	291.0058
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port wine ah port wine tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst	246.8580
what you do not know have you neglected to obtain information on that point	60.6819
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m	305.1582
friend porthos said dartagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy	56.3479
de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs dartagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane	63.8090
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the	310.4250
features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself	235.3818
do i	120.8959
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers	61.1236
he sent us home in his own carriage	104.1694
the jailer was right dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad	356.9016
bonacieux accosted him	498.7949
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already threequarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest	58.2613
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger	121.1415
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain	131.3228
de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse	36.1053
then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation	57.9935
father father in heavens name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	59.9342
milady smiled and dartagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile	103.1489
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends	54.5036
dartagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice	62.5634
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didnt mean mischiefthats my opinion too said the captain and ill take precautions accordingly	150.4361
de tréville contented himself with asking dartagnan if he could do anything for him but dartagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted	60.6569
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain	230.2547
but you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus	149.9407
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the kings attorney and this kings attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly	64.2206
coquenard who knew that a simpleminded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal	169.9710
i cannot reconcile myself to this ideait would madden me	315.7234
debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain	119.9347
i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end said the stranger	80.6453
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber	115.2710
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness athos smiled	366.9028
a lover is never terrible he said	261.9370
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out	112.7197
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces	105.1277
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him	72.7931
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started	63.3178
yes sire yes it is the same and your majesty has a good memory come how shall we decide said the king	52.7052
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that _ventrebleu_ cried dartagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one	151.3453
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long night	63.9905
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them with	221.7230
it is past noon said she and today is saturday i dare say it is the doctor grandpapa noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition	136.0473
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses	441.8747

ghosts chapter	222.8072
and madame de villefortcharming peoplem	546.3578
thin and lanky the executioner said dartagnan and aramis at the same time	43.5877
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	43.4078
dartagnan remained standing and examined this man	71.2856
i have served them without enthusiasmgod knows that i estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteembut on principle	174.4340
no it had just struck four	174.6714
did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing	633.7635
to me to you to us take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in	112.7327
order to be able to purchase them do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father	90.0756
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle	63.4290
the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future	53.0823
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my lord from france cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came	151.0253
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name	194.8488
we have arranged the ransom of each of them on arriving in france	63.7643
when the name of colonel fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial	123.7352
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light	123.8871
this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and the stagecoach	235.3178
buckingham saw by the expression of the young mans face what was passing in his mind and he smiled	32.6106
a fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day	149.3864
the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door	170.5317
help murder help cried he	388.8037
the count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest	173.9896
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn but	132.6335
father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping i do not understand you you rely on the usurpers return we do you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble	97.0528
on the th or th he will be at lyons and on the th or th at paris the people will rise yes to go and meet him he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him yes to escort him into the capital	98.3944
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie	169.7594
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them	192.8095
we have made considerable advances and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him porthos is wounded then i cannot tell you monsieur what you cannot tell me	75.1903
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed	48.4758
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze	261.7866
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank	97.5539
there is everything in a jesuit convent then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized god pardon me said dartagnan to himself i believe he has become	86.8160
more gascon than i am then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner but i have expected you to tell me well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please	65.8092
prince though he is hold on wait said aramis that is an idea of which i invite you to take advantage my friend	61.5216
to the swords be it so replied dartagnan that is exactly what i want dartagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause	184.9781
a sacerdotal officer	4448.6094
on being left alone with mme	260.1111
we have only the vulture to deal with	96.1919
i dont know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was ratherrather strong in greek he spoke the romaic language did he i think so that settles it murmured franz	121.3391
i am at home to nobody said milady observe to _nobody_ the servant went out	142.3549
who told you so	29.6522
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join	285.4349
this cavalier is my attendant would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host	140.2403
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes wateringpots hung against the wall this was all the furniture	374.7587
the marines were removed	294.0062
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt	142.2092
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crestfallen minister instead of aiding to crush him	153.9993
felton remained behind he held a book in his hand	56.1753
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from m	40.5078
barrois cried valentine barrois i am coming mademoiselle replied he	121.4089
do you still wish to dispose of all yes but they will contest the will after your death no my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph	142.8128
i want friends i want faithful servants	510.8037
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars	125.3932
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline	249.0029
of a dream	118.2734
skirmishing	nan
the felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave tonight we have nothing more to do here you are in a hurry sir count said dartagnan	53.2509
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my fathers revenue i said danglars have always intended giving my daughter francs as her dowry she is besides my sole heiress all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing	182.8224
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing	89.9295
stopbutit is very strangeoh my god my head swims i cannot see help help my friends her hands are icy cold cried dartagnan	184.9745
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme	160.0641
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew	191.5451
alas poor albert none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those	244.6672
of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity	206.0540
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle very well said dartagnan his eyes aflame battle it is a long time since we have had a battle eh porthos battle cried porthos	112.7935
no we have had great annoyances there	394.0315
it is true she said the arch hypocritesee i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces	193.8734
on the following morning at five oclock dartagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mothers recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing	225.2054
the assistance of any doctor dartagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow	137.5222
have you admired the rapidity of my fall	178.0592
but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden	68.8950
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect who was your brother asked he	89.4842
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria	37.1483
in which the plot thickens chapter xii	291.6221
the anterooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards	364.5065
but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards	132.4266
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing	666.6934
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given	62.6354
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage i shall pass all my life thought dartagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct	210.2877
m	nan
and what is the news you should not ask a stranger a foreigner for news i know it but in asking for news i mean have you done anything for me had you commissioned me said monte cristo feigning uneasiness	106.0838
dartagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon dartagnans sword	176.1064
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan m _ma foi_ said franz it would be the easiest thing in	69.2123
the world for i feel eagles wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in fourandtwenty hours ah yes the hashish is beginning its work	184.5665
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread	233.2383
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse	152.9751
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor	115.9524
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate	66.9073
the sergeant made a sign of comprehension	50.7077
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra	184.3946
you are free tonight without fighting so much the better how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin	107.7197
what jealousy to tear such clothes he looks like a bigbug said another dresses in fine style	572.8900
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m	76.9331
i have told you that i am prepared for anything the two travelers knocked at the door	29.2182
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune	259.7429
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff	173.0470
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity	136.4910
which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said	90.7409
michon seamstress tours_ the three friends looked at one another and laughed they were caught	134.4622
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina	179.4571
come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army	100.0148
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her	61.7868
and to you also m	208.1180
still the same story of superfluities now i think we are rich since instead of the francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of but we owe something in this house thirty francs but i pay that out of my francsthat is understoodand as i require only eighty francs for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury	107.2978
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jackinthebox	98.5755
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	49.2131
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient	176.0500
is not the greatest thief in the world monsieur the kings secretary le camus who came to paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions the dog shook his head	81.8238
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	206.5296
what could she have done to you	33.7374
danglars disappearance	1122236.1250
de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin	561.8848
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier	79.8490
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door	78.2702
i do not wish to be left alone mother said the young man you know how gladly i would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening well replied mercédès sighing go albert i will not make you a slave to your filial piety albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his	107.9894
mother and quitted her	76.1014
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me	107.8452
henrietta maria and mazarin	250.2877
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges	84.7496

the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way	58.5521
where has he gone asked monsieur de cavois	50.2989
he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his eminence aramis then joined athos and dartagnan who were consulting together	78.9563
feltons orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline	124.7720
the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the righthand crypt belonging to the saintméran family	203.3377
on this paved yard are to be seenpacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadowsthe men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening	441.6649
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her goodnight for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill	164.5864
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	76.7146
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty	457.5111
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter	62.6880
gentlemen said dartagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity	58.3948
three compartments divided the coffer	818.3395
the abbé shook his head	30.3355
m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered	74.4314
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer	326.0393
and bazin asked athos	207.9921
do you wish a step or some place in the government sir will you grant me my request let us hear what it is first sir when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer let me see that order if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill when you have cherished a wish and have charged	129.2434
me with its fulfillment have i ever replied it is impossible but a request preferred with so much preparation ah do not fear sir said mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request proceed sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me	147.5246
have them for their ransom	219.7894
oh the scotch he exclaimed the scotch i called my faithful to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford the scotch my brothers but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated todaythis morning so your majesty must perceive there	208.0566
is no time to lose to do what	72.8491
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing	233.2849
for example you see these two fish one brought from fifty leagues beyond st petersburg the other five leagues from naples	163.0216
haydée chapter	287.3367
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor	78.1119
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are i rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saintméran insist that m	134.8178
all faithful hearts with me cried out winter	841.6671
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at	83.8978
athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	72.5508
his wife he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of _his_ irreproachable virtueshe a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme willshe might at that very moment perhaps be preparing	235.6992
to die an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husbanda forgiveness she was purchasing with her death villefort again groaned with anguish and despair	171.2402
the sailors did not require much urging	468.6993
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent	115.9896
neither gold nor rank you have given me all you can give me and from today your debt is paid and mordaunt darted out of the generals tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy	181.0115
in a dungeon which good lord in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror	182.3763
is the abbé at home asked he	58.1637
but how to die	96.8078
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform you have evidently seen and observed everything let us proceed oh yes yes now as	195.1636
regards the second question i am listening was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès yes a young man who loved her and his name was fernand that is a spanish name i think he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the letter oh no he would more likely have got rid of me	96.8101
by sticking a knife into me that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no one not even to your mistress no not even to	187.3475
my betrothed then it is danglars i feel quite sure of it now wait a little	85.4980
should you not have known me again in spite of my eightandforty years of age on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all i understand cried athos with a gentle blush	41.1335
what are you going to do asked the wounded man	8.8688
then dartagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers	49.7299
dartagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments	65.6577
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria	50.5649
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight and dartagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper	65.1370
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dantès	38.2097
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenants sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal	65.9605
no matter	236.9099
is it thus you perform your charge monsieur continued the king without directly replying to de trévilles question	284.4298
i am in his majestys guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied but it appears to me that my guardsmineare also his majestys guards and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words you want a pretext do you not	142.0014
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of belshazzar	202.8564
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time let us see what this letter contains we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england	205.3840
and he touched his mule	161.3732
the others my lord the secondi heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the comte de la fere	183.7734
depend upon it i know what i say	34.0534
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment how you are going soon asked milady	137.4754
well said dartagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death athos shook his head	37.4543
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service dartagnan i shall be grateful to you all my life very well	79.8857
andrea cavalcanti a murderera galleyslave escapeda convict an ironical smile curled the lip of eugénie	498.5174
seek them my lord and find them i conjure you i will search for them madame said de winter and doubtless i shall find them but time fails me	67.1334
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	128.5328
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m	24.4778
what are you saying doctor he exclaimed raising his hands to heaven	45.3479
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count	39.0066
dont be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house	107.6508
your eminence said comminges as i was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door	96.7288
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened	74.4964
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance	130.3026
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	377.9243
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	96.5017
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than thatfor a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head	200.9426
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieillechapelle and la venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	130.7069
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	149.7427
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself	371.6402
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we	147.7130
may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglarsso be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during	151.8447
that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned	150.0686
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved	41.5204
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself	169.9125
how grateful will m	2389.3750
no sire replied athos	39.1845
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps	598.4742
delaunay in which he offers to purchase the goodwill of the house to unite with his own for francs	101.8286
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his homeyes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house	130.9669
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea	172.2430
a lieutenant in the corsican battalion a soldier of the usurper then a soldier of the french army well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword you are mistaken monsieur i replied he has perished by the poniard what do you want me to do asked the magistrate	69.6127
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	184.8281
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in	198.9497
the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	211.5669
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands	57.1733
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment	146.3877
comminges villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men	234.3923
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	62.1949
in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen	273.3102
how asked blaisois i can	83.8637
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart	92.1300
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father	78.7102
ah sir he exclaimed it was you without you i was a dead manthrice dead but one recovers sir as you perceive replied raoul and we have but had a little bath oh sir what gratitude i feel exclaimed the man with gray hair	123.2928
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs	111.3765
in gods name answer me he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	74.8361
i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it	48.9761
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose	410.2324
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes	129.0868
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her	83.3793
oh the devil thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours oh lord no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as i cannot possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud which i have	126.1484
not yet had time to remove the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions dartagnan had conceived	122.4310
the tie is even more direct it seems to me oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness	147.9164
mademoiselle darmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the germans are so fond	196.6220
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also monte cristo gently smiled and saidi was there at the same time pointing to the corner of a street	239.5292
the breakfast at m	334.0774
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	212.3361
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview say no more of that madame said felton	114.1187
for a mind so perspicuous as that of dartagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	167.9910
i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy	148.0322
dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	155.5361
you see it makes a very respectable appearance _pardieu_ cried dartagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme	120.7905
how should he have been otherwise	75.2405
how convenient that theres a bench here	697.5054
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror	107.0857
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	91.3374
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way and you will pay ready money m and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of banknotes which might have been twice the sum m	86.1742
it was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern	72.1208
then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is said he	95.0362
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen	105.5016
a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen	321.6993
well cried porthos	65.5846
a table ready set out awaited them	409.7498
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo	136.5606
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	50.6889
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès but for youin the words of the gospel seek and you shall find i have found already what i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself pooh women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what	124.8182
she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself thats what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever	254.2732
the kings request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athoss heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom	280.4497
i think you wished to do so of your own accord you are right madame said the king and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me	32.8179
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united	93.3949
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman	168.4830
nothingat least personally said monte cristo	68.8002
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces	123.4378
ah you scoundrel cried dartagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword	64.3578
where asked maximilian	292.3826
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys	53.8681
de tréville	2.9157
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i cannot understand how any man can really love her the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison no but tell meit is	129.3250
a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	104.7918
just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray	30.3480
and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man	152.7145
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited	64.4000
no you were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to fly	250.1330
it is imousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road	71.6448
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raouls departure	101.4873
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again	254.2289
i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame de saintméran	54.4254
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all	111.0872
mme	nan
a black point floated on the sea	231.4238
may i be permitted to inform my wife said he	50.0720
yes these three _yeses_ had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation	389.6870
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets	324.2781
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together impossible said dartagnan we are under mazarins orders i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours besides said aramis	156.8024
had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like dartagnan and porthos	221.5331
davrigny cried she in a stifled voice	30.3046
he remained listening and gazing	182.8167
come raoul he said let us follow this man the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst athos and raoul descended	160.1010
the matter is gallant	451.7022
well resumed the citizen well monsieur my wife was abducted yesterday morning as she was coming out of her workroom and by whom was your wife abducted i know nothing surely monsieur but i suspect someone and who is the person whom you suspect a man who has pursued her a long time the devil but allow me to tell you monsieur continued	88.2567
the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this less love than politics replied dartagnan with a reflective air and what do you suspect i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect monsieur i beg you to observe that i ask you absolutely nothing	57.5158
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked debray	164.3031
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together	567.9795
speak gentlemen speaki am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing	2536.2258
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count	212.3787
do you see the waistcoat	60.4799
i have replied dartagnan	47.7848
speak then chevalier said the cardinal	31.0122
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart tomorrow dartagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen days	84.7715
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres good god cried she two thousand livres why that is a fortune porthos made a most significant grimace mme	141.1841
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly	157.2120
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	123.2868
monte cristo opened the carriagedoor morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps	64.7858
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at work yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it	188.1545
if he wishes it to last long do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening i hope so monsieur well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables perhaps there is but one at this moment but by	118.6624
this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said dartagnan and nodding to planchet he went out	130.1264
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall	118.8009
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god	126.7745
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	44.4927
m	nan
to cours la reine cried dartagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance	137.2103
meanwhile what are you going to do i yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true	55.7771
chapter xxvii	54.5606
wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it	29.3725
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered miladys apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends	135.4418
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him	113.9679
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms	95.9807
albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new toothpowder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering these	153.7170
papers become more and more stupid every day a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m	98.6581
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english	77.2822
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and dartagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever	127.3655
on reaching the palace dartagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay	35.2182
but though he held the cardinals promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos	242.9684
what ails you my dearest father	39.5105
i am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground	24.6735
who is that swiss asked dartagnan	101.7758
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances	141.1865
read for yourself and judge porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur dartagnan who must follow the bearer well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied dartagnan	81.1995
and sir where does he reside pray the comte de la fere lodges in the rue guenegaud hotel du grand roi charlemagne thanks sir	114.3061
the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast	78.8810
but you will remain you are not afraid said dartagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lackey	85.2447
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	217.9337
de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinals guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making _sortie_ against the kings musketeers	93.9480
his lookingglass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper	237.5707
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself	135.8244
you cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek	97.4265
what is it cried many persons present	183.6864
morrel but still he is charged with what inquired the elder dantès	141.6088
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard	88.3319
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in	55.0308
dartagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions	183.9297
the cardinals house had no secrets for me	119.2963
my friend said athos he has given me news of raoul and now gentlemen said planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do reenter paris if you will let us my good planchet let you sir	55.8531
it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name	242.4485
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue	248.6184
he was very taciturn this worthy signor	441.8477
milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel	97.4437
yes a base coward murmured dartagnan but sheshe was very beautiful what _she_ demanded the host	251.3682
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him	36.7179
i had only to cry out help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free why didnt you do it asked the lieutenant	67.4675
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall	61.6982
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but dartagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis	97.8116
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each others prudence how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine	257.9542
dartagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in dartagnans proposal pooh who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you i am lieutenant in his majestys musketeers said dartagnan and consequently your superior in everything only as the question now is	96.5032
not of rank but of quartersyou know the customcome and seek for yours the first to return will recover his chamber dartagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who	140.8817
had affronted her by the refusal of her hand	66.0361
danglars dined here yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m	369.2491
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence i thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	98.1179
de saintmérans oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte dartois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence yes they were talking about it when we left paris said m	197.7149
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven oclock and to bring emmanuel	57.3015
i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel	150.0708
m indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does	82.0988
sang diou let them come on besidesdo you see that door athos yes what then well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air i recognize you there my brave dartagnan replied athos but you are no longer our masters	87.9574
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majestys example and not get killed for your folly in this den set your mind at rest replied athos	163.5070
but it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers	164.8848
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur darminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the counts two grooms	88.9267
i cannot have deceived myself he said i must look upon the past in a false light	70.3298
i pardon you for my blasted future my lost honor my defiled love and my salvation forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me	271.2968
the young king approached his mother and said why do as these people ask it must be so my son said anne of austria	55.6219
the servant entered just as he had finished	59.2781
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes	42.5583
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you	46.0689
are you there now _certes_ replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle the _fingers_ resumed the jesuit st peter blessed with the _fingers_	205.4377
during this time porthos played close	110.6225
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmonds favor	82.9356
you seek me sir said he	28.4041
to what country demanded porthos	239.3796
they opened it and found francs in bank scrip	477.7916
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him	121.5516
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers	209.0115
let us wait by all means	78.0663
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul	101.7229

bonacieux the comtesse de winter the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the rest	74.8149

i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible rage	160.2663
chapter xlvi	100.6191
it is a color very well known in botany but till the present time very rare among horses there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master cried the young emulator of the furious tréville	155.7588
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m	146.7776
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic	83.2706
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you likethat is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached	68.1205
in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for dartagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered	76.8855
m	nan
yes that first and other things afterward speak it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks yes	121.7501
particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you me yes you	49.5668
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods	508.8877
whats that asked porthos what are they firing at now	151.8469
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation	171.7177
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections	217.3211
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion it matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs	141.4870
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate	115.9757
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident as to the rest m	126.7962
where do you keep your wine no no thanks	90.6540
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen	220.4678
bonacieux was	12.0924
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write	149.0665
to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him	49.4870
well asked aramis	37.0960
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situatedneither too near paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility	295.7533
dartagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit	234.0989
like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every means of attack and defence i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials i taught my arm to slay my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to smile at the	219.8228
most horrid spectacles	3196.6008
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct	163.3620
fight on all occasions	381.5500
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady	27.3789
we must fire as long as we have loaded guns	89.3548
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend	39.9594
athos and aramis were more and more astonished	53.5190
de tréville waited for the king	18.7762
it concerns me much said dartagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since and since asked the swiss	162.4647
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second	105.1072
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him then continued châteaurenaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champsélysées you only want a mistress albert smiled	195.9681
father and son m	35.8883
he promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is striking	174.2335
well then you must be registered as charlotte backson milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror	133.2973
have you not perceived it it may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won oh difficulties do not affright me said dartagnan	101.1917
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth	64.7544
singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocketbook	177.8336
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brotherinlaw with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy	106.6844
but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur dartagnan you cannot think so dear love replied dartagnan but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from	92.9556
the moment he deceived me he merited death he shall die then since you condemn him said dartagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion	143.1446
by mordaunt yes but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us	165.1198
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood	172.1167
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of dartagnan and porthos	77.9688
then dartagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not succeed	132.5744
but tell me all about it why do you wish to know asked cavalcanti	38.2519
they passed the barrier without accident	105.0238
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large irongray horse	141.2741
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere	47.4731
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of portovecchio	80.2298
dartagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes	244.2419
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled	128.1067
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded	238.4606
chapter lxvi	31.7292
oh you know it tell them tell them and the young mans voice was choked by sobs	74.6999
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use	142.3451
this immediately recalled to dartagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme	113.7145
the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as _cicerone_ by showing you a specimen of a bachelors apartment	131.0775
what do you mean	4.1339
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight	117.9762
we have our clothes some more splendid than othersthis is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for thirdrate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the	142.5653
locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it	125.2694
the _moccoli_ or _moccoletti_ are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple withfirst how to keep his own _moccoletto_ alight and secondly how to extinguish the _moccoletti_ of others	267.1531
not even me asked the count with deep emotion	54.6685
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation	112.1244
you heardcavalcanti that tells me their name and nothing else ah true	231.6509
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of ré with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the comte de toiras who commanded for the king in the isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing	137.2603
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saintjacques the affair in the rue saintjacques exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation	95.3633
stop there madame for this cannot last	611.8465
he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes	45.6930
there are the acts signed i deliver them to you without compulsion	219.1440
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed	122.0126
and youwhat will you become	158.4308
give me my felt hat bernouin the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim	358.4898
but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose i die after my own manner i die exhausted and brokenspirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cellthat is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues no sooner had this idea taken possession of him	183.4983
than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a wornout garment	261.7946
edmond was intensely interested	388.5573
dead repeated a third voice	181.2592
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking	150.5154
your eminence may believe added dartagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little	87.2947
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust	202.1789
it was a _coupé_ of kollers building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas	160.0037
oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face i do not condemn you albert i only restrain you	110.0676
well but we should be taken out of prison madame bonacieux was released	99.3856

albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position	347.6832
faria saw this	59.5157
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became	129.0752
ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart	130.7425
he fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling	129.7224
it was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in	58.8410
athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men illdisposed to allow themselves to be taken	68.6146
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiersall proved the great richelieu no longer in existence	287.5659
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound	144.7755
oh my god my god cried mme	25.4966
let me kill him we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes	136.4958
these are frenchmen i imagine ifaith i dont know	154.6655
then i saw that they took me for the assassin	55.5133
in your case it would be a crime	44.8618
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would	41.5328
on these days he spoke a little	62.2969
at halfpast six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times you think so my lord answered la ramee	188.7124
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage	160.6090
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms	67.7097
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic your thesis are you then making a thesis without doubt replied the jesuit	167.9136
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball	137.3910
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	117.5164
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercers house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the	153.0424
rue du bac	101.8044
do you go and i will stay and take care of the wounded man and give up your share of the venture said edmond to remain with me yes said jacopo and without any hesitation you are a good fellow and a kindhearted messmate replied edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions but i do not wish anyone to stay	81.3516
with me	83.0231
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of feltonthe only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a	131.7915
serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination	484.7040
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf	214.2612
dartagnan entered behind him	55.3086
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him	379.8900
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room	144.2951
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	178.2226
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude	119.6629
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the redandyellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller	235.0316
i alsoi love you	151.8524
dartagnan trembled	662.7786
see to these horses	261.5291
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period	178.8996
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me m the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dantès	226.5103
well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals	98.4221
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious	95.5391
annes head was bent downshe had not seen the italians smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up	317.6323
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saintjacques	39.7073
she should have wanted nothing have you ever seen the queen of england inquired dartagnan	94.1750
it is true that the indulgence of his fostermother encouraged him	41.5097
the sentinel opened the door it was a new face	41.5859
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	148.8081
de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the kings attorney	135.1053
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did why so inquired dantès	210.6062
signed abbé busoni it is the same what do you mean said the major	38.0352
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would	76.5281
be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you m noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans	136.4552
mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	121.7758
here we are said athos	18.8241

one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis	268.7710
it was just in time for valentines head swam and she staggered madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event who could have thought it	118.1480
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service	67.2851
very well sir said monte cristo	6.6100
spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate _à latere_ who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him	222.1596
spada set out about two oclock to san pierdarena	75.1174
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces	167.2132
i guess what brings you here how and why because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject by whom by a banker of paris my correspondent whose name is danglars he cried albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred	143.1948

as for porthos on whom dartagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute	79.7911

i opened the door of the anteroom myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make dartagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time	72.6092

here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured	43.0255
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning	135.8791
dartagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side	119.5725

bonacieuxlamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomedthe two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting	117.0015

not another step he said or you are a dead man what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other who are you inquired the sentinel	120.1048
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	90.2051
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal	81.6226

she believed the order ready for execution	402.1144
m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights	226.6029

_morbleu_ said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet _morbleu_ i wont be their dupe i will answer for it	124.3106
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master	81.6847
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action	237.5184

the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend	57.4168
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends	200.2120

her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed	234.7447

from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh	788.7164
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically	477.6510
so said charles he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere sire said aramis	52.7227
he will come and visit the comte de la fere dartagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him	72.4857
but your release can be managed	734.6501
it is i said dartagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de wardes oh my god my god murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named well said milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter	58.7621

the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	119.8352
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by dartagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villarscotterets	131.2540
he made a sign which i understood but the kings guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard	71.1686
beauchamp announced the servant	113.7708
why do you like that best because then i have no responsibility	78.4084
their joy was great	869.6980
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse	66.5075
go i will reflect gondy looked at mazarin astonished and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal	66.5882
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry	112.6872
he pointed his finger to the lighted window	135.2365

dartagnan approached her with his usual gallantry	95.9791
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances	145.2917
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said dartagnan	85.4369
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection	54.6730

he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	273.9552
dartagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient	101.1965

those two words _your mass_ and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in	111.6983

the minutes passed madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine	88.2957
the fool the ass the idiot how so if he loved her asked dartagnan	351.1015
the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill	53.5774
and madame danglars will think me a very illmannered person	152.5289
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	50.0320
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh	103.5207

on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall _oh god_ he read _preserve my memory_ oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful	157.5148
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing	774.9711

he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes	115.6539

seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majestys service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the	99.6793
cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour	180.4489
before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal	53.6808

have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank godfor it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me	139.5778
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking	59.7076
come said dartagnan all this leads to nothing	84.3126
he preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	179.4722
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty	61.4135
for the moment she wished nothing better	119.2133
although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all dartagnan wished	247.1556
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friends hand gained the summit	175.6905
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise	82.5903
behind us a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	218.2730

let us drink my dear dartagnan _morbleu_ let us drink while the wine is fresh let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder chapter xxvii	83.3831
come hither i say and dont be afraid continued athos	96.3494
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	491.0803
my dear count we have only just begun what induces you to think so the knowledge that i have of the queens heart she will not rest contented beaten is she then preparing for a stroke i hope so come let us see what you know i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army ah	102.7449
ha said rochefort you are right	23.3934
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian	196.9646
a handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not my faith said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you	122.4931
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	118.0466
how much in that little bag seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs seven thousand livres cried porthos	155.4208
once outside the city dartagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood	156.0277
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known	161.7576
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain	52.7098
well said porthos seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette to dartagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the palais royal did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend ifaith yes a brute that cardinal	76.2703
morrel good worthy man said caderousse	251.5848
we say _almost_ for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens it	118.7875
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his	299.0100
head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers	206.0310
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out monsieur de gondy the cardinals enemy no the kings friend said aramis the kings friend you understand	143.2020
the man in the mask	59.3004
this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry	75.6787
from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume	83.7884
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon dartagnan when he spared the life of her brother	179.6102
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so nobleminded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love	161.2043
or rather delirium	313.5049
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	236.3683
now to the point	76.1755
there was a moments silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir	195.0818
m	nan
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	76.6610
the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother	58.6719
you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme goodhumor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francsno matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter	147.9684
now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here i am ready it is important that none of your crew should see me i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself	62.0959
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court and what are they oh he doesnt stand well with his eminence mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some ceremony ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only	201.0869
going then to make a visit oh yes of course mouston nothing else	130.3084
i have chosen a trade a trade	185.6670
no and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there	116.4609
dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	46.8704
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with franknessfor then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth	69.6596
they descended into the plain by the ladder	58.1350
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day	128.3210
you appear to think much of your horse	128.2254
what does all this mean asked aramis	51.7319
i spurred on and found myself in the enemys ranks and the prince was pleased with you he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken	68.8326
m	nan
when i returned she was married	74.0448
monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france in some parts of franceyes excellency you know the environs of paris then no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude	100.9876
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moments reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me and what shall i say to the people that they must have patience said anne as i have the fiery spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out	70.0007
the door at last opened albert de morcerf entered first and i began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed ah here is the baron franz dépinay i summoned all my strength and courage to my support	155.3644
as for me when i have no candle i cant take two steps without knocking against something thats because you havent served said mousqueton	177.2695
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting	197.5217
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely reechoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty	163.9178
dartagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m	67.5561
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed	100.6379
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people	42.3769
will you dine with me asked harrison of dartagnan	78.9889
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him	74.7240
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m	51.2719
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m	126.1274
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences valentine seized the counts hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips	114.2144
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer	119.7019
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	268.4579
edward endured the accident with miraculous couragehe did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over	159.1354
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz	73.9349
for the rest this vengeance was very easy for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself	106.4282
what is it asked villefort rushing from his room	30.7132
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate	72.1466
one of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore	367.9879
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you for monsieur de wardes said kitty	66.3154
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	68.3749
what ails you baron he exclaimed	54.0851
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half	119.7904
noirtier whom you see here	125.6356
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch but will it not be lost oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up a gardener grimaud nodded	92.4686
the bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges	161.0365
you have had three horses foundered or killed he asked me	191.3886
if his heart is free and he will marry haydée the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish	68.0760
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	111.1397
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus	232.4003
no pity for him who had no pity die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan	149.7029
noirtier and returned to the sick man	30.4982
good answered grimaud and he went right to the prisoner	67.0997
he wished once again to press the counts hand but his own was immovable	131.3505
look and dartagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	271.0317
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments	215.4347
these are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my mothers	161.5477
just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road	427.0049
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained	135.2009
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour	66.7940
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear	110.3895
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag	217.5442
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur i am a criminal as it appears	110.9726
these were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village	159.2418
it was then that the door of edwards room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared	86.0317
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded	131.4790
porthos chapter xxvi	436.7488
we shall arrive at eight oclock	17.3979
if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masterswarranted as such	152.5983
monsieur the coadjutors carriage she exclaimed falling back	268.2375
and this is the reason monsieur continued maximilian of my sister and brotherinlaw having only francs a year maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the counts heart had swelled within him when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat	185.3921
and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will dothat will do monsieur bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements	280.0544
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking halfpast nine	240.9962
bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and curiosity	348.5525
the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic	218.6018
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy ah said mazarin breathing more freely	122.7468
it was in fact mordaunt whom dartagnan had followed without knowing it	69.1998
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitors emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone	175.3712
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him oh count said de winter for whom do you take me for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way de winter shook him by the hand	64.2686
we have a rendezvous you remember at the place royale ah stop hold your peace porthos dont remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday	212.9230
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long forgotten then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy	92.8894
ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france	46.1914
monsieur dartagnan he cried falling back a step it is monsieur dartagnan let him pass dartagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard	82.4804
taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation without bowing at the feet of satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth	135.2992
nothing replied grimaud	94.2204
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer perhaps you like repose she said	121.7230
you will in turn enter it my dear dépinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family	118.4469
whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard	63.4341
bonacieux alone the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptiedjustice not being one of the three things which king solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage	211.9870
nothing replied bonacieux nothing	177.5910
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set off	115.1943
swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited	186.7498
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dantes damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels	276.4795
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening	73.3203
both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about	35.6206
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	82.7455
count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the world so much the worse why asked monte cristo	58.1009
at ten oclock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the kings guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel	93.3100
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	71.3544
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture	93.3677
for what reason is all this fume and fury asked athos	99.7212
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so	176.9922
courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m	281.3399
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning	74.7253
julie hesitated	1603.0938
andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in rue de la chaussée dantin	156.0493
the door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to all	159.6607
he is really king of paris he cant go out without being mobbed by his admirers ah so much the better can we have the honor of seeing his highness i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on	97.2505
ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle	138.8298
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	109.1845
pyramus and thisbe chapter	56.1165
sit down morrel and wait morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven	219.0781
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground	91.8027

suppose we warn the masters lets wait for grimaud but perhaps they have killed him grimaud would have cried out you know he is almost dumb we should have heard the blow then but if he doesnt return here he is at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes	115.7785
staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them	148.8058
lackaday if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle	177.4246

beforehand they parted	235.7011
quiet was at length restored	209.7926
on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced	101.3649
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace	165.4984

the lackey bowed and let them pass	109.5943

hang it cried dartagnan another twenty pistoles lost	281.0429
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme	359.0385
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it	102.8951
i breathe more freely in fact porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs	252.2948
there was no further question therefore about marie michon among the four musketeers who besides had what they wanted that was the order to withdraw mme	123.1574
suppose a watchman should pass and he blew out the light	160.7533
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her dartagnan which is not the part of a gentleman we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop bah said dartagnan	113.9752
they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it	91.0358
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him	22.6408

the young mens hands look for on my soul it is curious	347.5143
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only servingman whom he had left	75.5925
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet	53.7724
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat	69.8496
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars	312.1142
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of or livres	132.6468
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell	79.4555

de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze	136.9894
they were approaching the scene of war and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow	79.8391
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends	80.1219

during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction	134.2741

she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs	93.7372
athos did not even turn his head	55.8618
danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage	45.8970
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you in a very simple manner colonel said dartagnan	227.1654
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	219.3630
it was already too late	43.9229
dartagnan was worn out with fatigue	146.6481
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness	918.7234
you know noirmont do you not	83.3470
this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows	360.0541
no pardon my frankness too my lord i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence you make me young and happy again by it	140.4424
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together it is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet	143.9816
this circumstance pleased m	1323.1151
bravo count bravo it is frank at least said morrel	187.9256
it followed that dartagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friendsathos porthos and aramis	99.7780
we have still fifteen days before us said he to his friends well if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing or rather if nothing has come to find me as i too good a catholic to kill myself with a pistol bullet i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminences guards or with eight englishmen and	90.8344
i will fight until one of them has killed me which considering the number cannot fail to happen	179.4841
he saw that it was a merciless war between usa war to the death	147.3335

at the outer door the steward paused	150.9525
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle	180.3491
who has paid me this attention my mistress sir	138.8973
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another	198.3591
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and dartagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning	100.4014

porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn dartagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye	62.4658
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in	65.6643
meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to	153.4672

penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his masters daughter mademoiselle julie and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault	98.0335
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said dartagnan to the youth	69.8328
and pray what was this quarrel about these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose to do her violence without doubt said athos	113.0910

dartagnan saw that the moment was come	44.1104
no sir	36.6601
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil	245.5379
well he said to the lieutenant	21.9765
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention	244.7302
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	254.4458
a high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passersby	84.6809
i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become	175.2422
one of his rivals attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernandhe was ghastly pale	393.3675

edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto	175.7857
yes monsieur replied dartagnan here it is ah ah it is quite regular and explicit said the governor	85.1519
thank you said luigi drawing back his hand i render a service i do not sell it well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift ah yes that is another thing then said the traveller take	87.2008
these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between albano and civitacastellana i accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins	130.4482
for a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre what is your name inquired the traveller	199.8281
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass	147.1201
dartagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it	123.8944
besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	99.6001

in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love	72.5534
dartagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion	137.7316
not at all my young man	32.8801

de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on paradehe stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the	122.4061
king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday eveningdo you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers after a moments silence no sir we do not but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow	84.6638
de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation albert turned	79.2014
the cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said you are monsieur dartagnan i am that individual replied the officer	84.1997
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan	77.2658
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach	63.5635
and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued dartagnan	120.1313

my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each others failings	76.5098

they are beating the general alarm the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	132.7526
as i told you it is an old family jewel and yousold it asked dartagnan hesitatingly	97.4619
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged	57.7367
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor	146.4942
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of courseof course said the prisonersanyone can see hes a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade m	171.8846
i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper	122.9746
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_	187.2141
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again never see you again exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julies cheeks never behold you again	176.8645
from that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard	109.4171
both entered and found themselves in darkness but mme	116.4741
about eleven oclock in the morning they perceived amiens and at half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn	53.4224
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera	187.8527

supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his fathers honor _ma foi_ we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you	92.7187
undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject	154.3867
from whom from haydée why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affairwhat can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that	127.2989
i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i domost decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go	113.1412
to beauchampvisit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so	145.3555
impossible cried milady	132.4517
our readers already know how he was recognized by dartagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey	169.5345
no i am lost do not be lost with me	34.3417
they were very happy	50.9767
i will now go up into my apartment	66.0126
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint	68.2798
de villefort felt no effects	175.9259
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to dartagnan who pressed it respectfully	39.4707
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak	48.1354
impossible the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently	353.6375
then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a sigh	44.3921
the king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust	125.0053
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend	75.1065
dartagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before	86.4980
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity	205.5555
it is to be tomorrow said aramis hastily	97.5034
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried felton	203.7996
that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance m the englishman smiled imperceptibly	124.3524
but raoul said aramis	91.6004
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark	147.9024
bonacieux therefore ask my own secrets and i will reveal them to you but those of othersthat is quite another thing very well said dartagnan i shall discover them as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become mine beware of what you do cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make dartagnan start	97.1142
in spite of himself	37.3907
several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away from her	102.5145
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazelnut la carcontes eyes sparkled with cupidity and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it yes your excellency	65.0186
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner	74.4541
a little better sir will you drink some of this ether and water i will try but dont touch me why not because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return drink barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him	126.7048
oh my former friends my former friends he murmured and fell with his face to the ground	91.3083
come laporte said the queen	34.6591
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not	62.4180
the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance	112.0841
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that dartagnan himself could hardly recognize him	168.1130
you are of my opinion are you not viscount	86.1809
these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation	1246.9313
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point	250.5146
just then the sound of fingernails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edwards room valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated	95.6523
the lock turned and the door slowly opened	81.0200
morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance	204.8035
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m	28.9935
dartagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her offfor i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance ah said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that and my wife on her part has sworn to	80.5311

i paused but i had already drunk half a glass	106.0416
that happened which m	187.8767
oh how happy you make us no doubt you come to join the princes as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud	154.3356
and what did he say to you asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo	114.2369
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	112.3502
in which m	116.1469
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire	73.6165

ah yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine kings cockatoo you shall see and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor broussel is being arrested help sir said comminges	167.0102
declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king i obey i obey sir cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority	155.8970
you alarm me	219.0624
dartagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly	114.9706

that miladys son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already the devil he is said porthos	77.6593
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me	13.4888
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos	148.0267
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again	117.5766
he had passed the night standing and without sleep	98.0582
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with dartagnan when he was on duty	87.8100
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman was my mother the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard	97.7073
de tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret affair	69.6053
andrea made no resistance although he protested against it	153.6155
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together _ma foi_ said maximilian in consternation	90.1443
i have not forgotten all i owe thee	75.1477
well my dear friend said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours	112.9167
m	nan
mordaunt ah thought dartagnan the man i am warned against by athos ah thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition	185.8831
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his	128.1122
appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again	86.1192

mon dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog does he hate his majesty as much as he does us pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property true said aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your	171.5257
judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him	60.6773
what the devil captain one cannot win all ones battles the great pompey lost that of pharsalia and francis the first who was as i have heard say as good as other folks nevertheless lost the battle of pavia and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword said aramis for mine was broken	185.6883
at the first parry	55.2338
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and dartagnan	103.4725
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count	195.3372
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe	97.6516
i mean spinach replied aramis but on your account i will add some eggs and that is a serious infraction of the rulefor eggs are meat since they engender chickens this feast is not very succulent but never mind i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you i am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis but	127.3180
if your body be not greatly benefited by it be assured your soul will and so aramis you are decidedly going into the church	180.6228
answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so doing faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me we need only a week to amend all that	88.8541
you have an opportunity now count do not allow it to escape dartagnan became very pale he was wounded in his _self_love he thought that it was in his _love_	72.1413
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse	64.3951
dartagnans eyes sparkled with joy	17.7337

the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary m	203.3081
for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced	371.9762
because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance dantès smiled	209.7751
wretch exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off	75.2274
the child was born was given to memotionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention	156.5570
it was four oclock when dantès was placed in this chamber	46.4924
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself	194.7019
look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated roof very well said the gentleman	164.6415
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal	55.1021
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea	92.4145
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	76.8456
in that case let there be no more question of whats past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar	123.7218
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven oclock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood	75.7506

athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings	240.1310
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	122.9125

i wont have dantès killedi wont and who has said a word about killing him muddlehead replied danglars	338.7200
he passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback	85.7691
i mean to ask if you are married ah as to that no replied athos laughing	72.6866
i thank you dartagnan you are more impetuous than you were returned dartagnan	87.6917
danglars informed you of the ceremony oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned possibly my fatherinlaw trusted to its general notoriety well said monte cristo you are fortunate m	89.8203
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead	188.8665
the judge chapter	452.4978
you have only to wait here till i release you dartagnan was known to this valetdechambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal	78.7075
the chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it	32.9786
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing	29.8717
well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments ah _diable_ bells did you say what do you mean oh nothing i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night	154.2691
but it has been taken to the house at auteuil to that you went to you know yes i was saying to him only yesterday you are imprudent monsieur count for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected well said he what next well next some day you will be robbed what did he answer he	109.2899
quietly said what do i care if i am andrea he has some secretaire with a spring how do you know yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune	176.9090
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it	83.2613
might said villefort but that happiness was denied me	199.3937
in which m	116.1469
now this point was settled mme	372.8147
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	208.4426
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg name associated with the work	39.2085
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	129.3583
villefort became pale he understood the old mans meaning	78.9183
you have perhaps no money _perhaps_ is too much said dartagnan smiling	82.3418
well then said dartagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences	117.2553
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat	122.9502
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed	43.1064
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war	43.8891
his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiorityin fact the application of the axiom _pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you_ an axiom a	212.9020
hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of _knowing others_	260.2419
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	301.6158
all this i did scrupulously	381.4800
thank you sir thank you this is how you have lived during the last four nights valentine said the count	61.6810
dartagnan went to take leave of m	47.2996
the young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind and monsieur the duc dorleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union	221.6749
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be	326.8249
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest	32.0012
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	73.3821
at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles	172.1530
i have seen him that is he i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak the devil said athos musingly	83.3706
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace	154.9052
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companions words	56.8451
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume	80.2850
he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation	200.5861
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily i am not the	67.8339
queen	nan
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him	204.2511
the four friends were reunited	77.3224
no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty	140.2972
my orders asked grimaud	316.0941
yes milady replied athos the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit	72.6102
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong	81.5828
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another	109.7157
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and wit	94.6537
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened	106.1513
believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosoma heart devoted to youbelieve that you have been the idol of our lives that we have as you well knowgood heavenrisked our lives twenty times for your majesty	116.4164
de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of pèrelachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates	296.9597
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me	139.6511
just so replied aramis	135.3956
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	70.8467
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning	124.8960
well he shall live mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect themfar more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir	202.8255
goodnight friend and andrea after placing six pieces of five francs each in the mans hand leaped lightly on to the pathway	237.9023
mme	nan
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine oclock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m	60.9910
mother and son chapter	52.3707
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him	119.2263
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders	70.8141
as morrel and his son embraced on the pierhead in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face halfcovered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentrybox watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast	131.2017
done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds m and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hidingplace and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted jacopo jacopo jacopo then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed	457.3985
him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies	179.3705
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow	98.9911
monsieur dartagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity	84.1175
in the evening about nine oclock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his corridor	32.7611
not if it were my own brother cried dartagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm	93.2513
m	nan
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used up	70.4833
three months afterwards a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me away	145.1479
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent	106.1121
the hungry friends followed by their lackeys were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with for according to the advice of aramis it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity in order to reap a few in time of need	228.0856
yes sir and it was a fierce one his highness the prince charged eleven times in person he is a great commander bragelonne he is a hero sir	152.0819
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there	70.0221
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy	595.1747
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood	286.5518
he lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to heaven and recognized friquet	304.3749
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows	239.0941
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled	260.6684
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king	160.9725
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place	192.9771
why not said the musketeer	74.1756
laporte entered	224.0932
chapter xxiii	266.0772
the door was instantly opened and shut someone was taken in the mousetrap	111.5506
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character	36.9431
the next morning king charles i	195.8465
so let us go and get killed where we are told to go	59.1827
the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night	198.4963
at that letter the old man signified yes m repeated franz	155.1300
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	69.0918
the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation	253.4948
this pretended dartagnanwas he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into trévilles house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances	125.8506
horse said aramis with a grimace of disgust	58.6903
at the end of three months he had learned to read	22.8971
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised	131.3146
anne of austria deprived of the confidence of her husband pursued by the hatred of the cardinal who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling having before her eyes the example of the queenmother whom that hatred had tormented all her lifethough marie de médicis if the memoirs of the time are to be believed had begun by according	127.5719
to the cardinal that sentiment which anne of austria always refused himanne of austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her her most intimate confidants her dearest favorites	143.9839
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks where do you come from from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost	182.1309
what is to happen said porthos	40.7269
monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk muchmonsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar but where is athos now cried dartagnan	141.2175
according to the desire of your eminence i report to the convent of the carmelites at béthune where i will await your orders accordingly that same evening milady commenced her journey	84.4117
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	95.4715
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos	167.1417
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch	151.5534
over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins poisondeath exclaimed	224.8277
valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death	135.6270
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family	84.5732
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	23.0544
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services	57.6744
i am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so	362.8055
dartagnan knew what she wanted	102.3221
dartagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed	428.3607
i left it when i was but five years old replied haydée	90.2274
i send them but like pilatewashing my hands and what does mademoiselle darmilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil oh well i dont know but i understand that she is going to italy	97.4642
it arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws	396.9019
we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflectiona dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears	148.4496
besides his probity was irreproachable in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our era and the poor with gods seventh commandment	363.4199
i repeat it dartagnan you are the best one among us i bless and love you my dear son and to think that i couldnt find that out said porthos scratching his head it is so simple but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh athos shuddered and turned pale	100.8838
well then asked athos in a low tone	11.7406
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london and as to my other instructions asked the fair traveler	125.7622
dartagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them	156.7141
athos as a diplomatist	201.7523
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as i am that you have met with me for if i leave this place welli have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you oh when	166.1229
i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal	192.1897
de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you andrea blushed imperceptibly	77.8278
de trévilles as nine oclock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street door	120.2746
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if i am not dead i shall have seen you again madameeven if i have to overturn the world and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment	87.4402
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious	147.2727
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me	55.1843
felton named lord de winter the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known	140.2155
de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it	88.3351
what orders asked milady	304.0464
the result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody knows	125.2584
he turned	68.1929
yes yes and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured i will return the favor hereafter villefort shook his head	61.1212
beauchamp that you are more sober than he was sir said m	80.5465
where must we place him demanded the chief	152.4626
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfathers room but on the stairs she met m	56.7214
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive	161.6672
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	71.4960
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fishpond	406.2303
dartagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for	492.9844
and does he not live in the champsélysées yes no ah said caderousse no yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a gardenyou must know it possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior	113.3374
she will save us said conti	382.3780
all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise	111.7815
when they had advanced about twenty yards danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon	181.5766
i live because it is not ordained for me to die	68.3672
it was then that dartagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeersfor without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it	77.4060
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you and on what will you sleep said dartagnan	92.5839
no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m	61.4771
this gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use the cardinal referred to that man whom dartagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel	130.2065
the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobilitys boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the	221.1706
french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants	2956.3008
they spread their cloaks	174.1866
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the _pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor	158.5549
exactly replied mousqueton	238.7243
un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin it doesnt surprise me said dartagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take	175.6041
my carbine no dont be alarmed but where did you get all these details from a good source sir i heard it from friquet from friquet	186.9164
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all	65.5306
no my lord and i will set out at once	21.8296
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive dartagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but but what asked anne of austria	77.2230
valentine with her womans instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristos second and from the young mans wellknown courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him	114.9530
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of	127.4270
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage	36.6695
the judge we remember that the abbé busoni remained alone with noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girls body	66.5461
cavalcanti and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly what	120.7098
debray inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic life	106.1889
at ten oclock anne of austria had entered the kings room	18.9582
yes ali himself my nubian mute whom you saw i think at rome certainly said morcerf i recollect him perfectly	334.4478
de tréville on leaving the residence of the _lieutenantcriminel_ and the governor of fort levêque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace	41.6242
the baroness approached leaning on madame de villeforts arm	97.0184
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so	77.3181
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewherehave i not obeyed	253.5173
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families	192.3368
who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting	65.8497
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another	100.2777
and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company	55.5455
de villefort said renée becoming quite pale dont you see how you are frightening usand yet you laugh what would you have	99.1510
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for tonight and even for all day tomorrow if you want it	81.8309
as mademoiselle de scudery remarks scarron and raoul laughed	680.5593
two remained with the men in black who rummaged every place and took all the papers	169.5418
several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	109.2040
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped	34.0905
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head	62.1056
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court	98.0378
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince	39.3416
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by federal laws and your states laws	40.1598
monte cristo was more affectionate than everindeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all	73.9002
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself	111.8748
then you can let me have some money can you not whatever you say my dear count i am at your orders why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each otherfor such i presume is the case danglars bowed assentingly	120.0563
because replied dartagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest and you have been here since about a quarter of an hour said dartagnan motioning to porthos not to contradict him	66.7370
but said andrea illtemperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating	155.3390
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _pharaon_ and look carefully to the unloading of her freight	106.4318
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss	175.1607
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him	35.8844
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty	328.0219
you were you know how i settled the matter did he die i dont know	92.0559
here is what you are looking for he said	20.6024
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	101.3704
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	25.6008
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son	118.8670
a glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to raoul	442.9206
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how illformed are your objections to valentines marriage noirtier answered only by a look which made villeforts blood run cold	260.0219
there are four men come to arrest me	38.6284

well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society	42.5490
morrel whispered what have you done to him i	53.0192
the marquis de saintméran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii	67.1590
dartagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression	166.2633
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret	314.5680
_certes_ cried athos you are the bestmounted poet of france or navarre well my dear aramis you dont want three horses	106.4561
you see m	89.2230
she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not she was of a noble family of fiesole count and her name was do you desire to know her name oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it the count knows everything said the italian bowing	72.9733
no sir but i am severely what can we do said dartagnan we must return to paris i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again	89.2829
shall i knock hush replied dartagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window do you hear nothing whispered planchet	208.1634
only imagine what happiness that would afford me	147.7191
unlimited credit about two oclock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his	98.0422
eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his featuresa person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron	277.5632
and directed his groom to inquire at the porters lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within	106.5834
his bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again	257.3534
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention	132.2023
de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m	105.9932
dartagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word	96.0107
de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused	39.4490
de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them m at the moment when davrigny was returning to valentines room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m	169.6754
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	92.8290
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones	63.4883
where then could he be if he had entered his mothers room and not since returned	127.6016
they are mistaken bring him here at eight oclock sir and may heaven bless you as i bless you and now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us better my lord diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has	148.5945
offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you i offer you a beggar my lord ah ah said gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all	127.4596
france might hear it that it is mazarin who has reduced them to poverty exactly your man bravo and the man a plain and simple beggar as i have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of st eustache and you say that he has a	153.4975
great influence over his compeers are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything an association in which every one takes his share one that elects a leader yes i have heard it said replied the coadjutor	124.0814
chapter xix	204.7092
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in	113.2213
which that letter came into the house had placed on my guardi did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it	86.3540
seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet	95.9020
come let us talk a little about my father who then am i you siryou are my adopted father	224.0418
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime yes	61.2540
dartagnan rose and taking a letter from his writingdesk presented it to raoul	61.7444
i hastened to the innkeeper	136.6436
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them	65.2388
cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise darmilly her singing teacher	181.7841
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood	64.8068
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back	106.6490
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont neuf	60.7219
m to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure	168.9313
he had gone down about threequarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke	61.5222
sign my lord and he gave him a pen	32.7598
very well what did i say to you	15.6055
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house	199.1338
people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it porthos arrived a minute after dartagnan	128.3752
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his	178.7145
a short time ago while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m	177.3537
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily	71.8116
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from granite then he added aloud but you have relations left you i have one remaining	242.8031
we have already observed with what rapidity dartagnan seized the expression of a countenance	92.6647
dartagnan the elder an honor to which remember your ancient nobility gives you the rightsustain worthily your name of gentleman which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you	155.2970
you are deceived monsieur i know her very well ah said mme	84.6666
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine	343.7507
it is waiting for us at greenwich opposite the isle of dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights	133.8535
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte cristo	66.1434
halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines on on cried dartagnan therell be firing on they all set off swift as the wind	328.1184
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence	143.5217
not with us sir replied dantès	83.6005
set out for naples the hague or st petersburgcalm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hotheaded parisians	314.6730
now asked porthos what are we to do now we shall make use of your shoulder friend porthos if this door proves to be locked	78.7940
m you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort	67.2370
noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him valentine blushed but did not answer	119.5086
i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain	144.3779
on whom do my hopes rest	1398.1400
well tempter what more do you want with me said dartagnan	93.9767
stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms	125.6033
but then he may have stopped at saint germain i dont think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette i was there this very day and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling	101.4300
attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to dantès but dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months	119.3636
apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alone well be it so then	108.9072
what could be his intentions towards him	164.1254
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point	134.9028
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her	42.2853
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those	86.7423
who sleep wish fora happy awakening	29347.8867
will that do my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks well then said athos it is agreed	104.1264
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which dartagnan occupied with authority	86.8567
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and i well youthe cardinal would have given you letters of nobility did he tell you so yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise be satisfied replied bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet time the ninny murmured mme	179.9885
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom	134.0034
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night	71.0364
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of illwill towards me	91.9434
they would have found they have not found but they are on the track yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it	92.4501
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband but how could he have done so without your knowledge danglars since you are the ships supercargo why as for that i could only	206.0576
know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden	129.3622
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around	127.0757
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	93.6040
danglars gave francs for his horses very well	119.8155
how sometimes the unhappy mistake chance for providence	656.8492
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention	211.7019
de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant	57.0175
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel at the hotel of said porthos by my faithnor do i remember it either it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain alas sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things	121.1059
in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how is there a house in the neighborhood asked dartagnan	95.3758
as for the duc de beaufort he arrived from vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces	96.7375
how could i then return to brussels	61.5550
the visitor either understood the abbés meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the door	150.0088
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort	42.8833
besides germain was in the interests of the queen and if anything should happen mme	149.3395
freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms _to his eminence monseigneur the cardinal richelieu in his camp before la rochelle_	227.0830
sdeath cried he to the coachman	24.5121
the following sunday then the parisians arose with joy at that period a te deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect	128.4550
on her side but as softly as possible kitty turned the key of the lock and then dartagnan opened the closet door	84.7758
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalierthat she found this cavalierand that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of	83.9250
her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer	63.1761
yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that dartagnan did not perceive it	134.3918
chapter xliii	192.3047
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished two	410.1424
however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg website you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining	124.1932

i knew that said monte cristo she has been dead these ten years and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye	167.3354
finally farmer louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thirty	706.4751
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety	376.7217
then he is not dead m no you see plainly he is not dead	47.3256
i reached the age of twentynine without loving for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love	376.2910
de tréville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip	97.5273
here are five francs for his trouble indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark	143.0714
m	nan
de châteaurenaud exaggerates not worth speaking of cried châteaurenaud life is not worth speaking ofthat is rather too philosophical on my word morrel	362.2740
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late	26.3222
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain	129.2733
chapter	nan
do you wish for a notary asked villefort	33.1345
have you a heart	44.7468
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo	91.4486
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel	130.5939
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers	128.5233
i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods nor yet his wife that is a childs reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner	257.4522
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most wellmeaning	136.0880
monsieur de beaufort escaped my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace and you did not fire on him he was out of range monsieur de chavignywhere was he absent and la ramee was found locked up in the prisoners room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him but the man who was under him	80.4414
was an accomplice of the dukes and escaped along with him mazarin groaned	252.7161
who sent you come come you are going on quickly m	130.4094
dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea	197.5653
well do you not adopt this means athos said dartagnan	68.4797
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermens boats white and graceful as the seagull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain	243.4870
suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	217.2521
in addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal there might be reckoned in paris at that time more than two hundred smaller but still noteworthy levees	71.4331
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any	257.7169
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink	202.8389
i am a priest and confessions die in my breast	112.2370
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	34.0386
i shall wait for you here till seven the young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse	80.3584
that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable	245.5865
i as a philosopher should like a little countryhouse a cottage down there under the trees without so many freestones over my poor body	262.6421
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	165.0725
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim	91.7251
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and	146.1034
evident preoccupation aroused suspicions	15381.0879
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	37.7461
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the tablethe rarest of all luxuries in their complete formare well understood the suppertable was loaded with waxlights and flowers	206.5730
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	169.1542
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurators wife with a sigh	41.5385
dartagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarins anteroom	77.6930
you were writing i your fingers are stained with ink ah true i was writing	216.7961
bonacieux who was ignorant that dartagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m	113.1562
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble	80.8499
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos	95.9720
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me fie madame fie said porthos as if disgusted	83.0516
go on my child said the count in the romaic language	33.5277
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	172.0307
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number one	194.0132
i wish my life to be free and open	88.7423
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	138.7148
adieu thus tis quite decided said dartagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i repeat i am made up of contradictions	109.7925
dartagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart	84.2573
well now my dear gérard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me but my dear fellow replied m	39.2215
this announcement was received in silence	88.3900
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	126.8856
poor assunta had guessed all	291.7061
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent	56.5732
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes	61.9242
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry	59.9814
i have nothing to save for your majesty you are only the victim of perfidious plots that is true that is true my child said the queen you are right give me then that letter madame time presses the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and pens	85.5177
the prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken	75.4607
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your _affettatore_ who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be	105.6520
your fault do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied and now we understand each other when do you wish the carriage to be here in an hour in an hour it will be at the	90.0927
door an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival	83.8878
i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind without revealing himself he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart	111.9209
by the accents of julies voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist and do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired emmanuel	278.7287
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition	86.1655
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	182.2042
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan	148.2137
you at marseillesyes says he	544.9232
even his breathing seemed to be arrested	101.8641
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom i have no seconds on my part monsieur said dartagnan for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i	64.0842
was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends athos reflected for an instant	64.1291
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am	144.9065
bonacieux	nan
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet	251.9687
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay	37.3976
monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter	78.7821
as for aramis he went off to the bishops palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the kings presence	67.4975
once out of auteuil andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity let me ask you why you deceived me how have i deceived you how do you ask	103.1738
we must not do so no you do not sanction our project no there is another way said morrel	119.3353
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone	234.2829
who was the invisible chief	305.8801
is she going to fall in love with me by chance this fair inconstant and will she be disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me for de wardes dartagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to miladys	165.0087
de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv	100.9484
he waited then in the antechamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them	63.3813
you and how by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring	209.1647
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word	54.9469
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king	135.0786
chapter lxviii	220.7136
but it is beginning again i say well said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at maximilian let it begin againit is like the house of the atreidae god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment	114.7509
ah my friend said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls	180.3728
and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form	256.5754
one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me	260.1904
do you not see that i reserve eighty francs for myself	45.3464

a sign to guitant to follow him	51.3078
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him he knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer	84.7718

she knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone	74.0566
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthoss horse and that of dartagnan	122.6633
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no	46.1900
sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit	133.2895
his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	166.9346
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	241.7014

you will soon know but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent	165.9862
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head	65.6291
the two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen	58.1201
on the landing dartagnan blushed in the antechamber he trembled	83.8004
the breakfastroom was finished in oak the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask	182.4230
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed	166.2765

a lady it was said had just fainted they had supplied her with a smellingbottle and she had recovered	95.6242

the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question	61.7285
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post	90.7188
yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it we have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness	72.4393
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the dust	52.1230
come there cannot be too many m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m	54.7950
the history of athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong	116.9897
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time	136.2410
he knew that there was a trapdoor communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard	92.0271
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was dartagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you thank god thank god yes it is i said dartagnan it is i whom god has sent to	60.1107
watch over you was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy	112.9742
noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied davrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs study	205.1811
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of livres	85.1107

the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself	156.6048
unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugénie had not taken place not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also	151.7593
set her at liberty	210.0298
i quit the world then i make a sacrifice	114.0321

then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress	182.5885
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	111.9672

ah excuse me then said dartagnan	30.1963
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his selflove immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	245.2953

mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers	121.7949
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de	117.7379

the man was m	108.0163
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak	26.4603
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard dartagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should	133.0939
be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal	275.9669
mazarin replied dartagnan bursting into a laugh	130.2623
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of dartagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away no replied	196.1456
dartagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour	181.5952
well said he in a low voice	6.4750
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly	104.2044
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present	265.5157
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos	49.4051

let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you	31.8523
mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds passreflections like thoughts of the heavens	166.7206
on seeing him dartagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	86.6279
de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus	76.3907
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court	140.7193
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	220.6844
sir my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you i make a hasty resolution said morrel shrugging his shoulders is there anything extraordinary in a journey m maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed	89.4643
cries of despair resounded on all sides	114.9320
he was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the saintlazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness	104.1809
villefort approached noirtier	201.8862
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo	70.9771
dartagnan was a physiognomist	107.0557
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her	141.6162
franz dépinayi am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villeforts absenceand will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me noirtiers look continued to interrogate	205.3160
as to porthosoh as to porthos faith thats a droll affair and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passersby offended no one	163.0515
my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord beware all england is tired of your iniquities my lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped my lord you are held in horror by god and men	123.6659
de tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window well monsieur continued he you say it is his eminences guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers yes sire as they always do and how did the thing happen	101.6914
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists	319.8495
she drew her husband to the door	26.2944
because i am too young to die the woman you poisoned at béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said dartagnan	95.5534
if he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy let us go then	103.4938
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf	129.3713
i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz yesyesterday what did he tell you that he was leaving at the same time as his letter well now then the count the count will come of that you may be satisfied you know that he has another name besides monte cristo no i did not know it	43.4444
monte cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name i never heard it well then i am better informed than you his name is zaccone it is possible he is a maltese that is also possible	50.6374
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept	37.4485
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which edmond had concealed from all others	211.6700
as for the count he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food	129.2256
a man whose name is franz dépinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda no he is a man about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a	193.5589
knittingneedle but he paid your ransom he said two words to the chief and i was free and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp	91.5369
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie	199.2731
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection	359.3752
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible	72.4079
i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant and that is the very thing that alarms me returned dantès	93.9052
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	223.2099
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything	138.3028
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world	40.2322
dartagnan then looked around attentively	81.7808
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me	147.7860
stop stop cried dartagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men	374.2739
i will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent i read the note and sat up to await you and he will be guillotined will he not said caderousse	123.4280
chapter xvi	136.7036
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of	73.5739
being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother	159.5796
go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the gardenhedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i	223.7588
had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence	78.4550
anybody may possess a fivefranc piece but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me	122.0618
pardon my lord said felton stopping the duke but does your grace know that the name of charlotte backson is not the true name of this young woman yes sir i know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink	61.3814
the fair indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down and resumed her air of naivete	378.0508
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it offin small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed	154.2424
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	93.5936
athos pinched aramiss hand	574.3563
see him and hear what he says m	75.1084
athos recognized grimaud	354.1604
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty	108.5690
now gentlemen said dartagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs	60.9088
i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow	75.0157
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankardit was full of gunpowder	235.3829
dartagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life	107.2812
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those farfamed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale	83.3859
lake maggiore	1086.7950
fifty vessels were waiting to set out	70.5878
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury do then as i did my lord	60.5395
the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden	163.3380
i will retire madame	254.2429
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel	55.6240
he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned	48.8579
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body was that i saw that i heard	130.2147
as for me i shall be deceived all my life perhaps but i shall always have faith in a person whose countenance inspires me with sympathy you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses permit	137.9570
me madame to express my surprise said the abbess	133.0318
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head	199.5148
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance	115.7782
you can sleep here yes do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you no i must sleep at beaucaire	115.9561
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied dartagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me	129.7458
with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn	59.2400
this dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of industry	130.5286
what does the animal say asked the duke	56.4902
but what are you looking for i am looking for the person who let down the ladder	49.3222
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos he can he says only swim in rivers when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere	249.0463
oh maximilian how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it	104.3314
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m	64.4888
thats what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio	118.8460
poor concino concini and yet he but desired the good of the people yes my lord like yourself said the queen ironically	179.0204
count said he i thank you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer but i must return to paris what has happened a great misfortune more important to me than life	76.5640
finally he promised that he would leave her mistresss presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid	100.3053
touches upon the strange effects a halfpistole may have	132.3292
why of downright starvation starvation exclaimed the abbé springing from his seat	250.9925
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself hear me count replied dartagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts i wish for nothing more	150.8096
have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur dherblay	98.1772
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss	74.3797
absent kings are very soon forgotten if he passes over into france his cause is lost but persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart send him help of men and money for i can do nothing for him i have sold even to my last diamond to aid him	206.3898
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	69.8524
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed why we must inquire into that was caderousses reply and turning towards the young man said well catalan cant you make up your mind fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses	254.2852
and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body	1857.8372
impossible that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret well what is to be done if monsieur chevalier would follow me said kitty timidly	88.3619
compared with such things what is the letter you have just reada lovers deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her	136.4416
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	92.7284
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features	116.3355
i was speaking of your fathers past history	130.7408
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home be easy	303.7721
what did you answer him that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see well what did he say then that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and	44.3838
that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview the snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal replied the young man smiling	97.5540
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by châteaurenaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel	65.3440
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it	146.4334
de boville the inspector of prisons no rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with	160.9049
a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned	823.0697
the standard very well in half an hour we shall be on board and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england what do you say of that young man asked dartagnan as they hurried along	69.8739
you are a christian you are my sister in religion	69.0939
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom	104.7343
the duke however was not dead	68.1653
davrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind	231.4776
but you expected some one then asked the officer	88.9210
de morcerf ah you are acquainted with the young viscount are you we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome true true cried danglars	104.8649
it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the sailor unknown you say is the man who rendered you this serviceunknown to you yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian	143.5928
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort	85.1043
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you	110.5795
well i was a million in advance with him and now my fine jacopo manfredi suspends payment really it is an unheardof fatality	278.6268
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the kings musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have	102.4705
not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain	82.0244
dartagnan returned and again attacked him	124.7022
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said hegood good you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of sanfelices daughter	195.3259
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate	140.8557
m	nan
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes	405.1291
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more	96.0787
certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waistgirdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain	195.3865
these steps came on came fast	787.3663
i waited for him until this hour replied franz	96.5155
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii	102.2902
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last i dont know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord	53.6546
the anjou wine chapter xliii	1047.5809
monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know this is but a	77.8930
trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent	190.2613
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through	107.2547
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or	115.0870
to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust	145.7472
the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply	75.6112
our bestborn and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able to obtain it	204.7147
in the name of heaven cried he listen to me i have been waiting for someone who has not come	22.2251
but wait	750.4709
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can	120.2044
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down	68.9507
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected	156.5773
devil take it he muttered to himself dont let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them well then said athos what are your schemes	96.7859
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lostthirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london	171.0459
certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardians hand and i can set out immediately when you like raoul sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me	75.8381
and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince and you ought to thank her raoul	90.0904
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	65.5925
not yet replied porthos	62.3852
bonacieux sorrowfully	3431.7192
conscience what hast thou to do with me as sterne said	169.4384
anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de condé who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil in whatsoever direction it might be	95.0058
ah my worthy gentlemen cried i what do you want you must have a ladder said he who appeared to be the leader of the party	58.1054
why should they	80.5034
certainly	nan
you shall be my bodyguard	150.3546
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m	165.7388
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service that may be true replied porthos but i am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much oh blind selflove thought dartagnan	105.0854
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of dartagnan and porthos in their hands	42.2500
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine	93.6026
a young man does not require luxuries besides i know what travelling is with a postchaise and valet de chambre any way mother well be it so	262.6303
de villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward	132.1147
for i think you told me it was a boy m	46.6140
the son of a shipowner really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish a mineral watercure at auteuil well im sure said morcerf this is indeed news am i allowed to repeat it yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and	237.7693
do not say i told you why so because it is a secret just discovered by whom the police then the news originated at the prefects last night	117.9864
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	51.2937
how have you spent this francsit is no business of mine when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience	110.7307
as to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary	90.1164
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor	69.6491
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air	115.8204
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at mens faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind	129.2606
read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe	77.3530
dartagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error	36.4027
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles	74.0561
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do	62.7428
in july we added francsit was you know the month of the spanish bonds	341.8233
is it not a halt in deaths anteroom m i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray	363.4592
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment chapter xxxix	386.6694
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking over public affairs	99.8497
i comprehend now you comprehend said porthos	280.3859
de tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation	89.3576
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried	143.5486
a nurse of the doctors choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven oclock when valentine was asleep	225.2199
de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	30.1093
what is your sister valentine doing inquired madame de villefort of edward tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count you have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young i presume the daughter of m	66.0357
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void yes said villefort but i warn m	190.2461
just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon	133.0435
what did your excellency say inquired the other	74.1852
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals	335.8668
yes shall i call him yes valentine went to the door and called barrois	68.8267
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her	123.0753
do not lie my angel said dartagnan smiling that would be useless what do you mean	52.2984
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms	90.8388
bonacieux	nan
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday evening he turned towards porthos and aramis	198.8131
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold	74.6817
that can only be to hold gloves he said	201.4755
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten	394.5070
well said he do you still doubt oh murmured the young girl	31.8226
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairson the expulsion of don carlos	292.0782
all have forgiven me some have even loved me but i think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that womans ghost rising before me a woman you have assassinated a woman then cried the monk	121.0616
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either	87.6998
a bullet or a knife poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of itself my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	68.4162
hold theres a carriage coming over yonder then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name thats right	336.8581
what an injustice my dear invalid i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say	135.0233
you know me well enough we no longer know anyone madame you must be mad my friend said the baroness	60.7149
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and dartagnan a captain	72.4041
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders	72.8595
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	90.7697
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired	140.1265
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns	104.9658
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan	60.6402
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket	82.6712
during the day i had nothing to fear	27.7002
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons but i love her my lord and was jealous	83.7476
isnt mousqueton there but he wears my livery my livery will be known replied porthos	236.2369
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried	150.5227
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamps anger was beginning to riseyou have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to	97.9882
forget that i ever bore that title	119.0261
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was dartagnans mount	500.4370
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit	77.8679
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company cant do without me there my leave is at an end do you return to paris asked athos quickly	139.3845
their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant	247.2727
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man	49.5649
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him	116.7674
at four oclock dartagnan recommenced his journey	104.5503
now said dartagnan you wouldnt be sorry to understand the plot would you porthos well no not very well then we shall go down into the court yes we shall take the place of those two fellows well we will walk back and forth thats a good idea for it isnt warm in a moment the valetdechambre will call the guard as he	88.0374
did yesterday and the day before and we shall answer no on the contrary we shall not answer as you please i dont insist on answering we will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence where shall we escort him where he is goingto visit athos	104.2743
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	86.4264
as dartagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to porthos and as he was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends he held out his hand to the wounded man and told him he was about to resume his route in order to continue his researches	36.6387
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands	92.6115
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention	144.2089
well that has happened friend porthos	191.8186
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival	70.8686
speak command i will obey morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening	157.6763
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine the count smiled	89.7142
come come continued the count i see you are still the samean assassin reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not iit was la carconte that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there no reverend sir i have	99.3305
been liberated by someone that someone has done society a great kindness ah said caderousse i had promised and you are breaking your promise interrupted monte cristo	125.3855
adieu dear sister till your next swoon this was all that milady could endure	269.8457
he can turn his coat inside out you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice dartagnan smiled	117.0399
dartagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarkedfor nothing had led him to the examinationthat the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses	203.2356
she who mistaking you for the cardinals guards has just fled away your companion cried dartagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress	109.7623
who made the lemonade i did did you bring it to your master directly it was made no you left it somewhere then in the meantime yes i left it in the pantry because i was called away who brought it into this room then mademoiselle valentine davrigny struck his forehead with his hand	122.1410
quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight oclock precisely very good replied albert that is all i wished to know then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow	104.3386
why did you leave the closet monsieur dartagnan asked the cardinal	37.6591
well after all said dartagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such	97.2718
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon	132.3391
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh	79.5778
opposite the tower of london he found the vessel that had been named to him delivered his letter to the captain who after having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate preparations to sail	85.5522
chapter lxxxviii	239.6846
albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments	107.9440
these gentlemen are with me said winter	65.4856
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesemmanuel herbaut monte cristo smiled imperceptibly	316.3479
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done	108.3991
morrel	nan
on leaving the paternal chamber the young man found his mother who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment	111.9893
come come said dartagnan more reason why we should start on our journey	62.8155
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman	90.6720
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	315.2885
certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real innocence	73.8656
you always say _trifles_ my dear athos said dartagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never loved the drinkdeadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as before	151.5004
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet	77.4820
my lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncles saddlebow	141.4708
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out	66.6456
yes but in my soul much more than in my body we will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of bethune as these people say that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claimthat is to say	72.1663
i was but am no longer it is fifteen years since i gave up the office	63.8682
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	118.1680
the abbé the abbé murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering	188.8605
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers	44.6548
defend yourself one minute said the young man	20.5221
at four oclock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived	69.2655
halfpast one only said he	88.6293
de tréville grasped the situation	146.9461
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england what is your name then asked mazarin	47.1778
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the _impresari_ i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me	121.4381
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing	394.9250
it was aramis who broke the silence	109.0904
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when dartagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal	70.3389
this door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector	74.4698
the house of morrel son chapter	146.6428
our recruits from béarn are not generally very rich and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province	146.4472
in that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of god rich happy caderousse smiled bitterly	102.2339
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead	52.5056
will you examine them oh m	85.1969
it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners but they believe i am shut up alone here that makes no difference and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here i do that is about the distance	167.8951
that separates your chamber from mine only unfortunately i did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet i made it fifty	271.5414
was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree	104.0394
changing him	290.6512
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school	160.2179
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat	1561.8649

the note is changed	409.2654
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated	287.0654
the president again arose and having imposed silence saidsir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimedif you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its	150.9785

although weakened the young mans brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss	114.9125
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	115.3723
sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss	199.8848
it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure	118.7255

what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased	173.4656
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort	62.5683

one only needs to be sharp thats all	331.1902
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself	111.7801
in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	199.1087

numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever dartagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect	165.5054

if you can my dear dartagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris then said aramis this falls out very well he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty	66.9234

in an instant dartagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes	77.5401

i shall replied dartagnan and instantly in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascons hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it and athos bowed to dartagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would	133.6103
not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts	48.5958
i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man but leave us i pray you the baron went out sobbing	113.4886

no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii and i will adhere to it these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of	92.9729

milady recognized his step	386.1573
noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing	80.8440

but when the cardinal added that not only mme	133.7185

dartagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake	110.0762
you are crazy	182.2758
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress	196.2886

i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	166.6064
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been childs play	203.9979
médéah was standing at the rack eating his hay	200.9950

the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal	96.8203
i would rather do so was edmonds reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed	309.9184
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the	111.0246
rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host goodnight and mounted the stairs	441.1071
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story	49.4895
no certainly not and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him	113.4599
in the first place you will sup with me will you not asked aramis	39.9384
this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hidingplace and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flowergarden which by the light of the moon	104.8439
resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orangetrees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance	85.3972

father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugénie danglars and m	147.8091
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan	179.1952
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen	123.9011
let me see	12.3837
on leaving the chamber danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry reentered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champsélysées no	163.8366
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets	180.3569
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	162.8171
theres luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced touch it not grimaud he cried grimaud what art thou about	173.9867
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert	107.2274
this is the second time that monsieur dartagnan has been in england	24.7718
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect	156.3942

no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her	121.8229
de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family	71.8297
ah is it you dantès cried the man in the skiff	64.9146
we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere	147.4062
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel	135.5080
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	52.8242
besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france	75.4503
gentlemen said athos a wager ah _wooi_ a vager cried the swiss	152.3489
i was about to give it when you anticipated me that then is your opinion asked aramis	77.6654
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable	343.8005
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might you are perfectly right my lord you think so	124.6513
he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom	103.5479
it was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been gained but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him	148.2055
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable	435.8471
chapter lxiv	82.4866
cavalcanti i do not know him viscount you do not know him no i never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him but you receive him at your house that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbé who may be deceived	48.4061
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken	69.0125
but pardon me are you free	157.9124
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	212.2272
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness	72.9524
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away	196.8797

the idea of asking how i hear the news he said	112.1294
it is for you replied a gendarme	74.6718
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep	149.6631
when one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos	70.4381
he gallantly offered the righthand seat to beppo and sat by him	328.6221
villefort understood the kings intent	391.2982
what were you doing in the battle my friend inquired athos of the youth twas not your right place i think as you were not equipped for an engagement i had no intention of fighting today sir i was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for rueil when seeing monsieur de chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed	151.8302
me to charge at his side	212.0686
porthos was the first who came to himself	39.3482
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet	203.0068
in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this	259.7859
moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	115.9911
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment still my lord i cant travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and i cant travel on my savings for in my twentytwo years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts mazarin	195.2044
remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to dartagnan take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey if these are spanish doubloons or	144.3944
even gold crowns thought dartagnan we shall yet be able to do business together he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket	156.8427
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos	127.2456
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead	82.8900
i am young and strong i believe i am courageous and since yesterday i have learned the power of will	63.7170
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles	92.8511
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rentas i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux replied dartagnan trust me i am fully grateful	81.9081
for such unparalleled conduct and if as i told you i can be of any service to you i believe you monsieur i believe you and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you finish then what you were about to say the citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to dartagnan	58.3843
it may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his eminence with respect to him	62.7091
ah my yellow horse cried he	180.6748
the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row	77.1299

many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations	178.1581
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way	63.1486
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us francs for it	61.3010

luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes	213.7964
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other	118.0860
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmothers room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m	77.4244

this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said davrigny	114.7997
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride	104.9637
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm	139.4973
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man	82.1747
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	100.2713
what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects that is to say i visit an englishwomanthe one i named oh ay the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to adopt	132.1013

de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king	55.3884

milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the comte de rochefortthe demoniacal tool of his eminence	60.2532
aramis suffering at once in body and mind had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him that is to say the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder	104.4886
with such a _vade mecum_ dartagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait	292.4849

first which you proposed but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is	69.6105

you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing that too is impossible what a singular being you areyou will not interfere in anything you are rightthat is the principle on which i wish to act we will say no more about it then	165.4429
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities	238.9419
on guard but said he whom dartagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the préauxclercs what you say is full of sense replied dartagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely	126.4389
everyone therefore ran to the court some to witness the sight others to comment upon it	253.6022
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling	108.5031
on him the servant bowed and retired	133.6472
diplomat or not i dont know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to	109.6722
sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly	85.2370

the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely	180.7569
oh youll know it someday aramis but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctors niece aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening	187.4929
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven	68.6570
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting itof killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera	228.8959
one day as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre he was coming out as she was going in and she showed him to me the devil the devil murmured dartagnan all this is vague enough	70.7798
he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared	42.1823
the king made his entrance into paris on the twentythird of december of the same year	106.4230
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos	71.1560
still he had not even uttered a sigh	43.7796
suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughters voice	97.8446
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of dartagnan cruelly mystified him	86.0765
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance	184.8839
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good treat me in the same way	123.5053
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight and what are your feelings said monte cristo turning to the young man	53.7854
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders	201.5060
i am a brute	62.4631
each one went out by the open doors	97.3760
i will go to the queen and louis xiii opening the door of communication passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria	47.9016
these gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water theyve allowed him to walk over the border dartagnan began to smile	119.3844
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts	166.8382
there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi were the following lines which i can never forget the great wars of romagna had ended cæsar borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all italy	218.5418

ah monsieur said she you have saved me permit me to thank you madame said dartagnan i have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place you owe me no thanks oh yes monsieur oh yes and i hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate	47.3401
he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs	57.4926
one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body	148.9367
among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance	48.0106
of intrigues and secrets of state continued dartagnan complying with the recommendation	278.4285
the pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughters name	257.4973
they were both aroused at seven oclock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for dartagnan	77.0645
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton	44.6429
have you not thought so yes said monte cristo for that reason i wished to keep you near me it is miraculous continued morrel answering his own thoughts	73.2601
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone	44.6278
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin just like the women replied dartagnan coolly	307.4305
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him	172.7659
amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos	186.3456
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow	153.2196
ah madame said comminges hastening to dartagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector	67.7019
he began by asking m	339.9510
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident	662.0025
yes madame well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes i am sorry to say i cannot replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert are you very anxious to know countess asked albert	135.6501
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing hush said athos we are overheard in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been	102.4624
by chance he stood so still	227.5529
andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand	81.1422
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering	191.6550
of these francs you took crowns	448.3489
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france	84.2711
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelleenserval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	108.5591
he wore a vest of garnetcolored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridgebox worked with gold and red and green silk skyblue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two	220.2459
watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt	82.2038
so that thanks to her friends generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the bestattired peasant near rome	200.3225
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine oclock galloped into the yard of trévilles hôtel	73.5410
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him	57.2747
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips	71.9958
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of _la jeune amélie_ the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs	162.2332
they set out passing over the pont neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called labreuvoir pepin and went along by the walls of the grand chatelet	97.0088
on the contrary i think they are poor sir they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more i will give them to you i will not even ask	69.8002
who they are do as you like with them thank you sir exclaimed mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general	105.4840
who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it	86.0267
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels	156.4112
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven oclock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve well said villefort what then madame de villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir where to to the palais what to do my mistress wishes much to be present	101.0736
at the trial ah said villefort with a startling accent does she wish that the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails	74.7505
the dinner chapter	339.9512
soonstrange factaramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely	426.1890
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	114.6578
instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it	208.3324
keep watch from seven to nine	833.2770
in an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back	95.8829
now hastily interrupted the jesuit on seeing that his acolyte was going astray now your thesis would please the ladies it would have the success of one of monsieur patrus pleadings please god cried aramis transported	311.9121
good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting no said athos	94.9078
oh if so punish me as you will but do notdo not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained haydée replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free free to do what asked the young girl	71.9698
at châlons i was put upon the saône thence i passed on to the rhône whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles	176.0535
what a question now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied châteaurenaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile	101.1057
the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg sainthonoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchengarden of about an acre	164.3853
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbés chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon	124.7270
beside the sick mans couch	241.7921
fontrailles his aidedecamp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain	133.5939
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men	290.9515
you are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered	132.9723
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell	23.1345
it was one of the results of mazarins niggardliness	67.6699
albert attributed to franzs absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask	304.9760
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet	122.3255
the position in which he had left him was critical	78.7559
my god i know that i suffer thats all	59.7239
towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached	197.9219
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips	200.7632
why did he kill himself instead of you	53.5864
as i told you my dear morrel m	38.3364
these two gentlemen shall decide between us but first i will state the case to them	172.9397
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him	28.2297
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity wasnt his name faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor	192.1682
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that halfsmile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face	126.5037
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	72.6407
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles what can i do	179.5643
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood	56.6235
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau _purveyor of the musketeers_ thats all well cried dartagnan	321.3018
you would have done what i did mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength	105.6331
then take pistols with thee and a huntingknife are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy	194.3474
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward	232.7593
there is one comfort we are all in cash said dartagnan	85.2609
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonias	64.7631
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twentyfive and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	243.1289
only that there may be no delay i shall borrow one of your horses certainly all the four are at your service oh i need only one of them for the time being shall we take our valets yes you may as well take mousqueton	110.2005
all his funds amounted to or francs his bills receivable up to the th to or which making the best of everything gave him francs to meet debts amounting to francs	271.7853
peace with the landlord in addition to athoss old horse cost six pistoles	248.7620
bertuccio	nan
monsieur dartagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach m	181.3486
i will call for them today no tomorrow i shall not have time today well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil may i depend on it certainly because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it now see here will that be all	106.1645
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens albert approached	448.9901
it was the same through which twentyfour years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed	163.1064
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter	140.3343
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt and he threw the money into the river	91.7404
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not unskilled in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission	136.2788
but would you believe it he was not receiving so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty	164.5586
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on	253.3071
meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly alas resistance was far from my thoughts	153.4521
he made a great start and looked at me	72.1393
at his announcement dartagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones	110.5113
dartagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge	63.5604
impostor indeedm	27663.8125
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	136.5644
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest ah indeedmad repeated monte cristo and what was his mania he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him	76.8805
and the firmament	836.9011
dead animosities	725.0162
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmiths pincers the soldiers throat	469.0678
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron	62.4961
do you mean at rome i do ah then i suppose you heard haydées guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie	267.0259
what then would be the use of all i have suffered	45.5237
there came in moreover two drafts which m	458.6154
if i stay in paris i cannot go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur dartagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates	91.9344
to the voyage to rome and monseigneurs resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin	143.6387
darling replied valentine has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words _wait and hope_ fac et spera footnotes the wicked are great drinkers of water as the flood proved once for all in	247.2376
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the fatherinlaw i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn	57.9959
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee truly honor luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i	128.6147
dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest	56.2904
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning	141.5721
a procurators dinner however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurators wife	172.8294
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor	100.6395
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each	137.9055
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal	58.1956
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris	55.1720
and that other gentleman	285.7892
well now shall i tell you something added athos coolly	87.9888
pray was not monsieur dartagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude toguitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak outi know nothing but what the public knows	142.4282
am i to be captured he cried no not if i can use more activity than my enemies	171.4088
yes i will accompany you but did you not read that i must be alone said julie	37.2355
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom	101.3979
did he speak in your hearing	157.8497
many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view	146.1843
proceed was heard on all sides	255.2499
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife	139.9294
excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of m	109.3941
benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains	215.8913
dear maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line o mathilde idole de mon âme i was the first to discover duprez at naples and the first to applaud him	289.9270
dying in the arms of his children he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two years	42.8748
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery	101.7842
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for dartagnan to follow him	58.1083
they set out	23.1252
the duke porthos and dartagnan roared out both at once	189.0641
what is that news asked dartagnan	27.1414
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again	146.2029
leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible	123.2712
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and dartagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	271.2145
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of dartagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever	71.1935
at last their hilarity calmed down and faith exclaimed dartagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin for i assure you on his side he wishes you no good pooh really asked athos	186.2443
what are we to do maltese asked the captain	61.0743
dartagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais what then the bodies were not plundered were they	164.7636
progress of cavalcanti the younger chapter	231.2675
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demigod has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a	56.3141
ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man	135.7879
nevertheless it was necessary to finish	18.8446
there goes one cried athos at the end of five hundred paces	39.8630
athos porthos aramis the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance and who answered to the last of these three names immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part and advanced toward the cabinet the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered	70.6285
so now i have told my secret a telegraph repeated madame de villefort	78.6813
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m	34.0063
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon ah my dear m	72.5401
let us get down count and examine this rock they both alighted	139.3200
as the day advanced the tumult became greater	496.3930
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself	69.1546
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo	81.1152
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddlebags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the	92.5774
obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes	79.9691
m	nan
bonacieuxs	nan
de chevreuse	93.3922

well said andreamy servants coat and my hat ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do you	155.5632
the devil take you said aramis	60.5807
ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the château dif but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume	175.6974
as to dartagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black	49.6065
most likely said dartagnan i am one of his most faithful servants it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes a certain dartagnan a béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london do you know him personally asked the governor	91.5018
come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit capital this evening with you tomorrow at stuarts the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said dartagnan	127.7251
it is not aramis cried he	57.6792
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos	53.3246
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it	51.7415
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said villefort	126.0169

coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks	438.7819
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both	100.9500
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given	101.5286
have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival	159.8502
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart	85.3298
caderousse quickly performed the strangers bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off the name of edmonds betrothed was mercédès to be sure	217.2845

what do i see that he wouldnt swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldnt swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers	98.5537
thanks replied the jeweller	45.7498
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children rest assured put the gag in grimaud in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate	161.4834
but pardon said dartagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing mordaunt stopped short	189.3675
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos	88.2115
and that you should fail me dartagnan passed a very bad night	126.0531
do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abbé	65.0844

albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe	91.2996
the shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence	88.4190
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydée your sisterlet her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the counts voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo	135.1845
turned around haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement	66.4952
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing	92.0008
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally	74.5289
gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult	102.4842
ah you frighten me	44.7399
dont you see them cried friquet dont you see	56.2436
why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny	195.6348
oh yes that is well and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket	105.8155
fire cried grimaud unconsciously	370.8472
and has visited with me that is in	92.3053
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemmathe one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold	344.2976
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress	103.7586
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune	44.2490
the jailer advanced dantès appeared not to perceive him	176.9721
mazarin turned again to his papers	79.5618
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him	120.9784
a _fleurdelis_ said athos	118.4825
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoi give you back your promise it is well said dantès	103.3373
the air the fresh free air is so good besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour stop cried dartagnan i too am going and if i may without impertinence askwhere are you going to seek my friends what friends those that you asked about yesterday athos porthos and aramisyou are	226.4508
looking for them yes on honor what then is there surprising in that nothing	294.6562
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box	119.7982
peppino was decidedly an epicure	601.2843
ah m	451.8511
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him	135.0053
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority yet jacopo reached him first	266.4077
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you	20.2954
while monte cristo had begged the smellingbottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars	74.0550
milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility	157.9733
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without	153.3509
egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesnt sympathize with the desires of others	331.5320
can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which i have just received said the astonished athos	67.6476
chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sisterinlaws _fauteuil_ milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands	146.5161
she had fallen	46.7004
everything was in readiness	50.0645
no one must disturb us he said i must speak freely to her accuse myself and sayhe approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand	112.8552
have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustainednothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is	77.5923
not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old	106.2874
man relapsed into second childhood m what do you say said the count francs	151.2615
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my fathers faith	95.7864
dartagnans countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen	58.6793
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten no said maximilian you shall not leave him	97.0406
pistache my friend come here	95.4435
when i am convinced that the statement is false what the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamps last remark	205.6422
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter	88.2607
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	312.4030
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	345.1884
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment	94.1635
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye	140.1442
i see you are covered with blood i believe said raoul that i have got something like a scratch on the arm	59.5994
do you doubt my word he said	32.9788
he had not seen morrel	30.9469
he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sublieutenant of the rd of the line	265.3247
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern	218.0674
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her	150.2035
meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on	98.5159
here is the paper do you know the writing as he spoke villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to dantès	38.9923
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio	88.9900
i _beseech_ you the superior and mme	510.0421
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords	363.5535
really villefort you surprise me	778.6954
you ask that put your two hands together	222.6389
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart he wished to see if he could find other traces of violence	52.2930
i cannot endure the modern school of painting you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become old or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors you	220.2972
have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other	101.3381
dartagnan lost no time in useless compliments	376.9524
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time sit down said the old man	35.9560
give me your arm and let us go very well let us go said caderousse but i dont want your arm at all	32.7774
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	141.9864
perfectly well quite rested sir you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth	333.9435
noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation ah indeed said m	66.6067
i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause	85.9695
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentines confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light	125.3045
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same	111.6168
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos	66.1935
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend athos i believe by heaven said dartagnan that i shall embrace him since hes upon our road and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear athos from that very day he becomes my son and i said porthos shall make him my sole heir let us see what more	113.3387
does athos say should you meet on your journey a certain monsieur mordaunt distrust him in a letter i cannot say more monsieur mordaunt exclaimed the gascon surprised	166.7062
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage	110.3438
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mothers servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction	266.1776
ten minutes afterward she was at home	21.8893
your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the person	429.2858
sir said dartagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	54.9784
whatever may ensue i will go if you are determined said athos do so but the bastille said aramis	70.0969
dartagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris	49.3659
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth	86.1691
ah do you see cried the lieutenant	34.4407
de morcerf mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes oh i do not mean her fortune only but tell me what why did you not invite m	129.3252
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were	65.6407
in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them	88.9762
the brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with miladys favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet	112.2964
princes must be knocked on the head i remember it said athos	72.8664
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar	127.5833
ready said he with his usual curtness	47.6431
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it	120.5288
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord as we have before said the postchaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration	190.8822
presently the door opened and she perceived felton	42.0310
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brothers thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had	153.6537
hoped i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry	62.7304
i will send for m	74.9059
de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m	45.4126
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander very likely said albert	229.1491
the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugénie	156.3019
all is well i thank you now leave us alone mr felton chapter l	177.0380
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred	161.4387
in order to make ones way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman	114.0521
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward	802.3687
now then all is agreed let us go down you are going into the garden yes go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it excellent thank you and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	132.9069
yes as you see neighbor caderousse and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied dantès but illconcealing his coldness under this cloak of civility	244.3057
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted	53.0756
poor fellow he exclaimed	20.7659
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillardyou know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head	229.9474
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos	148.4440
see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them	97.3184
grief had made her blind to all but one objectthat was edmond	180.0842
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold	12.8543
yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon	54.7067
pardon me said dartagnan	6.8151

_ luigi vampa what think you of that inquired franz	275.2813
this being understood let us proceed with our history	320.5639
no one would have thought in looking at this old weatherbeaten floraldecked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	298.0215
i should like however to know what this letter addressed to tréville contains and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the kitchen	165.5822
well said aramis	13.9817
madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers julie still lay with her head on his shoulder emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrels family and the sailors at the door	87.0962
milady sprang out of bed and opened the window	28.0984
you are a nobleminded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me	124.6028
but dartagnan is devoid of such weaknesses	220.6032
ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of illhumor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here i wish to knowcan you tell me prayis anything fresh occurring in this part of the town what do you mean	66.3647
at the noise made by dartagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world	88.1163
to remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignationsuch was her plan	186.1957
but dartagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped	126.6199
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friends arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queens service yes its true	59.5315

one morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual	204.3386
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon	134.5332

he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired	227.7860
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move	91.8235
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner	180.8643
thus the day passed away	28.1552
well i have ten thousand for you you are not boasting do you wish for a proof yes there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis	102.2704
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked dartagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	164.9615
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again athos drew the young man toward	61.6205
him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter	35.5013
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea	123.0438
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave	154.7645
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king	69.5222
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving dartagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern	143.5277
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this worlds affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions	112.3797
of the east	84.8528
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night	146.6172
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of arstein eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon m	258.3241
there was a dispute among the guards	73.5629
but i require three weeks preparation at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please three weeks cried albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries	129.1604
when i am all the time suffering dishonor had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge	114.9555
will justify you in m	247.0821
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the doorkeeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the mans footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room	119.6835
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman	100.7468
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind	67.1383
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of	299.6112
no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsars podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a halfdilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large	189.6987
aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin	171.4580
look closely the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald	166.0063
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate	101.8094
it was dartagnan who was waiting for him	13.1040
he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow	332.1603
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story what else have you done after having lost my own horse nine against tensee how neari formed an idea of staking yours yes but you stopped at the idea i hope no for i put it in	137.3845
execution that very minute and the consequence said dartagnan in great anxiety	128.4419
porthos maintained a majestic silence	367.7176
yes said milady lord de winter and now you can understand it all can you not	45.8327
come this way gentlemen come m	216.8199
a conjugal scene chapter xlvi	396.1863
with discretion dartagnan remained behind but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold he turned round and seeing the hesitation of the young man come in cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majestys presence tell her what you have seen encouraged by this invitation dartagnan followed the duke who closed the door after them	93.4556
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead dead dead cried patrick	93.7791
the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were seven	753.4958
and the troop continued their route	201.4171
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver of whom of myself cried morcerf _parbleu_ do you think i cannot be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads	140.0195
the tree was easy to climb	225.7549
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon	178.9809
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something	88.8855
albert de morcerf still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti the morcerfsstay my dear count said danglars you are a man of the world are you not i think so and you understand heraldry a little well look at my coatofarms it is worth more than morcerfs why so because though i am not a baron by birth	84.4269
my real name is at least danglars well what then while his name is not morcerf hownot morcerf not the least in the world go on i have been made a baron so that i actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all impossible listen my dear count m	122.1071
the escort divided into two files	927.2276
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companionit is true then that all our actions leave their tracessome sad others brighton our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sandsit leaves its track alas to many the path is traced by tears sir said	256.4444
madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not	98.4499
oh said he is it you captain	51.8245
m i do not know he is no longer in my hands replied villefort	23.2347
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pockethandkerchief	175.4729
broussels son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the kings officers	191.5157
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis	95.8703
and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs whilst dartagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present circumstances	71.0550
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols	162.1680
the count placed himself between caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat	238.5953
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	78.2923
are you not he asked the priest who here in the château dif is generally thought to beill mad you mean dont you i did not like to say so answered dantès smiling	86.8014
why did you not come down to breakfast	30.9327
because he plainly perceives that his piquette stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine a watered liquor made from the second pressing of the grape	218.1474
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness	146.7550
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked dartagnan	22.4648
i told him very humblyfor i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majestys musketeersi told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions	129.7615
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio	389.6793
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name	169.6394
besides we are safe for today you know the axiom non bis in idem courage sir said raoul to the wounded man	146.0681
dartagnan looked with surprise at his friend	35.6950
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects yes madame chatillon stammered out	282.4983
the moon lighted the group	304.2249
what doest thou here goodfornothing she said and why art thou not at notre dame i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazins permissionyou know mother monsieur bazin the vergeri came to speak to monsieur broussel and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel	278.2389
i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	198.3412
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window dont open the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture	152.1084
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friendnot here at least	84.8322
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	132.3246
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me	142.9674
in the name of heaven run call aramis porthos call for help useless said athos useless for the poison which _she_ pours there is no antidote yes yes help help murmured mme	332.2457
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m	59.3608
four hours later he was in neufchâtel	54.5530
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	149.2657
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set all hands lower the mainsail five minutes after it was down and we sailed under mizzentopsails and topgallant sails	209.3612
dartagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	72.2680
but i was going to tell you that i met m	13.8041
my father said i was his joyyou style me your loveand both of you have called me my child do you remember your father haydée the young greek smiled	160.7329
lucien inquired eugénie	388.5231
pâtés made by the successor of father marteau are described	228.1819
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently	137.8452
he was convinced that luciens visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée dantin	116.3537
a man what man a mendicant give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor sinner this mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see him has he sent no particular message for me yes	181.9309
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home	468.7058
what story can i invent	234.5906
in the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at eight	20.0096
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment	560.8674
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own	123.1726
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said	129.5018
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house	360.9433
to the questions which dartagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad then replied he my visit is illtimed you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will withdraw no no said milady	192.4960
i want to know what crime i have committedto be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector	135.3576
an unhappy prisoner replied dantès who made no hesitation in answering	195.7200
monsieur darminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation	80.7889
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raouls way of riding and observed take care raoul i have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider	104.6416
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring châteaurenaud with you beauchamp availed himself of alberts permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight	131.2455
albert left the cab in which he had come at the counts door intending to take a turn on foot	52.6711
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea	167.5615
chapter lxxi	1466.1102
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner	150.7786
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down	329.2137
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the kings presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night doubtless but there	164.7943
is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him	122.1098
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open	85.7287
you are convinced now edmond are you not asked the abbé	100.9411
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie madame de villefort sighed her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet	123.3027
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings	149.0335
you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid i will do better than that said albert my mother is wishing to go to the seasidewhat day is fixed for your dinner saturday this is tuesdaywell tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at tréport	129.5378
when i informed him that your lordship was the _protégé_ of monsieur de tréville and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman he appeared to be very much disturbed and asked me where that letter was and immediately came down into the kitchen where he knew your doublet was then thats my thief replied dartagnan	99.3181
that was a superb throw so i left off there dartagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast	138.1525
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered	279.3468
monsieur de beaufort or another	53.1592
what does he want with me	23.3246
edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story	195.6896
now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet	114.7079
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion	105.6229
fernand mondego count of morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace is it your father said beauchamp that is quite another thing	184.2205
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted lieutenantgeneral so that now inquired the abbé	132.6065
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place	57.4052
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees	154.6721
you have your servants clothes onyou therefore keep a servant i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals	203.4896
do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant	43.9134
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort	37.5100
danglars himself announced must i receive it or leave it in the hands of the notary this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following day then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a	193.5752
receipt then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance because said andrea with a certain illconcealed uneasiness i thought i heard my fatherinlaw say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody	163.5775
says of trebling your fortune in twelve months	298.0199
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money	329.5582
bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis	111.4518
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe	157.2238
illness he underwent during his confinement	512.8481
but i must not forget one grand point which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense i have indeed by circumstances no by you by me	227.3174
what can i do for you valentine valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtiers eyes	80.9556
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed	122.5220
grimaud he cried remain i wish it then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed he saluted and made a movement to depart	105.0041
do you possess francs inquired the notary	94.7827
with _three_ fingers to be sureone for the father one for the son and one for the holy ghost all crossed themselves	286.6823
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs	66.6213
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him	58.8576
they had not seen him for two days	16.4862
but wait a minute said m	126.1550
after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened	157.3053
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear	69.6680
are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars why do you ask me now because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking how said albert whose brow reddened you think m	81.7340
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	166.7150
fortunately as we have said edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women the wound soon closed	256.2207
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning	160.8383
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness	246.1712
yes sir he said	9.0666
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm	162.9556
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dantès eagerly	95.7428
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedalas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where	122.4290
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both	320.0048
you would then be in present possession of the letter	85.9095
you will go to marseilles said dantèsfor you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them	136.4484
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan	163.0126
_pardieu_ beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed	529.9963
danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so by what right sir by right of the objections you have	125.6173
raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more danglars bit his lips	405.4944
your pardon sir said milady with mildness	99.2020
well asked the two gendarmes	74.6091
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m	155.4516
with the dukes aid they already considered themselves invincible	545.2169
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days to get married yes first and then to go to paris very good have what time you require dantès	124.1208
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen	101.4246
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england	150.0659
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife	82.4980
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage	54.3205
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions	82.8040
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor	186.6010
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses	83.8316
about what time why about fifteen or eighteen days ago exactly so and yesterday evening he came again yesterday evening yes just before you came my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies	154.4983
have you forgotten anything said aramis	40.2013
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles well monseigneur all the details of his coming into and going out of the palaceon the night when he	59.6347
introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune telleryou will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears deaths heads and crossbonesfor in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows	129.0175
appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending is that all monseigneur tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance i will tell him	114.2805
that tell him further that i hold montague in my power that montague is in the bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know exactly then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of	145.7440
ré forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france	110.6215
goodby oh by the way youd better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote	433.3770
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength	335.0218
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked roomshe who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little flowershe whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics	138.8144
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith theres enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris	182.1599
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double	127.6710
for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom	128.9605
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco had	144.8653
done over the moor who would have killed him	105.1745
certainly replied the count are we not in carnival time carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to teresa	74.9457
you put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as i told you oh monsieur monsieur you will kill yourself cried planchet	84.7889
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service the young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated monsieur dartagnan that is it my son the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer	63.0025
the latter bent on his knee and kissed it	43.8821
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart	84.7504
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château dif and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied	130.3141
with salutes of artillery	854.0783
then he had a moments hesitation	59.6789
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty oh a letter a letter from the king perhaps	132.3126
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse	71.6317
de morcerfs asked monte cristo	30.4654
the count received him with his habitual smile	38.1996
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets	79.4896
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them	147.9580
thats it said dartagnan you monsieur le comte de la fere to the right of monsieur groslow	18.8325
buckingham had returned to london mme	80.0272
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	158.0839
de tréville saw m	66.1691
de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you	173.3811
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone	97.9111
and now goodnight go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening	143.3123
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden	41.1293
i dont need the quarter of such a sumi who am still only in the guardsand by selling my saddles i shall procure it	140.5053
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet	189.7162
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered	162.0233
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue	277.5043
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her sons room and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed	58.8554
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations	240.9376
dartagnan seemed iron	15737.4170
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and	89.7769
two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible	96.0395
yes it was so my lord it was soin the left side and with a knife	79.9445
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored oneblood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess	201.9892
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again but how did the accident happen asked raoul	73.0831
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us	73.9385
davrigny smiled sadly	98.3833
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen you see then that i speak to you in the queens name	57.1939
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman	216.8348
it would require years to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other	177.7039
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	277.7173
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	122.6840
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick	165.8299
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedi care very little about that i dont know him	82.6674
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	172.8943
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang youat which i should be most unhappy certainly and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny	171.4618
but since the end of the month m	40.5749
look here resumed dartagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges the devil said porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that do you hear interrupted dartagnan become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that	103.3927
i fill the counts place in everything and he jingled his money	280.2528
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _significant_ if the expression may be used	141.7915
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately the two friends went toward the shed	60.0197
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand	118.2966
danglars yes m	365.9534
de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance	53.3371
oho cried dartagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of ali baba	81.8982
mercédès extended her hand to the count	18.5658
none for a moment dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada	106.5494
it was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave paris by night had been circulated	121.6962
we are mistaken said dartagnan	17.2424
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london	29.5158
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything	245.2534
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	142.4927
listen said he to him	12.9706
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes mr felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest you will hear me to the end my lord	248.6677
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again	204.7822
if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is derived from texts not protected by copyright law does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges	39.4447
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand	192.4664
from being slender he had now become meagre once pale he was now yellow his deepset eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face	175.5884
she was a nun in the convent of the benedictines of templemar	53.5599
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promisenot to reward you i believe that word would offend youbut to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one	158.1019
aramis returned home and athos and dartagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire	220.0023
for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mothercountry as they have preserved its language	165.5613
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels	101.4962
and i also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the place	48.9083
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence	82.8983
it is you monsieur dartagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majestys pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur dartagnan continued the	73.7603
queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said dartagnan bowing	58.1740
_parbleu_ said athos	8.6092
ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by another where is he then in the cellar the cellarwhat cellar our landlords to be sure	120.2884
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other	166.4514
the horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at arras at four oclock in the evening	88.2731
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels	84.9065
but what can i do for you then dartagnan told m	71.7872
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed	182.2172
you are the son of the marchese cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari	76.5118
you see i am generous am i not mother but you my poor child i	103.9881
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart	113.7951
it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it do not be too hasty m	91.3735
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubtedthat is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in	173.7493
the future then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister we have not thought about it yet madame answered dartagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him	136.3441
the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants alas madame exclaimed dartagnan this proves to me that not till today has your majesty had a just idea of us perhaps said anne but that idea if at	220.9753
last i have it your majesty will do us justice	113.6295
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope but one the last the last so that if this fail i am ruinedcompletely ruined as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my	115.4381
fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship and it is not yours no she is a bordeaux vessel _la gironde_ she comes from india also but she is not mine perhaps	134.6973
she has spoken to the _pharaon_ and brings you some tidings of her shall i tell you plainly one thing sir	92.0036
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money	159.9847
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night	49.2470
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property no unfortunately but when i do obtain it well i shall remember old friends i can tell you that yes since you have such a good memory what do you want	82.5727
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile	164.3518
did he take baptistin with him no my lord call him then i wish to speak to him the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant	42.7724
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion	169.9801
oh cried porthos as if in pain	158.4829
no sir and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you a glass of wine will be extremely welcome the fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the gascon to porthos	100.8066
ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head	38.5386
he answered in the same language	64.4147
how go then exclaimed dartagnan	194.6269
and now you are assembled gentlemen said dartagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word _apologies_ a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis	110.8548
de morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy i perceive what you are intending to propose to me but i cannot accept it edmondmy son would not permit it nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf	117.1836
and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend m worthy caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us yes to be sure i am	74.7614
sit down dear count and go on with your story at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame	83.4575
are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name undoubtedly really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people	342.9893
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man	59.0073
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	164.9753
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do	109.2853
he had the resolution to stop with this	68.5677
yes sire and yours monsieur dherblay yes sire as you wish then	114.6358
but the real adieux were made in mme	274.6041
yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you	26.2342
what do you mean	4.1339
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important	80.2828
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visitsthe bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a	283.2517
brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind	155.8277
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly	336.8682
if i take you you will be hung the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horses head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud	65.7377
now one evening when dartagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which	141.8152
led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	72.3517
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture	91.0839
the boat was built for speed her two paddlewheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird	184.9922
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	127.4166
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheekbones were broad and projecting a neverfailing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large	203.9686
and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his buttonhole	247.9292
he then entered the room	23.1499
a fête was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance	93.0554
m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i	83.9387
had twentyone five more than last year	589.8988
ah you resist do you cried jussac	477.4637
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars	33.2693
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and i were drinking and what did you do said dartagnan	91.9884
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew	129.6776
go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me bernouin bowed and retired	110.7518
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow	120.5432
dartagnan porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords	164.6588
go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence	266.6399
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful	150.1634
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration	215.2534
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases	174.2536
albert led him first to his _atelier_ which was as we have said his favorite apartment	96.6815
i will denounce this place of infamy	266.1009
davrigny himself	366.6643
order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters	89.7775
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir	90.8505
i am lord de winter brotherinlaw of that _woman_ the three friends uttered a cry of surprise	47.6188
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone	342.7961
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	151.0477
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	75.0646
be civil or i shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones rank you dont choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned dartagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to	170.7603
conceal my name enough enough what is your name i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat	81.0634
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale	113.7194
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival	220.4189
who are you and what do you want cried she	25.4300
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutors misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him	189.2731
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy	17.7707
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent	124.1541
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist	69.1348
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk	110.6754
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder well now that will do wonderfully well said athos	171.3354
mme	nan
davrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips	27.2003
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard	54.6976
speak he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made	89.2167
commandant of the guardsan appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers tis the appointment monsieur de tréville held you ask of me the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de tréville has left it it has not been filled but it is one of the principal military appointments in the kings household monsieur de tréville was	109.5239
but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed	147.6555
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning	205.9441
the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably	114.8451
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i cannot leave	40.8043
chapter	nan
he was the worst musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable	189.7389
the prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed	117.2422
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited dartagnans reply	166.6625
here i am said he	19.5013
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean	113.4875
it is well as it is say no more about it at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wifes secrets	64.9656
order of the king he said	38.4433
do not speak so loud young mandont speak so loud	265.5818
they directed their horses to the city	55.0442
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read m _extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saintjacques held february th _ franz stopped	111.7878
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means	138.0058
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtuesdont you think so	118.0649
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more halfpistoles in any way perhaps replied dartagnan	50.9740
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not i know nothing said m	53.6212
sire said dartagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question louis xiv	44.3232
oh my dear dartagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me conceal your wounds when you have any silence is the last joy of the unhappy	121.2240
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth	257.0999
m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case	175.2345
of need	10681.9629
what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the saintemarguérite islands	90.6051
the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone	217.8022
in a corner was the spanish companion donna estafania who had followed her from madrid	205.2361
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor	294.5108
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they cannot or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks	173.1291
you have committed a piece of folly said athos but it cant be helped there is no drawing back	78.9773
monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie	151.8893
morrel	nan
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain thats useless said dartagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs	108.5496
the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held	79.0351
in one case or the other the trial was soon over	165.2399
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds	88.4065
the procurators wife waited tremblingly	233.7995
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume	141.8660
_ma foi_ i havent consulted my daughter but if she has good taste oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his fathers position is good hem said danglars	138.4414
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you	145.1682
i told you so athos said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	34.2432
my dear fellow dont speak like that of monsieur groslow	63.5190
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated	179.1836
there is a carriage coming said châteaurenaud	89.5857
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat	81.6884
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied	250.0328
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing	128.7485
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am mme	95.0374
it is running now dartagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever	153.2811
a week passed by	56.6037
five minutes afterward they knocked at the princes door	43.2808
no one answered to his first knocking	200.8512
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	121.6785
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its silence	683.4709
in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor	142.1573
then when they had disappeared he said with a smiletis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself	154.4195
as gracefully as a waterfowl ere it takes to the wing set sail	533.0087
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday an hour after sunset if they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour in a quarter of an hour at most your arm is still strong enough is it not porthos porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his	140.0314
shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man	123.0907

i do not understand you i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him fernand cried mercédès i believed you were goodhearted and i was mistaken fernand you are wicked to call	102.4177
to your aid jealousy and the anger of god yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage	83.7914
the procureur exerted himself to reply	139.1843
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news said he	144.1965
and my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen i expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him gave him cried dartagnan	75.6247
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling yes	179.8584
bonacieux but why then did you cry out so do you not understand said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind	75.3175
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind	73.8452
the latter retained the counts hand between his	84.4862
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief	127.8837
is he living patience monseigneur we are coming to it	211.9424
they laugh best who laugh last having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawingroom whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée dantin	344.3548

his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel cried dartagnan you were all in the plot then and i really dont know what prevents me from exterminating you all alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see	198.9676
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him	333.7844
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder	47.8421
the cemetery of the château dif chapter	16.8902

there was no time to lose	15.1056
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous	502.1186
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	119.1711
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe	80.7331
we are so good and gentle to your eminence	67.8794
thus dartagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means	178.0982
the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and dartagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss	122.1000
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme	214.7886
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you	120.3799

this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjectsfallen from her high estate indeed well my lord four men resolved to save her	201.7196
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	79.7986
the deputy procureur du roi chapter	286.8018
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder	54.4879
dépinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection	146.1776
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	99.5709

i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you	51.0065
the drop of water chapter lxiv	149.1545
as dartagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen	57.6416
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint	71.2939
oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation	213.6925
dartagnan smiled	93.3542
its a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved	197.2992
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation hush said athos speaking in a low voice	23.7311
this method was so simple that dartagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively	240.4815
i have been looking for him but without success he will be here tonight in what part of the house in the baronesss box i believe that charming young woman with her is her daughter yes i congratulate you morcerf smiled	77.6664
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen	53.6720
the night monte cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous _suivezmoi_ then he rose and went out	159.0941
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned	105.9561
bonacieux dartagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left halffainting upon an armchair	111.4270
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	91.0344
and alone no my lord madame has visitors have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict _incognito_ no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing and who is with madamem	105.0325
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand	48.4769
fool that i was i have almost killed myself by my needless haste	115.7573
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations	223.2861
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise	339.6680
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inauspicious	101.5249
but to return to what we were saying	72.6324
if the king was still irritated against them they would depart without being seen if the king consented to see them they would only have to be called	67.6805
the queen had confidence in the courage of dartagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced	60.2553
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom	79.6562
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through	157.1598
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage	142.2271
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly	99.1815
great honor for i am aware that m	41.5231
saved replied the young officer	41.2731
where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly	76.5299
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sisterinlaw was a prostitute a branded woman	110.8405
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr oreilly	122.1167
nor you to mine cried the abbé	96.8404
splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots	146.2445
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and	156.5312
body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned	313.9174
it would be exceedingly droll the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	142.2013
bonacieux starting	3376.9404
you sustained me powerfully sir and i protest to you that today i feel very lonely	222.9244
milady passed her two arms round feltons neck and let herself slip out of the window	94.9662
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment she questioned emmanuel but he knew nothing or would not say what he knew	66.6794
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saintjeanauxbois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest	92.4351
what am i	43.8203

at vincennes tis true one lives faster my lord replied la ramee my lord or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing la ramee was going out	147.0638
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him	106.6375
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to fortyfive years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and wellshaped mustache	109.9023
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room	121.8488
the two men followed the company and on leaving the faubourg st antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them	187.1040
if i am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age i must turn gourmand my lord said la ramee if you will take a bit of good advice dont put that off till you are old good said the duc de beaufort to himself every man	110.7981
in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that master la ramees is gluttony	338.4664
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it his threat completed the intimidation of the host	57.8178
how much have you left of your hundred pistoles dartagnan of my hundred pistoles	95.4299
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul morrel smiled sadly	158.9922
does your majesty require anything further	141.6544
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left	169.3605
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa that was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera	155.2649
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st cloud opposite destréess pavilion	186.9417
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villeforts was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever	193.0075
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens	159.8903
m oh he exclaimed as though a redhot iron were piercing his heart	233.2762
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	65.4296
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis	43.3136
a frondeur you the comte de la fere on the side of broussel blancmesnil and viole for shame you a frondeur on my word of honor said athos one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur	110.5065
the splendor was within	713.8279
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted and what was it that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes you believe in sorcerers then you fool ii mind	161.1438
them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giulio who cares about them as an italian he is superstitious the duke shrugged his shoulders	121.4624
i have a party at my house tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera	97.6917
general oliver cromwell the four friends looked at one another	49.5756
yes returned aramis	151.9225
but as i cannot and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldiers gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance	141.5457
during this time nothing new occurred in the camp at la rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st louis at st germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers	145.7071
intact my dear friend besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine but what is the use of harnesses without horses i have an idea about them athos you make me shudder listen to me	108.0787
see john see how well she knows how to handle a knife in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will	337.1865
and the crew asked morrel	181.8160
de villefort	4.0417
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit	28.8732
at the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia	33.3022
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper	97.9718
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	158.5198
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemys entire army	160.8628
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to	102.2833
your eyes i have not lost sight of you you know what i have done i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady	63.5454
have you seen anything they asked	50.9424
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london	37.6699
the island of tiboulen dantès although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt	155.6259
it dragging him down still lower	1247.0134
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer	70.7717
news from your father do you hear henrietta	108.2344
all we can now do is to wait	157.3501
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know i have enemies replied dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for that	101.7172
upon my word you did well to come back nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start its the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily	135.0123
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty	176.2078
dartagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly	78.6801
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described	162.0223
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	85.4505
morrel yes but we will talk of it well then three months said penelon	87.5434
de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassinsome brigand escaped from the gallows apparently true said beauchamp i saw it in the paper	217.7917
dartagnan pressing his hand repeated his call	202.6281
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped	173.4766
now my fault is repaired	318.6505
well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance	130.9585
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous he does not like eugénie sufficiently	136.4079
hold continued dartagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins	104.7432
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	141.5768
by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household	120.9588
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondys coachman	80.2500
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire fire then when the shot was fired	95.1656
what is that again he asked	49.8874
fortunately deceived by dartagnans trick they neglected to reload their guns	678.5321
this is not a corsican _maquis_ but an english garden badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that monsieur i implore you do not stay there i think you are going mad bertuccio said the count coldly	132.4743
i cannot calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me	110.5519
a light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers	162.1655
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof	169.1516
you came you say to see me yes well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day am i then to remain here eternally demanded milady with a certain terror	77.0433
we must leave you said monte cristo	20.5460
de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home	50.6609
oh i cannot behold this frightful spectacle said he	148.1963
edmond did not close his eyes	48.4555
oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of god at least in your own name if not as priest then as son pardon you cried the pretended monk pardon you perhaps god will pardon you but i never for pitys sake said the executioner extending his arms	106.7688
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like motherofpearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue	185.6830
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to dartagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer	140.0258
the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires	191.4129
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentines room opened and monte cristo reappeared	21.7891
and now i am a frondeurnot of broussels party nor of blancmesnils nor am i with viole but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and delbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and lowborn lawyers	274.1621
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up	152.0879

i in my turn may require your aid and influence let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall	169.6602

you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess we understand each other perfectly then	140.9149
the young man knelt down	29.4944
i was only speaking in reference to the secondrate fortunes we were mentioning just now and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner	127.9111
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine do you want me to go away ah no no	50.6801

_pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied dartagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air	68.2361
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends	147.7112
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated	222.4414
de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfathers is valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m	226.9716

after whitsuntide it would be another thing there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction	132.1311
she is goddaughter to laporte the confidential valet of the queen	199.7835
monsieur laporte said dartagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him but not every	63.7796

his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly	342.3964
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy cold	58.4196

louis xiii	2.2768
but dont fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word	65.8405
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage	62.9828
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague	241.6410
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again	135.8740
the order was executed	206.2480
she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her	40.2540
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you yes sir answered raoul	80.9712
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms	40.3430
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise	120.9600

m it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation	58.2688
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust	130.2874
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon	543.7720
the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks	103.0887
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him	108.6798
then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet	106.5660

but there must be some cause for this strange scene the count of morcerfs adventure exasperates the young man have you anything to do with it it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his fathers treason indeed said morrel	89.2493
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visitingroom	97.1123

it was the signal of a visit	38.4069
do you think emmanuel would oblige me i will answer for him count well	85.9518
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said	84.0062
the count watched him	50.1032
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her	163.3202
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her	66.3312
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony	118.1343
in that hotel	236.4199
yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said morcerf	36.3225

the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it	233.5817
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror	50.5129
the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such	78.9072
a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemaryfor upon seeing this hotheaded youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before	304.5217
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor shipowner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources	176.2697
de saintméran had been unwell for some days still the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave	117.2125
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances	136.5386
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber	226.4746
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight	63.5162
that you may be sure said the gascon means something they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it	153.6894
in the name of heaven explain yourself oh monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied dartagnan	72.0476

noirtier everybody except the person who gave it to me and that was too much far too much murmured villefort	85.3671
ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet i exclaimedforgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather they may do what they will with me i will never leave you when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven but without uttering a word	105.2374
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke	192.6391
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar	139.9282
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you	57.4903

de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed	177.3094
the counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	439.9698
they will have nothing to do then at this end said mordaunt	49.9533
your mother he said	42.2344

danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf	81.9600
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding	92.6148
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name	79.4218
it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passersby but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passersby repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on	252.2370
one side like the masks of the ancients	73.6014
one thing only puzzles me namely how franz dépinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife	188.2342
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived methe trick you spoke of last night has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault	133.2872

well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo	56.1380
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away	197.4041

the second night the door opened i was lying on the floor for my strength began to abandon me	53.6167
it was agreed that milady should wait for felton till ten oclock if he did not return by ten oclock she was to sail	41.2765
morrel we shall see	81.6292
de tréville wanted	71.0716

best means of making his court to me is to rail at him	247.1110
give me those papers and leave us the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired	96.2586
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo	55.5581
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed	133.5724
patience patience in four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to youmore open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days england will be relieved of you milady folded her hands and raising her fine eyes toward heaven lord lord said she with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone pardon this	178.2796
man as i myself pardon him yes pray accursed woman cried the baron your prayer is so much the more generous from your being i swear to you in the power of a man who will never pardon you and he went out	98.3418
yes said porthos but there are the equipments that is very true	45.2290
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions	134.5750
dessessart made him a sign to approach	15.3256
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart	252.8215

tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging four men prepared to do so	155.2167
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	52.1603
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarins mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned dartagnan	181.3092
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his	95.6338
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures	152.1949
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life	191.3260
no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately	121.3679
no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of anyones	117.7453
a sob was the only sound he heard	83.3482
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world you live alone then i do you have no sisterno sonno father i have no one how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life it is not my fault madame	92.6348
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her	89.1192
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	93.7325
at each shot morrel turned pale	276.3465
danglars door just at the same time that villeforts landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg sainthonoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house	91.8993
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful	104.6679
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place	143.1079
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	119.6978
do you pity him	92.7198
yes buckingham the woman was english then no she was french but she had married in england the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door	121.5282
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited	248.7828
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms	357.5521
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine	111.2825
tis settled replied dartagnan	232.1933

the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers and the open places lakes after the great rains which fell in january the seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital	151.9817

england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance	836.3129
salute my hero viscount and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten	196.4001
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before	122.0054

in fact at halfpast eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawingrooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen	166.8584

is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room	85.4373
his shoulderknots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron	248.5621
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity	22.7451
he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again	143.4877

i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage bertuccio bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the door he paused and then said at what oclock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready at five oclock replied the count	93.6541
a hundred pistoles a hundred pistoles for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamondhe cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to dartagnanwhich is worth at least ten thousand francs he returned to his room and after depositing the	64.1632
ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gunfire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris	159.9603
what can you expect athos	56.7161
will you not even say you will see me again he asked	33.9477
bonacieux eagerly and looking at dartagnan with disquiet	191.4009
to the wall to the wall and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch	95.3458
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and illbred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished	81.5185
therelisten and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode	125.1042
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living	217.1547
beauchamps i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	75.9261
if i were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do	98.5829
he turned and saw julie	100.9807
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted	90.4953
he likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	135.2291
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead	129.8707
five millions on five little scraps of paperit must be seen to be believed you do not doubt it no you say so with an accentstay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly	106.5598
not the thing is so curious i will make the experiment myself	87.8560
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room	87.4290
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends	128.7744
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dantès	315.4607
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against him well well returned m	85.0239
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently	149.0293
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case	107.0415
m	nan
your fortune exceeds francs does it not asked he	173.1097
he threw himself upon it and fell asleep	52.2862
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms	95.9807
i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	119.2744
i have measures to take she will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault athos i will be accountable for her said athos	62.4643
these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the secret	209.4825
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydées countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my	113.5500
request oh it is nothing said monte cristo	23.8880
daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak	61.2883
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter	148.2621
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms	84.6875
it might be called a magnificent prison	124.4460
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile	82.6159
well have you any news athos asked	71.9690
well suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries	127.0003
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied dartagnan and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account	56.2449
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of selfsatisfaction	45.1110
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the rospoli palace	54.0486
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him	135.8011
from that moment the old mans eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it	15.5721
it is he whom we must warn	70.4560
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living imbecile exclaimed la carconte	143.5076
that gascon has saved a queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro really it is as i have the honor of telling it to your excellency tell me a little about it my dear monsieur de rochefort that is somewhat difficult my lord said rochefort with a	79.8377
smile	nan
i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights	93.9523
de villeforts antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name	93.6035
go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day tomorrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after tomorrow five and in three days you will be in bed	113.5983
do you know about that institution i have heard of it it is a magnificent charity having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies	108.3970
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide	152.3140
the latter faithful to the principle of horace _nil admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught	379.5026
yet stammered dantès wiping the perspiration from his browyet i gave you two hundred francs when i left three months ago yes yes edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor caderousse	86.8521
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending	288.4230
morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze southsouthwest after a weeks calm when captain gaumard comes up to mei was at the helm i should tell youand says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself	289.5157
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st laurence on his gridiron	373.8889
then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced	47.2662
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m	43.7071
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardonyou from the queen we from mazarinwhich were we all four together would never be granted	256.9614
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass what is to be done said porthos	44.7299
it would be very kind of you no i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be are we alone yes replied the count going to the door and returning	59.8906
danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m	288.5571
let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to london and back	257.7231
stay said dartagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged him	51.5608
coquenard was served first then porthos	439.6173
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	66.0644
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles	92.1720
the duchess was the first to speak	37.3018
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count well i rely upon your promise	100.5242
empty your pockets said he i want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out	103.4898
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady	91.6735
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage	32.4106
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled	101.2207
the first person to attract the attention of dantès as he landed on the canebière was one of the crew belonging to the _pharaon_	61.9158
it was brought to me	32.5883
day came the jailer entered	86.0378
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about	143.1297
the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	119.6279
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large	119.3274
fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was	143.7190
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume	157.9159
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your fathers life when he wished to destroy himself as you do todaybecause i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the _pharaon_ to old morrelbecause i am the edmond dantès	100.9800
who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo	161.2538
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedychange of scene and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity	142.9261
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that dartagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place	114.0152
immediately replied dartagnan we have not a minute to lose hello grimaud planchet mousqueton bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hôtel each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey	155.9808
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father	160.0715
i will do my best well then let us goi must trust to you it is very fortunate said dartagnan to himself	56.1620
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph	110.4411
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne	126.0874
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenica bon mot which had great success	189.0110
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night	152.1364
dartagnan was beside himself with joy	47.5008
here is m	28.1865
dartagnan asked mazarin anxiously	520.5312
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his breast	99.1368
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice	259.3323
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts	142.6001
besides what would the sailors say	92.5448
thank god my child was not then dead no it was not dead and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy	54.6124
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto	161.1391
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed	176.7016
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit handsome wellbred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations how young this dartagnan is said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign	134.7032
to grimaud to bring another bottle	309.5363
how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who	57.4578
all was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porters lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said	215.1244
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	117.3386
the thing is simple enough	68.5004
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm	64.6494
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing	443.6606
if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass valentinevalentineyou would have been doomed but exclaimed the young girl why am i thus pursued whyare you so kindso goodso unsuspicious of ill that you cannot understand valentine no i have never injured her but you are rich valentine you have livres a year and you prevent her son from	128.7168
enjoying these livres how so	282.0581
in all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning	283.6816
grimaud shook his head negatively	110.9846
the thin spare man yes the executioner in short asked aramis	907.6010
there only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	140.4032
porthos aramis and dartagnan followed his example	89.3786
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph	44.8656
silence child hush we are flying i did not understand	187.7969
but let us return to business yes i was going to say if i were in your place well i would realize how would you realize i would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six months i would decamp well well said andrea that isnt a bad idea my dear friend	82.3861
said caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice you will be none the worse off physically or morally but said andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me	162.9471
you seem secretly elated yes giulio she said proud and happy for i have found the means of strangling this hydra you are a great politician my queen said mazarin let us hear the means and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper	186.5139
it is here unlock the door antoine the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the _mad abbé_ as the prisoner was usually called	193.9817
at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped	26.5235
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brotherinlaw	183.0968
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced	147.2050
perform your duty in camp i will do mine elsewhere	246.5880
today yes bless me i quite forgot the races	628.9788
if i had but the time to train pupils but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moments repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england ah _à propos_ of the cardinal monsieur de tréville i am vexed with you this was the chance at which	139.7688
m	nan
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you	32.4473
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there	177.9505
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not todayin a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm	116.1502
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task	199.8242
look that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lackey in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to him	125.6987
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission	68.4138
you didnt know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side	88.6553
he pushed through the crowd approached athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber	143.8006
the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word	192.8475
we are friends are we not she asked	64.9273
take it quickly thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove off	101.7074
he	nan
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	17.2959
where were we i recollect you were saying said dartagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france	100.2781
the queen was still standing when he entered but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here to make madame in the name of	86.4211
the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers how monsieur an investigation of my papersmine truly this is an indignity be kind enough to pardon me madame but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs	153.3966
run to torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer	116.1968
ah i have been running very fast mademoiselle but i must do m	135.5568
nothing ambiguous if you please	176.3448
but devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions	170.7631
i shall not go why asked porthos	52.9110
i did my best to make them drunk	197.9644
come then and take it friend said the gascon	40.4958
if i made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith	158.6398
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	154.2017
you cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queens hand led her to the window	180.0007
he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases	117.3867
do what monsieur de la fere requests that is your name is it not sir i have another name madamei am called athos madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled you hear sir said the queen	81.5520
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	72.5783
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than dartagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a mans head inside the carriage	136.6618
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke	71.2845
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side good thought dartagnan in this direction i am satisfied he pressed aramiss hand and went in search of porthos	173.6761
fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step	253.0631
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m	126.4248
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each others throat	90.6233
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends	73.3347
m give way said the traveller	186.3290
and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in do you know him i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken	73.1000
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence i do not understand stammered lucien	74.3449
is life worth the trouble of so many questions	238.2302
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	109.0696
the cardinal therefore rose to open it	99.2750
he then looked at the objects near him	78.6498
my friends thats exactly like me i retained my harness by instinct	413.4455
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress	123.4152
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period	129.9340
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet then he carried haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will	173.7580
for me i have asked for no leave of absence hold your tongue and take it said dartagnan	74.9724
yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us	35.6202
meanwhile villefort and davrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold	182.9173
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack	130.9337
i misunderstood you	294.8077
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants	106.3046
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken	57.7624
i cannot speak latin responded the marquise	425.0981
whom does your highness wish me to send to you any one except grimaud the officer of the guard then with his chessboard yes five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess	99.7496
monsieur dartagnan murmured raoul	72.8085
but what then must be done asked morrel	41.0067
porthos knocked with his hand	36.3095
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for dartagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual	67.0970
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	231.1735
i respect old age but i dont much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt	191.0990
the office of the kings attorney chapter	23.8775
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head	35.5674
rochefort had returned to the chevalier dhumieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call	477.4154
go on count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called grief m i believe all you tell me	119.6104
without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and i almost did so	106.9422
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not	142.6500
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance	466.9391
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner	114.7780
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa	134.9598
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was	85.4451
danglars appeared delighted with you was he not	150.1995
chapter xxxi	41.8755
a prisoner he reiterated	612.0634
what are you doing cried kitty	40.3565
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said _saccommodi_ the italian _saccommodi_ is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase	119.9338
of molières that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance	340.8062
reflect upon it dartagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that dartagnan carried into everything	392.9798
i shall go and die by his side madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself oh god exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to heaven have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that	134.1558
once existed in the world i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully i once spoke to you of four men what can be done with four four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time and where are these four men ah that is what i do not know	114.8425
dartagnan looked attentively at the building	52.8834

the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination	198.3327
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill	108.5628
you are almost a boy i see that you require someone to answer for me i admit that would reassure me greatly do you know athos no porthos no aramis no who are these gentleman three of the kings musketeers	139.2301
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper	83.1609
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	45.8520
very probably answered the count	95.4505
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition	89.3003
yes my lord and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal and we start in his carriage then yes my lord and with us no other escort but you two is it not enough	61.3677
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged	69.9446
you asked for candor and you have it	149.2375
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone	60.6572
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparationsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	91.7237
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered	238.8810
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabitedthe only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count	204.8843
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano	83.7915
he motioned to valentine to approach	100.2341
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majestys favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin	182.9380
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m	276.3747
yes my lord replied the servant m	32.3563
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m	53.0154
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	459.9099
oh yes yes this instant i entreat you in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	95.9991
yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened	131.4043
danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary	95.5145
to reflect before i give you an answer to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all	204.9667
events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them i do not understand you baron said morcerf	114.0882
yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude in that case it would be quite another thing	112.1464
danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your buttonhole yes they sent me the order of charles iii returned debray carelessly	122.5252
but let us return to yourself	20.0636
yes	nan
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years	114.3612
because i would not annoy my little benedetto	149.1004

de villefort the kings attorney ah said the priest in a marked italian accent yes i have heard that death is in that house then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you i was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our duties it is a young girl i know	62.3181
it sir the servants who fled from the house informed me	173.8480
hold your tongue stupid fellow said dartagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury	181.5337
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly	53.4804
the pistol fell from his hands	85.5975
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades	85.2524
ah you remain in london said porthos	61.7057
count returned signor pastrini hurt at alberts repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and	110.6943
doublebarrelled guns	344.9533
he is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars	92.9071
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the stranger	147.5121
then i forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the light	42.3159
sit down and i will read it again albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend	113.3920
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation	128.3716
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged	33.2004
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinals hat	102.2555
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was uselessall the features of the dying man were distorted with agony	122.3522
in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked andrea turned pale and drew towards the door he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm	110.3839
a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead	189.9947
well demanded dartagnan	189.6306
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the diningroom	151.2362
yes yes said milady the letter is precise	89.8661
m maximilian smiled	247.9912

unfortunately no was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister	53.0098
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles	90.2113
there is halfpast ten striking albert m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp	193.1049
dartagnan remember this my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine	162.8024
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice	134.7903
as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio	118.9923
morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m	288.4090
what do you say of him	12.7484
are you french sir said he to athos	43.7315
and you as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home	66.7984
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	53.7917
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole monsieur dartagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment	158.9490
have men loved me	232.8668
my dear athos i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for a fortnight	145.4274
have you anything particular against him possibly did you ever meet him previously to coming hither i have and where will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you i promise upon your honor upon my honor then listen to me franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the	87.1196
island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them	97.6479
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my	155.0919
wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance	82.0142
on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing	315.7727
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks my dear fellow i mistrust women	95.5038
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil _rue du helder on the_ _st	154.1114
may halfpast ten_ chapter	10355.6045
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the antechamber where dartagnan was waiting	49.3638
forgive my servants he said for a terror i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far	126.4297
then i speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise	166.2448
i am the most wretched of men	54.7240
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged	151.0832
jesus seigneur	733.3436
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven oclock of the morning in the month of january sir said planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know tell us what returned dartagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are	111.1885

on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	53.0525
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence	223.0358
now you are a man and are able to give me advice yet i repeat to you albert be prudent why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust	71.1389
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard	72.3787
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably	271.7519
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m	63.1259
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingthat will signify but little that concerns god you and myself mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m	197.8227
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham palace	88.3920
moreover you are our prisoners fool cried aramis knowest thou not then mordaunt	235.1444
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the kings safety	102.6802
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse but he will not wish for only one harness stake both _pardieu_ i am not selfish as you are you would do so said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself	145.9405
i know something of him but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back tomorrow which means that you now hesitate no i do not hesitate god forbid but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without	141.2235

we are observed they are coming to meet us	35.4504
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve oclock	345.3490

when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man	79.6018
he took his way toward the hôtel of m	26.0904

but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat	188.9527
louvieres recognized him and bowed	46.8098
what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious	81.4611

by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister	200.4444
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemys army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly	86.9893
showed was an army in order of battle	156.3801
as to aramis he never played	92.8002

go young men go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely	398.4560
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor	186.6764
m dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall	118.0024

he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him	119.2347
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded	160.8901
dartagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms	232.9068
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small casket	40.9613
consider well what you do in that house	60.5948
sure of himself convinced of his own power certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him he went straight to the object he aimed at even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it	143.2133

now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time	129.0457
noirtier closed his eyes	36.6906
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage	70.1593

then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried	149.7370

of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy	92.1828
you mean to say we _have lost_ said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table	79.7368
but that act of selfcontrol effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess	94.8497

franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of braccianos	48.5224
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of dartagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before	56.7062
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible	168.9561

farewell he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	26.2972
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship	102.1603
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently	216.0637
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite corrupt	209.0938
ah indeed said cavalcanti	178.7844
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory	246.0361
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence	106.5085
noirtier which she cannot be when she becomes the baroness dépinay	222.0595
from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts	124.6181
ah said andrea deeply affected	154.7795
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king	98.5838
de saintméran demanded monte cristo	32.4658

a prisoner has escaped from the château dif and they are firing the alarm gun replied dantès	140.6591
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me fortune has been kind to you then	144.5737
take care i repeat to you take care	50.8185
dartagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times	217.4771
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety	98.6052
i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here the cavalier addressed some words in english to his sister	127.5858

the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed	57.9430
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said athos	75.8712
well what are you doing countto a former lackey	137.4087
not the least noise was to be heard it might be imagined that he was a hundred miles from the capital	37.0260
your husband then is at last dead how does that concern you replied the swiss	150.5881
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal yes and the queen too the queen do you say to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i dont know how she has regained possession	111.7161
but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you so i think replied dartagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and	89.2883
youto whom are you devoted now to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf magnificent my dear fellow magnificent in the first place you have plenty of money havent you	89.1010
monsieur i love men of your kidney and i foresee plainly that if we dont kill each other i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation	143.6380
neither had any	51.1655
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé	74.0985
madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for anything come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may heaven hear you chapter xxxvii	108.1721
it was an ambuscade shouted dartagnan	87.1820
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity	185.0726
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open	131.4000
go upstairs she said to the doctor	43.4419
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said	92.6977
bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	162.6835
it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably	79.7813
he was carried home in the arms of the people	35.2432
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i dont know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are	96.4205
here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason	233.1360
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinala change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that	63.4544
no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution	166.1954
begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes very well it is your own doing	75.6819
on the contrary that simplifies the matter greatly	86.9984
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune	147.6372
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire	128.6089
as he gained the top of the rue guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him	65.4078
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon but upon one condition what is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over	150.0097
i saw madame de saintméran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said châteaurenaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	120.0480
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable	198.9858
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrancegate and cast out on the doorsteps m	105.9781
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like deathit does not come alone listen	172.0553
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m	127.7728
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be hush dont let us talk politics my lord then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and i should have news from those without the prison walls ah yes but how can the news be brought to	152.9807
you nothing easier in a game of tennis for example in a game of tennis asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the dukes words	133.6188
one was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden petals	279.6820
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautifulalways beautiful cried louise	185.0264
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length	50.4685
excuse me said dartagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him	85.6979
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me i do better than that siri save you you do	62.6257
oh i am dying he again fainted	172.7991
those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache	27.8873
besides what does the gospel say	69.6777
dartagnan rushed out of the room	24.3646
my mother was a christian and she prayed	79.9100
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which	98.7976
he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired	196.8350
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital	64.7011
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do	22.6260
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing	226.5677
to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape	117.2147
solely from having served me	176.9603
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry	120.7004
he vaulted hastily from his horse whilst planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house	71.7609
as we have said he was lying on the deck	30.9788
at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i will or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m	115.3228
it is he who in an encounter with your eminences guards decided the victory in favor of the kings musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah	141.0738
ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable dartagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal	50.1087
noirtier again closed his eyes	44.2574
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend	136.7619
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur demery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity	201.2015
what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp sayshave i	2151.8193
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw	84.0459
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect	49.7102
you are joking now replied andrea	143.0817
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinals death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand	146.7846
dartagnan was perplexed	502.1964
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay	61.2900
continue and say what we must do now monsieur laporte said dartagnan finish dressing his majesty we may go then asked the queen	86.5942
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week asked the mercer piqued to the quick	84.5847
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged	72.3299
porthos was in bed and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with mousqueton to keep his hand in while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell	197.0632
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her	109.3020
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough	122.6086
laws alone swamp our small staff	1523.4263
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all	55.0195
unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister and besides she added her eyes troubled and moistened with tears wait wait fernand you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms fernand made no	134.7696
reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his hearts blood but these tears flowed for another	201.3769
faith yes it is so long ago answered porthos	54.1790

while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no which he had occupied on his last stay at compiègne	172.7421
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle thats very simple replied athos	101.9613
neither was it as with our neighbors the english an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the year	245.4068
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples	390.6914
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down	51.3995
but what detains her	266.1694
the gascons are the scots of france dartagnan bowed to the duke and was retiring	62.3253
beware my lord you are in the hands of god in the hands of the devil you mean cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting	63.1276
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams	87.8972
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her deathbed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel	132.0297
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected	54.7466
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love	116.5904
every door was opened to him	33.7018
did edmond make you his heir no merely his testamentary executor	1067.1622
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward	159.4902
you have decided friend said athos	120.1718
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation	268.2823
noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer	171.1259
the fowl had not been poisonedshe had died of apoplexy	139.1406
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards	499.2267
in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law	145.2822
we should command an annuity of livres	302.3054
without losing sight of her for an instant the concierge took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court and blew it	41.9070
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself	92.7308
m the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day	172.5383
that great giant who was there gave it to him in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him to be sure the coadjutor has promised	120.8462
who told you that monsieur maillard himself you have seen him then certainly i was there when he fell what were you doing there i was shouting down with mazarin death to the cardinal the italian to the gallows isnt that what you would have me shout be quiet you rascal said bazin looking uneasily around	141.1589
consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger m i beseech of you maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of	323.4249
this fine crop of lucern	583.2891
now there remains the chevalier or the abbé dherblay as your majesty pleases does he wish to be a bishop no madame something easier to grant what it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville the queen smiled	93.2280
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	116.0582
there said he there is the work complete	166.6633
by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades	191.8132
noirtier and barrois partook	825.5034
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one	135.5450
when he had gained the angle of the street he turned	22.2584
when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted	87.6848
what do you want sir said the king	10.1286
at eight oclock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition	43.9713

suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with	101.2967
convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study	88.8535

we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	73.1926
all were still	122.6687
now as at the moment in which dartagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression	176.1768
to stray over his countenance	443.2244
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned i was going out sir then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow no said the count with an imperceptible smile	75.3702

de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air	112.4745
i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related	79.8672

in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a skyblue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the	51.3404

well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo what do i think said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of	112.7866
smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars such was alberts opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it	273.5298
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and dartagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends	63.1139
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered posthorses at noon	404.8921
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you	45.2561
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service	56.0984
i know them by their romantic imagination	445.5105
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me	513.5022

de tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of st germain	46.7943
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfathers wish	113.1527
forgive edmond forgive for my sake who love you still the dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother	139.7901
porthos paid his compliments to m	83.5852
i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered	239.7008
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating dartagnan by a look	109.7666
he remained there some time alone	139.8214
_ma foi_ captain replied the sentry i do not know for the last hour i have not heard him stir come in your excellency said vampa	57.4863
perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me art thou happy friend asked dartagnan	186.2039
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing i said dartagnan nothing and he read you have not answered my first note	79.7907
in case i should be killed said de guiche	39.3368
chapter lxii	52.7275
let us see said dartagnan	7.5408
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness	188.4894
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same	97.8309
there go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred m chapter	224.4608
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him	106.9535
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side	82.7711
i	nan
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurators wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st leu being not far from that locality	89.2723
no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame de villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m	92.8806
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling	94.3114
trembling and awestruck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth	142.3542
let us put down added albert smiling	102.3484
i will so advantageously bestow piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino and during that year another skilfully placed piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison and do you feel sure of succeeding _pardieu_ exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french	287.6428
felton said milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to you	103.2315
i yesterday took the place of another	218.2341
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please it was three oclock in the afternoon	74.0880
dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him	61.2484
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly	165.0622
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous	95.0159
then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle	96.1614
this fashion is coming in	176.6067
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered	101.1338
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse	256.4028
tomorrow morning i start for paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent	71.6549
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to	127.0164
do so	942.3572
i	nan
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	77.3213

ah there you are my good darminges i have given you a great fright have i not	69.1653
excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets _morbleu_ by the streets cried franz	90.8434
then he thought he was going to die	13.6369
the count stopped on seeing the young man	21.0819
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation	85.9287
de morcerf will kill me morrel looked at him in utter amazement	52.3296
everywhere	nan
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions	162.9100
come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo	57.3967
is it broken off yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor indeed	272.3364
come exclaimed aramis	119.0810
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy not i	133.1832
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance	527.9490
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to ones patrons i hope to be captain without that said dantès	109.9974
you dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said porthos	146.8757
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer	50.0908
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of	54.2009
act prudently oh do not fear besides you will accompany me	140.0806
de villefort for three months he took not a step outofdoors without my following him	174.5151
keep your illhumor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it	188.3027
for the story	110.8950
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	58.9623
that is your road excellency and now you cannot again mistake and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money	216.2814
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockworkan ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of _the little versailles_	144.3979
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said come despatch the dying shall you go then albert asked franz	235.6803
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten oclock and the queen at what time is it her wish to start at midnight then it is possible	83.0014
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other hand	151.8731
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there	201.6816
is god m above us all sir was monte cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered	279.9367
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him but men are changed by events there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine	123.4961
m pretty strong rum said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve	110.8636
the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help what is the matter asked monte cristo	161.1667
this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred ironsided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place	172.7087
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters arrest	50.1036
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with	164.0372
a hatchet	3887.5461
they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are	81.8686
sir we dont keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay dealers where is the hay dealers at the last large door in the street are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw yes theres the landlord of the lamb and groslouis the farmer they both live in the rue	146.1109
des ursulines very well dartagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each	120.1640
de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect	149.7043
i missed her by twenty minutes at st omer	175.5842
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water	77.8462
porthos bowed to his friend	23.3420
he would not however yield immediately to the young mans request but made a few conscientious objections	163.2914
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not he is really out sir replied baptistin	88.1769
halfpast twelve he said	80.6685
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse	179.3002
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence	246.9891
how do you feel this morning he inquired	59.8624
there is no harm in overprecaution	52.2664
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace	137.6806
dartagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since then said athos in a tone of delight he is well	60.1602
athos who heard miladys voice came sharply up	304.5786
if he is herethis is what the other man saidlets see decidedly what to do with him what to do with him answered the prince	120.1023
nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself	154.6632
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	122.5538
discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france	182.4690
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of m	54.3741
de tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment	27.6926
accordingly dartagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him	162.2386
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count	150.6979
spoke ali turned pale and held down his head	47.9570
why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother	204.8587
as for me i am sure of it said the duke	10.3936
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire horrible cried de winter the daughter of henry iv and the wife of king charles wherefore did you	156.9035
not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle dorleans was spoken of said de winter	188.9443
_diable_ said morcerf	51.6483
for heavens sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessfor heavens sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch what am ithe law	219.7862
the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants	134.8573
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur	121.0617
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding	265.9175
ten minutes elapsed during which dartagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second	72.4293
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today dantès made no reply	115.6094
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks	299.4478
the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world	111.8396
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companions halfreproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile	201.4522
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him	68.7437
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself exactly therefore i think of sending him away from here you will be wise to do so no doubt of it but it will break his heart	92.2606
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old why not	162.8997
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title	42.4516

my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from heaven well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you i must again excuse myself m	127.0611
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veinspassion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader pleases	302.1010

but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore	615.2704
the young man appeared on the threshold of the ministers closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter	45.8790

cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing	127.0581

lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her	49.1890
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands	103.0438
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone	62.9995
dartagnan looked much disconcerted	341.1736
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste certainly sirit is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the antechamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening	128.8337
said aramis so we give it up and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments	135.5268

the hospital and learned that the same nightthe night of the th of septembera child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half	224.8861
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces	151.0385

de villefort and valentine at the same time	17.8669
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison in prison said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison ever since	243.6671

he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning	96.5408
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly dartagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as	201.1652
almost to rival porthos	609.7297
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king	72.3732
it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the th the francs of m	128.1355
his majesty king louis xiii	191.1479
i am ready said he	21.4603
but for the honor of the kingof the queen well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen	48.0955
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	84.2673
the floor of the abbés cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the completion	81.3600
and clement vii but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work	353.0053
jussac fell like a dead mass	224.2973
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked caderousse	110.0169

and come back immediately barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which valentine had filled	172.6932
what our enemies say of us is then true	147.3027
as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments	372.6670

this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers	417.3915
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne	45.1055
davrigny	nan
but the prince de marsillac yes indeed thats the right thing	162.5512
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos	86.7763
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses	164.4260
the friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of pierrefonds to which porthos escorted his friend	101.4730
there is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe	127.2074
are you ill inquired the young man much alarmed	48.0871
de villefort	4.0417
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns	96.4934
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color	202.8446

but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect	125.7366
the carriage rolled rapidly onward	482.5609
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other	86.0458
i am on the point of starting on a journey replied morrel disdainfully	106.9712
ah cried porthos would i were but a baron well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken	118.9506
i will join you again at marseilles well be it solet us part said mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere	197.7063
i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses beauchamp will never retract then we must fight no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name we will fight nevertheless	168.0738
chapter xli	64.1982
indeed said dartagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy	179.4604
but replied felton i wish to know do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true christians are forbidden to lie well then said felton i will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind	65.5276
de villefort and then ask me for proofs everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails	111.4784
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a _calotte_ was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio	196.6371
if it is a snare replied dartagnan i shall scent it out be assured	100.3123
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation	124.5334
to the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal to the _soubrette_ she had given the heart of a duchess	105.7228
it was as we have said the st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness	73.6120
come then said dartagnan you are right	9.4467
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtiers expression could not be understood	95.3895
de morcerf	9.9233
what are you doing reverend sir	30.5006
ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond	112.9539
he walked to the window and looked into the court	31.8172
it is said that mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of austriala portes memoirs	224.5478
the dark space frightened her	1281.2880
explain it athos groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself dartagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	879.6996
mark i see you now	25.6846
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes	102.0639
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure	50.6266
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone	22.4189
alberts lips scarcely whispered goodbye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	488.5110
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed	93.9832
in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides	144.9238
grimaud made the sign yes	68.3495
porthos my friend said dartagnan dont distrust providence let me meditate and consider meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn	192.6919
but what brings you here his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you i only arrived yesterday and what have you been doing since yesterday i have not lost my time oh i dont doubt that do you know whom i have encountered here no guess how can i that young woman whom the queen took out of prison the mistress	92.5880
of that fellow dartagnan yes madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this woman does she know you no then she looks upon you as a	207.6445
stranger milady smiled	680.9974
laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a run	304.4115
the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprisedfor in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte	57.0479
emmanuel accompanied me father	835.0151
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken	56.9380
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc	360.7704
i said the novice	96.1603
where am i said she	47.0971
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	153.9069
ifaith no said dartagnan i was not in voice monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either	78.5344
now then to play another masterstroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wifedelightful still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugénie danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make	103.2703
if on the other side it was not shewhich was still quite possiblefor the little light that remained rendered a mistake easymight it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known	125.3263
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongsan officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah but if i mistake not continued he here he is you wont forget the boy sir raoul put his hand in his pocket	157.6166
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	148.7673
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn	315.7946
old dantès however sprang forward	379.0192
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti danglars kept up the title of prince	96.3907
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the allées de meilhan	123.6417
my dear m	18.4887
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took	108.8709
yes what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer	35.4916
a light cloud passed over the counts face	61.1283
i am of dartagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat	79.4144
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii	112.4470
are you a doctor yes the best you could have at the present time believe me but you say you have watched said valentine uneasily where have you beeni have not seen you the count extended his hand towards the library	80.0223
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes	406.3133
this was granted	114.9367
on what was dartagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling	237.6155
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal	175.5454
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her thank you sir said davrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it	91.0168
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken	142.3767
and in whose behalf are you looking for them you are in no doubt on that score that is true unfortunately i have no idea where they are and you have no way to get news of them	63.7575
no he went out early this morning replied the valet	129.6144
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense	270.2935
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to lepee du grand henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us there the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated	181.0547
m	nan
are you not married asked the countess	18.1242
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat	102.9895
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be	159.0125
when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day	120.3949
a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed	95.1679
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	14.1989
if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the abbé busoniin all probability we shall never see him well then so i will said caderousse so you may have the diamond for francs	94.3284
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart	47.9956
another gasconade murmured the gentleman	404.6808
haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in arabic	154.3663
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle	71.6116
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted	175.7627
let us return to my ring or rather to yours	41.7801
dartagnans penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost	109.0962
i fear an attack myself after all these disasters oh man murmured davrigny the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the earth turns the sun shines and death strikes for him alonean ant cursing god from the top of a blade of grass and have those who have lost their lives lost nothingm	338.5463
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	216.9445
what was most clear in the matter was that dartagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all	59.4524
he is going to fall cried morrel	68.2317
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	63.7176
dartagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently	73.3643
dartagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration	185.7131
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied you mean george villiers asked felton whose looks became excited	395.3152
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto	112.9483
at least dartagnan said to himself as he took the road to villarscotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking	51.2638
the beggar chapter	310.2996
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant	153.9371
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy	36.0127
yes happy as myself said he	165.6314
she is very amiable then is she not said albert	100.3314
had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct that is reasonable since he is an only son well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten	243.9072
de villefort	4.0417
unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twentyfive pistoles for which he had given his word	68.5687
ah i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	221.7003
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future	148.5704
it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave	130.5419
monte cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawingroom	48.9861
yes yes to mine gad he was not so proud thenhe was an underclerk to the good m	191.4213
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	105.4546
valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtiers look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind	109.1450
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted	119.3907
i believe these fellows have managed their business	221.0276
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said davrigny since she is dead deaddead groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man	107.9829
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion	198.7850
indeed madame you believe me too credulous confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage i invent nothing madame i create nothing	159.1989
what shall we do said athos	26.9796
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	87.6436
cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard	106.3313
gracious me said porthos theres phoebus ruined the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles im above that let us set out again at full gallop yes if we can but at last the lieutenants horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall	152.5809
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible	169.9720
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	117.6974
charless heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death	54.5532
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more	139.1228
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose	221.4541
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe	90.7092
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for dartagnan	100.9372
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said come aramis now for the honor of france and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded	207.9177
dartagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared	70.2226
yes continued the cardinal	28.4044
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed	114.1724
when he was completely dressed he said send hither monsieur dartagnan the valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before one might have fancied him an apparition	103.2744
you have lived three years in paris	48.0195
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer yes much said dartagnan who did not well know how to answer	148.0175
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso	70.6203
i have told you and i repeat it that tonight we rescue charles i	79.1661
see if he is still in the same place athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole	89.2440
beware of a profane taste in your theological style	288.2931
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs i will accompany you but however near it may be replied dartagnan i cannot go thither in this guise thats true said athos and he rang the bell	45.8860
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start	99.7399
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity	51.0530
it is my dear valentine said the baroness that you are doubtless suffering m i said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead	44.7060
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war	83.2697
no but franz has for heavens sake not a word of this before him	142.7637
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée dantin no the others are on the mantlepiece of your excellencys bedroom good what oclock is it four oclock monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerfs and then	119.0280
he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way	79.1621
we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared	139.6988
all has gone according to my wishes	220.4337
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur dartagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment	75.4977
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	48.7015
through the grating however dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saintlaurent and the rue taramis to the quay	51.8051
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemens coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door	117.2878
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirtyfive years of age	358.5685
come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at once lucien a great event has happened said the lady glancing inquiringly at lucienm	301.1065
the light of day reassured me i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow	110.1394
repeat it repeat it cried dartagnan it will make a little change not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse the devil said dartagnan	102.9681
there only they explained to them the matter in hand	188.0397
i can be useful in one way onlyif knowledge of parisian habits of the means of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here	181.3095
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order	68.2799
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder	55.8620
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared	74.2959
in conscience i cannot kill him and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me	122.9014
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to france for a thousand pistoles said the captain	59.0458
i come for your commands my lord he said	56.1110
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain	117.9659
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans face	202.5589
at ten oclock the kings collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers	67.3086
m	nan
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag	142.7747
do you know what torture is	33.4785
monsieur said he as long as i hold him in this manner he cant cry ill be bound but as soon as i let go he will howl again	118.4600
_diable_ he said after having swallowed the divine preserve	169.4453
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive you think then that i may rely on the counts promises certainly i do you are sure he will keep his word with me to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts	72.0007
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them	193.9985
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll	428.0905
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it indeed my dear friend said m	116.5073
you too have been in england sir he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order	69.4615
should we not do better in the grottos what grottos why the grottoscaves of the island i do not know of any grottos replied jacopo	126.7891
i have eight men on guard you know	122.3424
well happily i dont say nay to it	312.4053
instinctively fernand drew back his chair	103.9917
fatality he muttered	130.2744
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was satisfied	72.9611
the count of monte cristo cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage i should think we would see him	38.5782
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year	120.7597
to no purpose cried dantès	378.0463
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe	85.7011
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him what did you refuse to dine with him said old dantès and did he invite you to dine yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his fathers astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son	70.2485
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine	117.5538
besides kitty will tell nothing will you kitty	262.3317
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching	89.6768
he proposed to fernand to accompany him fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general	109.7195
de villefort	4.0417
the cardinals replied mme	1064.6221
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said groslow	68.4482
how was he going to find athos	34.5782
well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately why what is the matter it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all	121.4697
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir	65.6685
is the baroness at home inquired danglars	109.3400
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them	92.1680
julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs that completes the francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains	107.2668
chapter lxiii	45.5889
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers thats true said dantès but the corridor you speak of only bounds _one_ side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished	212.4295
with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	277.5689
de morcerfs who is deceased for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired and what are they to live upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army m well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not muchfrom twelve to thirteen	298.4915
hundred thousand francs	4.0637
three of the four horses had already arrived	40.3908
rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow i understand replied fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine	116.8783
coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband	80.8410
m the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the	136.9342
fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation	168.8314
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead you make me tremble said the young girl	95.2947
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter	50.5108
he went to desire you to come to the palace	85.4835
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them	82.6240
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there	230.7965
dartagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively	82.9342
the bandits laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings	334.2922
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital yes monseigneur you came through meung where something befell you	99.1094
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded	109.0024
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemiesthe faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin	60.2234
but that is not all	24.8018
two months and a half elapsed in these trips and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other	144.1302
isnt it reasonable yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonableit was noble and generous	166.8796
the prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant	159.9255
informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the kings countenance m	61.0334
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	61.2444
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window	157.5713
to own the truth i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes a droll way of showing your affliction the duke meant to say affection but my lord returned la ramee what would you do if you got out	143.3578
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness	101.9726
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed	47.6140
in addition to this dartagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de tréville he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without	124.7075
a window surrounded by barren fieldsan accessory to the preauxclercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose	122.4225
months and years rolled on	878.7467
de beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what i ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer	527.0327
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today yes your excellency but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late oh no answered franz i had no such intention and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle i might have	120.7832
done so from monte pincio could i not ah exclaimed mine host i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves very possibly i may not go answered franz but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars	253.7981
of todays executions what particulars would your excellency like to hear why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to die that happens just lucky your excellency only a few minutes ago they brought me the _tavolettas_ what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before	202.1733
an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment	289.9535
you dont love me	67.7356
he comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions	134.7608
the two friends repaired to athoss and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them	172.3131
morrel	nan
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil	165.8631
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin	197.6120
haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel	86.4001
and if i give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it by my honor by the faith of a gentleman said dartagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it	69.1411
exactly he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story m andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hares paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable illtemper	108.1975
i can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon the substitute for monsieur dartagnan still holds his place the two friends looked at each other	92.7470
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation	129.6724
yes keep itkeep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures	193.7356
treat him kindly therefore in the future captain said the young king to dartagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner todayyou and your friend the baron du vallon that was a great honor for dartagnan and for porthos	114.8741
they were one in the rue de vaugirard no the other in the rue de la harpe no does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested it will be too late they will be gone but still we can make sure that they are so take ten men of my guardsmen and search the two houses thoroughly instantly monseigneur and rochefort	102.9347
went hastily out of the apartment	64.2448
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell and are you going to leave me at such a time this very instant and where are you going ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service ah me ah me have you any letters for	101.8845
me inquired dartagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief	186.1142
but the third time which is the present you may succumb	91.7463
the monks eyes glittered	4570.1982
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything because she was in fear of being arrested why has she not written to me then because she was afraid of compromising you dartagnan you restore me to life cried aramis	71.8844
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel	57.4255
aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion he cast his eyes again on the letter	108.7675
you are therefore your own master till seven oclock in the evening but at seven oclock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses there said planchet	72.8012
de tréville looking earnestly at dartagnan	55.1600
the woman is an agent of the cardinal he has agents then throughout the world cried dartagnan	88.7629
dartagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen	63.2414
why oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain with spain no answered dartagnan but paris what do you mean cried rochefort	133.4525
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained	322.6964
sheathe then if you please and follow us monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossiblemonsieur de tréville has forbidden it	130.4324
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris pshaw pshaw i cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very	90.3957
well let us say no more about it	26.7673
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort the world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile hate you sweet valentine	155.2043
exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmothers aversion to me arises from a very natural sourceher overweening love for her own child my brother edward but why should it i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation	141.0893
i will just say this muchthat her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m	170.9807
de winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed all	240.7698
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	50.1103
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republics which deputed david to devise a uniform for the academicians indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician within the last week he has been	127.9325
made one of the learned assembly and what is his especial talent his talent	186.9950
one now and then i dont say much about but seven in two days i repeat it is too many it is far too many therefore sire your majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their excuses quite contrite and repentant hem said the king	163.2528
but now he said that you are a widower your wifes connection cannot injure you yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the de courcys who were content to be plain sirs or the rohans who didnt wish to be dukes all these people who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in	229.9427
all the ceremonies and i can say nothing to them	88.4288
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much	76.9055
money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand	109.2765
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an illbred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it	135.4982
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less	99.2843
both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced	147.3454
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb	167.1354
i will take charge of the inside one	153.5433
the miserable villain he had foreseen all	348.4734
men are so made and we are not always twenty years old	82.8265
you are here said she	23.2551
whywhat do you mean by that question i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these	60.4112
the two guards led in athos	123.9882
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him	53.8207
but how do you know all this how do i know it yes how do you know it	21.3215
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape dartagnan appeared to authorize the issue	182.5188
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	281.8699
what can i do for the son	36.6762
paris is a horrible place in summer	129.5501
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah	127.6583
ah said dartagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold	84.2051
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her	25.1250
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father haydée became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord haydée haydée you are young and beautiful forget even my name and be happy it is well said haydée your order shall be executed my	112.9129
lord i will forget even your name and be happy and she stepped back to retire	111.0124
no one can say that m	31.3502
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door	92.5026
now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are	47.7425
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young mans frame	101.0063
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you	66.5479
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup together	214.0679
alas sir no and i do not know what has become of him so that i am really so unhappy that i weep in fact tears rolled down his cheeks	45.6732
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements	113.0316
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve i understand said athos smiling midnight about that time but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return if you do not return how does it concern you	125.5741
his resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some food	123.3978
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste of course i have well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence	155.2266
he derived his picturesque name	1161.1244
monsieur porthos monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife	28.2042
yes but your father died in your arms happy respected rich and full of years his father died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards his tomb had disappeared and no one could say there sleeps the father you so well loved oh exclaimed morrel	216.5720
m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him	152.9500
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him	141.6384
she is amiable and wellbehaved what is her name she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty	107.6470
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his hands	365.6626
let one of us put on the dress and mount the kings horse	96.7154
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then	109.2261
were and i held my tongue	145.0694
dartagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described	77.1714
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god we need no proofs everything relating to this young man is true a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay	206.8329
two words from the hand of your majesty and your private seal but these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile yes if they fell into infamous hands	230.4593
accepted the money said dartagnan	48.7656
what news exclaimed a general burst of voices	504.2910
the citizen followed him	100.8676
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m	188.5041
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone	194.4598
yesif i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right	73.4549
it is quite wonderful said albert	56.6048
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	82.2858
throw myself in the water and strangle him oh gentlemen cried athos be men be christians see death is depicted on his face ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse grant me this poor wretchs life	193.1972
you see it is yourself who have first named heryou her father have pity on valentine listen it is impossible	185.3009
our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes	88.5423
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the wormeaten table which with the stool and the goatskin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell	100.3939
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box	80.5006
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the cardinal	91.6555
de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès	71.4743
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the	90.1081
ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke dangouleme were called the petitsmaitres	551.9232
no dont be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured	52.4283
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming red	149.8325
franz to do with it	63.5806
athos sighed deeply	331.7695
explain yourself more clearly i beg sir oh make yourself easyi am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean	170.5042
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty bearing	256.7032
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin	197.6120
as for me i can only repeat may god protect you and all dear to you sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin the host was at his door and everything was preparedbed bandages and lint and a groom had gone to lens the nearest village for a doctor	133.9374
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why	161.3700
do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile	149.4113
people cry out long live the king down with mazarin thats nothing new no weve been used to those acclamations for some time and you sing chorus replied guitant laughing	362.0229
first one gunl goes under then the other	420.7731
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways you will take your musketoon and your pistols there now didnt i say so cried planchet	113.1770
at six oclock lord de winter came in	24.0778
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	122.9125
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon	184.2214
tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though my friend urban grandier wasnt a sorcerer he was a learned man	420.9835
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well are we softened a little	162.0093
i am getting more and more seasick go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet	313.3476
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pontneuf lucien half smiled	299.7636
chapter xxiv	1217.8593
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket the casket would encumber you	166.7884
shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess	74.0716
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling	59.8268
i have done and dartagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis	28.4381
look fernand your eyes are better than mine	201.6744
he thought the carriage was about to stop there	41.7327
you know about that cried athos astonished	92.9004
morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last halfhour to tell me that if his ship the _pharaon_ did not come into port on the th he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed	155.9552
m	nan
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present	115.2999
by the light of one of these torches dartagnan perceived men in uniform	128.4180
morrel said he in a low voice you send us away you are then angry with us no no said m	52.7656
he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle	133.0374
and you asked porthos havent you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligentwhat then is his name planchetyes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer what is he then with his sixteen hundred francsyou remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord	145.9694
de winterhe has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards how does it happen then that he is in your service he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchets adventure	78.2130
the kings musketeers and the cardinals guards dartagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris	55.3530
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed	52.8014
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time mme	116.1701
how can you find out you shall see gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land	135.0336
the masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors	83.9664
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led dartagnan into it	54.8401
these individuals are under arrest	975.8309
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastilewhere he remained for twelve long yearswhen his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave	95.1522
only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court	165.9060
we know him said athos he never left the king yes that is he	49.1393
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe	266.5379
yes for an instant i hoped it was so	38.7860
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied athos	308.6101
pray let me know who you really are the stranger smiled a melancholy smile	96.8551
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks	196.3689
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your motherinlaw madame de saintméran heard her	81.2730
no and yet they refused to buy it why said châteaurenaud	134.2297
they were only fit for a young man i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriagehorses and i do not think they were dear	87.5269
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion	127.0870
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers	569.6775
your majesty wishes then you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply	54.7499
what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m	71.1109
de tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the bastille	137.8822
hem said dartagnan what does my lord think of that reply man of talent cried mazarin	106.2711
de morcerf on account of loving another i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject	159.9905
in a moment they were at the canebière	40.9862
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast	107.8782
oh very shortly madame said he but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day	84.0136
let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father	178.8433
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light	92.8317
i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state oh mother murmured renée	137.6511
m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions	348.8125
who said valentine was dead the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstricken	60.5272
oh cried the inspector who can live here a most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute he is alone certainly how long has he been there nearly a year was he placed here when he first arrived no not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his	164.8287
food to him to kill the turnkey yes the very one who is lighting us	152.1160
and with whom with whom can it be if not the duke of the duke of yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice	153.3102
yes said he	6.7947
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness	62.3793
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude	119.1217
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everythingyou are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni	95.1105
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it	64.5828
and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes	129.9949
to donate please visit	11240.4629
alas no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristos question and alberts answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it monte cristo reflected one instant	265.0858
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor	56.9203
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself halffainting into a chair	68.1658
he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses	143.8948
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different affair yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that inot in the least i beg you to believe	96.8207
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters	247.5932
mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saintméran took and madame de saintméran is dead	96.5966
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule	76.7594
and you have succeeded exclaimed davrigny	128.2963
where is the countwhere is haydée look said jacopo	304.9344
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos	189.9829
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman ah old woman screamed nanette	689.9300
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of dartagnan	127.3918
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls	209.7230
the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the prince de conti the brother of the prince de condé and the duc de longueville his brotherinlaw	100.2964
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	66.1371
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied dartagnan not to lead ones neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them dartagnan smiledhe was just the man to understand the astute italian	165.9697
what is it asked he	9.4217
sir said madame de saintméran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged your intended soninlaw is named m	106.9580
we shall be carried in triumph in fact as we have said the whole camp was in motion	74.8089
dartagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms sake	240.9364
in fact the rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before	63.7228
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed dartagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her	130.1746
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor	491.6285
well has anybody come out no but somebody has gone in a man or a woman a man ah ah said dartagnan there are two of them then i wish there were four said athos the two parties would then be equal perhaps there are four said dartagnan	116.0112
i will then release you from all your promiseseven that of procuring my admission into the musketeers for before everything i wish to avenge myself beware young man cried tréville	170.0076
at nine oclock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m	103.9906
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace	105.9756
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced	66.0469
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleons downfall	318.6629
i am her best friend upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here no they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen indeed and who dartagnan and his friends indeed	106.0061
they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille why is it not done already what would you	42.9053
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornélie her confidential maid	126.8436
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world	144.4651
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes	228.3403
you sent for me he said to the prisoner	29.3278
m you understand me said the count	15.9629
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	143.1732
keep the purse for your lackeys dartagnan put the purse into his pocket	66.9050
i am ready to speak my lord ah ah said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that	36.2183
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted	46.1514
oh that is very goodindeed it is very good said louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envywill they go under a mans hat like the one i see down there you shall see said eugénie	116.5910
there i will indicate to you the best place and time the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while dartagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmesdeschaux saying to himself decidedly i cant draw back but at least if i am killed i shall be killed by a musketeer	108.7646
chapter v	50.0064
come come madame cried dartagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	80.2073
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked dartagnan	69.3539
the monk exclaimed grimaud	426.4814
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired	82.0622
they were making nearly ten knots an hour	111.0427
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny	77.4569
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation	163.3420
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife	231.9585
a tigress a panther ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us dartagnan then related allthe mad passion of milady and her menaces of death	235.6260
in an instant dantès plan was formed	226.2750
whose then is the air we breathe	478.2794
lovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips	366.2899
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m	115.5391
every one stood up	123.8957
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner	83.9817
we did not see her monseigneur said athos	50.1091
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo	33.6310
at this moment a patrol passed by	47.7087
oh leave me said i	94.2552
come then said the minister i will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied dartagnan	70.1335
never exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never i swear before god who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you	256.5627
lord de winter exclaimed the count	6.2902
dartagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	70.5822
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivains respectful inquiry about	234.6099
the cause of so much fixed attention	261.0936
dartagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts	272.5626
de villefort i beseech your indulgence for him villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism	148.7949
we did not see his companion come out he may have gone by the other door what is he doing putting on his cloak and gloves hes ours muttered dartagnan	114.9883
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo	40.4659
was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up	70.6348
he took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his finger	39.7535
heres an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby	292.5519
the conversation took place in englisha language which dartagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage	91.8535
the bandits shouted with laughter	956.4503
i am brother to parry his majestys lackey athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the kings tent	81.6697
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moments notice	103.1056
oh the red duke bravo bravo the red duke cried porthos clapping his hands and nodding his head	125.1740
why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother	49.3909
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark	122.8794
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes he must have one said athos	137.3058
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear usfor i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the same	89.3917
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god	171.5727
the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon	185.4081
why is that gendarme there asked andrea of himself	161.4810
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense	45.5296
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade	361.4914
there said he demand thy child of carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions	101.9102
i am at quite a loss how to answer you i admit said mme	158.1166
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams	96.1128
but the lady asked porthos	134.0365
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from noyon in picardy you have several lawsuits and no attorney	233.1675
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke	110.7814
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness	310.2541
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	138.8063
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello	53.1044
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	301.0107
open sir she said and look for yourself mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	185.3542
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied dartagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come said dartagnan aloud i have no motive for defending monsieur	97.5836
confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host	59.4026
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time still no answer	144.2021
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	279.5324
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx	150.9330
i am condemned leave me to my death my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an executioner what do you mean asked the king	103.2027
i have no right to it	59.4338
you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven	61.5436
fernand went and mercédès remained alone	159.5062
de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison	453.9654
for one second dartagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and dartagnan recognized the coadjutor	78.1982
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her	117.7525
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide	133.4035
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder	104.0441
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself	82.0147
pardon you monseigneur you cannot mean that ah my dear monsieur bonacieux you are generous in this matter	87.0510
i heard the chevalier dherblay say so the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures	236.5914
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	147.2487
but this planchet is so serious and important that i have not informed my friends that i would entrust this secret to you and for a captains commission i would not write it be satisfied monsieur said planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty	84.2010
leagues in order to take the post planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers but otherwise as lighthearted as possible	137.3974
monsieur maninahurry you can find me without running_me_ you understand and where i pray you near the carmesdeschaux at what hour about noon about noon	191.8893
well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham you shall not do that dartagnan said athos coolly	40.1175
ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made	36.5612
indeed thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry clerksfor the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousins place i would not keep such gourmands they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks m	250.4515
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m	103.7480
the petition finished villefort read it aloud	623.4178
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it	107.7190
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself	122.7163
you think then said he that i am taken to the château dif to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m	81.8027
de châteaurenaud m	192.9447
some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch	3601.9924
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees	62.6050
there the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed	132.8502
chapter xi	449.4918
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial	43.3992
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see what asked athos	94.1589
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m	84.5185
living my best friends would avoid my house dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home	200.1996
and i _idem_ said aramis	100.6518
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed	175.0008
yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity	65.7724
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered	144.2062
the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and	139.0606
despair in your heart	38.7469
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him	103.7703
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubtedthe inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death	138.4208
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around	60.8211
without doubt aramis is one of my best friends aramis who is he come come you wont tell me you dont know aramis this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced it is the first time then that you ever went to that house undoubtedly and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man no by	60.3555
a musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the world	75.3831
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucienoh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgers name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a doorkeeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife	119.4823
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars _née_ hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friends conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the counts talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess	210.5440
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by gods	139.3860
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position	157.7372
dandré cried de blacas	144.3025
it was now nine oclock	33.2764
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket you see then said dartagnan that i must have that letter	55.7431
dartagnan a difficult commission my lord replied dartagnan resuming his serious manner	309.8218
i inherit my fathers name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it	97.9568
he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions yes signified the	100.4187
old man	5.2426

the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base	371.6838

from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in horror you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord	88.7697
de winter is not capable of such a crime good said milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything whom do you call _that wretch_ asked felton	113.4700
everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose	92.8657

go to blin or véronique for your clothes	295.2419
your name is celebrated your position magnificent and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine	146.5009

before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in	80.4222
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow	66.6794
she escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at boulogne without accident	170.0652

monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina	58.4150
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you	22.8134
felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers	46.8060
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz	128.3084
there is a struggle in nature against this divine substancein nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain	168.1594
the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price	75.8861

after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission	92.4011
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars	117.8371
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse	202.4312
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer	223.7299
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man	100.6175
of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo	385.0392
my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask at that	78.8250
instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head	103.3622
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance	102.7327
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countesss visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you	190.5519
must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme m and you will probably find your	126.5384
theme illchosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	363.9071
peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened	308.8647
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	273.4608
you have not played for a long time dartagnan and i have no inclination to play swear to nothing	58.5632
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers actions	619.7221

cromwell gazed a moment after him	104.6116
this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo busoni	262.0338
he was now as we have said threeandthirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance	65.0420
and you you dartagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners	268.4889

but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table	107.2303
i am expiating a moment of selfishness and so i always say to la carconte when she complains hold your tongue woman it is the will of god and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance	171.6025
just now dartagnan continued you were disguisedi mean to say attiredas a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered oh sir said dartagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to	76.0624
be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question	277.6526
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own affairs	78.7385

the hundred days chapter	336.5475
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomasdulouvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which	87.5033

and whose horses are these cried dartagnan	275.0869
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind franz smiled an instant after the count entered	117.0370

and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you	92.7304
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majestys principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend	78.9910
that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles	666.8909
they took their places and the ballet began	68.1021

my son i bless thee the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old mans bed	56.3235

he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces	130.1987
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate	52.1155
to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	172.4203
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered	124.0955

after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni	88.5726

as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which	122.8113
like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	152.5203

de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day	59.3391

the return dartagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation	159.3550

some days before the return of the emperor fernand was drafted	89.9307
then dartagnan became almost wild	512.5020

but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfs narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	239.8634
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so	187.7216

it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of	69.3242
the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	300.8775

i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air	54.4852
the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance	51.7318
i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the	111.3562
interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	82.0780

villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter	52.2341
i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal but woe to those who stood in my pathway m enough said mercédès enough edmond believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you like the gulf	237.8291
between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures	124.7281

under the other cardinal continued dartagnan we didnt know enough to make our profits this however doesnt concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me porthos sighed	115.3941
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly	168.5084
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise	82.7990

as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	162.9964
alas monsieur said she that is too bad what the devil do you see so bad in it said dartagnan	41.9785
we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child	108.8196

it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed	347.6273
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man	202.2802
ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets i fear that is true said dartagnan in a low tone	38.7637
thats right said athos put your other hand here and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers	173.7904

but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	100.4362
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats chapter lxxvi	361.1322

on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling	134.0292
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	81.1458
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire	271.5308
there is a third and the most terriblethat is my condition as a mortal being	88.9704
athos glanced at aramis	50.5621

you have no money coming in on which you can rely none you have exhausted every resource all and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored blood washes out dishonor said morrel	189.1999

they were playing together as usual when seven oclock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts	154.7713

no said dartagnan no i confess it	52.0324
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us	333.8889

decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal	460.9429
marvelous that falls out oddly three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman	448.0529

that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me	67.4506

tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one oclock in the morning	121.3427
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace	359.1278
afterward mme	224.6131
he now determined not to begin the game with dartagnan till he knew completely all his adversarys cards	237.2790
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an illbred man	260.1051

this time you will lay your plans more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape	171.3097
morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow	146.8960

and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances dartagnan was the only man who could relieve the queens uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to	123.4353
announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur dartagnan at once	74.3617

you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here	83.5827

he pushed the door open and entered	29.8130
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees	126.1777

the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question	258.7303
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest	102.8707
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and reembarked for marciana	179.2755
why i was here only ten or twelve days ago	51.5760
m	nan
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror	103.5926
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	238.6903
you are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircasemust not one speak of that a little my lord diavolo cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands	270.8304
i am a lost and ruined man but without listening to his protestations of alarm dartagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall	64.9750
here are thirty francs i will sleep at the _cheval rouge_ and will secure a place in the first coach	100.8529
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	39.9698
the pleasure of seeing you	148.2793
well said the president your name i cannot tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my fathers and can tell it to you a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand	69.1208
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love	208.1070
grimaud bowed but stepped back	133.4434
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him	93.4305
he rose however as they approached	197.0326

the third then fell from the clouds i suppose no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master or his mistress interrupted dartagnan	112.9035
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest	179.6979

the counts tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere	201.5877
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air	80.7972
_pardieu_ gentlemen said he	12.4693
what is he looking at	24.6375
we will have him informed that his sisterinlaw is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her	73.6691

he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance	86.4884
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination what is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand	79.1192
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre	82.9116
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators m it is a conspiracy then asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm	118.0908
a little farthera little farther said the other	179.5304
but let us wait a little and reflect	68.5410
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now	55.5861
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life	163.8382
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny	269.4587
zounds cried aramis i may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat apropos i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen	151.3644
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m	70.1789
diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh	243.3912
twentythree thousand francs said she	14.1903
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy and by the rapid glance that the young mans eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness	180.5734
the evening arrived all paris was in expectation	199.8030
look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy bloodcolored drapery and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen villefort became livid madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney	172.0726
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon	105.4454
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and miladys every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other thats exactly the reason i wont go said dartagnan	120.0814
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends i do not know my lord	35.4436
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated	97.8518
say the devil my dear friend said dartagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say oh gentlemen said the host i have been wrong	56.4711
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver	111.7122
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand	39.4796
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos echoing dartagnans sigh	140.2851
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawingroom	179.3768
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winters neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereigns confidence and friendship	120.8144
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the contract the baron was to sign first then the representative of m	156.1505
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door	37.1198
at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of august and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes	62.8551
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud	186.0520
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry and i am so still said porthos bowing to harrison	112.1600
i ridiculous	50995.3164
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england	41.4318
chapter xx	49.5048
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	45.0076
does he think we are going to take him in	15.1633
_allegro_ he called out to the postilions at every ascent	118.4386
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed	69.0722
dartagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul	147.6357
the fourth and last side of your cell faces onfaces onstop a minute now where does it face the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber	185.0434
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolenceswhich even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastropheswere seen to be utterly futile	142.1427
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her	61.6142
yes i did waityes i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me	116.5747
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties dartagnan would become the preserver of his friends	367.3710
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the travelers abandoning his purse to save his life	89.6059
albert de morcerf	20.1586
i havedoubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter	102.8548
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected	56.7455
dartagnan obeyed	409.6553
i never meddle in intrigues and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret mazarin shook his head	130.8327
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira	162.4744
you understand athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m	148.7745
i am a sailor not a second was to be lost	46.1662
all day dantès walked up and down his cell	103.5390
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine bazin bowed low sighed and left the room	157.7363
at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_	115.1087
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing	122.3870
then while madame de saintméran remained on her knees praying fervently villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerfs	91.1086
besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than you i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days that is allto athos whose wound still makes him suffer to go to the waters of forges to porthos and aramis to accompany their friend whom they are not	77.8786
willing to abandon in such a painful condition	124.6058
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said ah the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioners axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently	147.0592
and christianly for you to return the blow and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on	124.5247
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m	56.2470
all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house	121.3080
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back a step or two but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place	81.7241
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle	155.3092
the valet de chambre appeared on the doorsteps	66.0500
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	102.6667
chapter xiii	77.7915
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	132.3870
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape	303.6048
goodevening comrade said dartagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner	98.8422
la chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la trémouille i wish to speak with him this evening your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la trémouille and myself nobody by the faith of a gentleman tomorrow then sire tomorrow monsieur at what oclock please your majesty at any hour	92.2652
you will but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty awaken me do you think i ever sleep then	127.3283
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you dartagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man oh thats very well young man continued m	142.4874
valentine looked at m	22.4635
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it	56.2181
it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example	321.7246
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchampas it sometimes we may say often happenswas his intimate friend	449.3855
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag	235.3786
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest m you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet feltyou are mistaken valentine dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger	167.1582
have you seen my mother asked albert	27.3441
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage	98.1591
bonacieux	nan
then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer but what are your intentions mercédès smiled sadly	150.6734
at this word athos and aramis jumped up	72.2231
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating ladys men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day the _bonnes fortunes_ of de tréville were talked of as those of m	217.6050
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	130.4866
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips	164.3593
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon	200.8709
so dartagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply	155.8124
all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished	104.3113
come come with me gentlemen exclaimed mazarin	40.3372
pardieu pass replied dartagnan	357.6827
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos	110.8249
ali returned a sign in the negative	76.4636
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation	115.4449
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale	75.4874
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself	130.4448
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king on the contrary i am certain he will do so	76.3839
but look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of athoss horse	87.9149
the bastion st gervais replied dartagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen was that affair hot yes moderately so	843.5381
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions	206.8182
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity	36.9902
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect	259.8331
morrel said dantès observing the owners impatience here is your supercargo m	407.9109
do you think they have recognized us said dartagnan	28.9678
_a propos_ monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger	71.4531
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained fortyeight hours without eating or drinking	212.1589
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents	131.4292
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont	56.5249
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the princess henrietta	196.1313
dartagnan said athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her shoulder how can i tell said dartagnan	117.3354
the whole world conspires to break our bonds	366.6096
oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door	66.7194
albert returned safelythen the count was revenged	241.7078
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude	321.7754
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said dartagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties_ and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans	105.5584
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed	217.8490
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union	361.4830
what do you think of that interrogator asked aramis	28.6755
as was his custom dartagnan presented himself at miladys at about nine oclock	211.1662
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man	97.1512
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him	108.2170
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground	59.9949
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly	101.4700
listen said he	5.4003
directly afterwards the moon rose	100.6815
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room	23.6941
what is that line	99.6781
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg sainthonoré	41.0369
you like m	444.4615
dartagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung	218.1497
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine oclock	73.1558
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take	105.0226
what is it the child conceals it but where did he find it in his mothers laboratory does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory how can i tell	125.2326
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of enghien	120.2709
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonderfor whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great i will not contradict you there said dartagnan	162.9537
dépinay return we expect him every moment it is well	242.3875
and he is very rich i am not so sure of that and yet you said he had money fifty thousand livresa mere trifle he is well educated hem said monte cristo in his turn	70.6594
if he tells the baron said she i am lostfor the baron who knows very well that i shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more beautiful	115.6270
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak	212.7052
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command	90.4010
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages	155.5081
where is he there in the salon	34.5156
there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force	262.9127
i asked you continued villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my fatherinlaw m	89.6329
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	114.7948
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him	73.6459
the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves	210.0925
well then let us say no more about it said dartagnan and let us burn this letter which no doubt announces to you some fresh infidelity of your _grisette_ or your chambermaid what letter cried aramis eagerly	90.4966
as to dartagnan he took care not to give the least sign of existence	43.6645
i suppose you mean continued dartagnan	72.7099
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened	212.7184
faria bent on him his penetrating eye	148.7312
the repast was magnificent monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests	138.5364
dartagnan vigorously seized his prisoners hand saying eh the king	387.0978
by the way said m	68.8529
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculousstupid you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit suicide	117.9540
planchet said dartagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one below	116.9288
who goes there	126.0767
and with his lackey he took the road to the governors country house	68.8419
is there any crime in this request no sire then you will appear yes sire that is well said the king retiring that is well i count upon it the queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her	150.2426
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief here i am said vampa instantly appearing what do you want take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocketbook and let me live here i ask no more for libertyi only ask to live then you suffer a great deal oh yes yes cruelly still there have been men who suffered	168.4373
more than you i do not think so yes those who have died of hunger danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed	64.3289
the drawingrooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture	314.8995
dartagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwells and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could	70.8520
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctors niece hold your tongue porthos said athos you are insupportable will you enter this carriage and that without offering the	122.5379
least resistance without making the least noise he took you for buckingham cried dartagnan	140.6356
he first kills m	1483.6929
shall we wait or shall we charge let us charge them answered the gascon	101.4454
ill manage it somehow you will see but said dartagnan now i think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight nothing at all said groslow	215.3499
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much you have rightly guessed madame replied	127.3352
the count	22.4887
on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation	140.0246
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting	159.2708
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step	788.3220
at last he sank	65.9773
what is this name of monte cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title i believe mother it is merely a title	73.0428
the countess de winter as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from dartagnan not all that had happened but what dartagnan himself knew	125.2165
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance	217.1563
shall i leave you	11.4324
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion	195.5527
this letter was in miladys handwriting only this time it was addressed to m	84.6081
raoul at the same time seized one of the young mans hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man	52.9034
and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight	139.6501
the burglary chapter	388.9221
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day	136.1848
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice	90.9115
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back	152.7326
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	50.4716
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos	70.9918
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	209.6481
then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all	244.6251
about seven oclock in the evening the boatman had taken over a young woman wrapped in a black mantle who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized but entirely on account of her precautions the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty	74.8999
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe i ought rather to say what i know what you know and even what i am sure of and of what are you so sure i would say	75.9701
that i know this great lady you yes i and how do you know her oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion speak by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things what have you done oh nothing which was	103.0637
not right in the character of a creditor well monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post	88.9164
then he began to search	24.7769
at the moment caderousse quitted his sentrylike watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday	151.9601
he is then the same englishman whom i metatahyes indeed	150.7196
however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian lifea life of politeness visiting and introductions monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty	289.6045
he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antechamber	189.1543
once upon a time well go on signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justicehe had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them	88.6405
anne of austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her	102.3409
all this must be prepared against	85.8670
as for me i hate the court and have but one desire at this momentvengeance	121.0043
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent	118.4276
some wine cried the stupefied host some wine	322.3556
yes and who is it said porthos	39.9403
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmonds last wishes the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow	169.5972
no louise no this evenings adventure will serve for my excuse	998.3068
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil	69.1824
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz	78.5013

she remained nearly always in her secondfloor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the doora duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out	214.3785
into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte	597.0468

as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	130.8469
during that time he had many moments of despair	42.5723

let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish but dont mistake said dartagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may thinkfor it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received	135.8060

grimaud had indeed during twentytwo years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athoss imminent death was likely to make him uneasy	243.7231
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty	209.1616
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	197.6661
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest	109.7944
bonacieux dead and to dartagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life	106.9613

only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for	195.0231
the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	57.5481
i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures the stone seems very brilliant answered the count	184.1317

they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room	76.8662
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than another	115.0326
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said dartagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him	71.4143
a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you dartagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis	197.0191
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès	98.4077
you say sir said the king	19.9606
dartagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he dartagnan and his friend had rendered to the queens party in the morning	93.9934
yes his mother but does he know this secret then i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope i pronounced no name for i knew none except	175.1828
his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges thus speaking he fell back exhausted	106.5793

will your excellency visit saint peters asked the _cicerone_	211.7450
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around	140.6995
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict	318.8674
think if i am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief true said dartagnan	59.3896
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated	97.0450
he was received by baptistin	139.4479
in one hour after the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with letters	338.5648
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents	46.2434
villequier said guitant	117.2240
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart	18.1405
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	71.7058
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme	90.3445
at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	28.0274

it is only shown to me to terrify me thats all you are mistaken	57.5199
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible	172.7788
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation	127.8810
hes a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hairgrease hed take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant	362.6541
with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too the frenchman knocked at the inner door and entered the first room his shadow did the same	96.8380
my dear fellow i invited them to a dinner the next day replied aramis	54.8036
i have come for nothing else but to tell you so but what is the meaning of this change i cannot tell you explain yourself i cannot explain myself come tell me what is the joke monsieur le vicomte knows that i never joke yes but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to remain with	55.9988
me and that olivain should return to paris	67.3910
dartagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into dartagnans breast crying one for you and one for methe best for last cried dartagnan furious nailing him	100.6705
to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body	136.8191
then the ironhearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept	72.7953
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	221.7963
meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician	282.8542
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands	79.7974
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate	147.4548
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason	415.7764
ah monsieur de comminges he said	16.6981
this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in	101.6286
nor was this all	286.6302
it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle that you knew it and i was not informed of it that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it that by an infamous treaty	109.5326
you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament	61.2432
with francs we can reach marseilles with francsare you sure albert oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made	238.0785
bazin my friend said aramis you dont seem to be aware that i can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all i have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation	78.8038
what is it said monte cristo	7.8595
the man somewhat crestfallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said	213.5809
it is important that he should receive it before eleven oclock	62.9836
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate	84.0612
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket	121.7908
cries of death death to the guards to the seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it was	96.0521
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning	267.5501
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you	141.0279
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king be easy said aramis i will take two poniards and give one to parry	124.1555
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely	373.9085
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think of whom pardieu of monsieur de bouillon my friend i think that he is much troubled with gout you noticed that i didnt breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit you did well you would have caused him an access of his disease	96.4571
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	62.1821
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his francs and the other livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the bankers servants so much did their	165.4740
gratitude need an object to expend itself upon	305.5457
albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs	118.6526
noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference is it a suitable match in every respect and the young man is regarded with universal esteem you approve of him he is one of the most wellbred young men i know during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent	128.6484
your eminence may be certain of that the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately	85.0882
but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass	47.8514
on seeing him the regiment of corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces put them into confusion and reentered charenton flying	93.0447
the sum was collected in a minute	245.0675
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves listen to monsieur de tréville said the king listen to him would not one say he was speaking of a religious community	85.9423
these poor creatures had no bad intentions	392.7971
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence my chaise broke down coming into lilliers capital what _capital_ yes i want your chaise and how shall i travel then on horseback you talk very comfortablya hundred and eighty leagues whats that one can do it afterward afterward	205.1514
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first timethis garden the actual scene of my crimemust have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know	150.0527
the cause	1285.2396
m	nan
well when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say hes a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master by jove i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living athos was for a few moments thoughtful	160.0380
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you	111.2342
formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable	189.9644
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candlespectres such as hoffmann strews over his punchdrenched pages like black fantastic dust	225.0677
these three windows were in madame de saintmérans room	37.3134
my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his willfor he was master	170.0070
we will do the same the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with dartagnan	72.1938
grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road	94.5137
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder	260.3058
dartagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not come	62.5006
well m	261.6523
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain at the moment when the hand of the massive timepiece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of	275.6223
the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door	44.2234
during the darkness as before my supper was brought	108.0780
i mean as i love	98.2405
at this moment comminges rushed into the room	20.5516

m it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a halfcircle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglarsit is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your	103.8827
first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly	157.0443
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place	46.8279
do you know what that warning was no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal yes thats it no doubt said milady returning the letter to mme	94.7379
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village	275.6768
de villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the lawmade man	79.5680
section	nan
it is i shouted a voice	152.7342
happy rogue said caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed yes said andrea	57.3839
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jews again what will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain	93.3279
what then how much do you require for my ransom merely the you have about you danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart	217.5638
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it now they begin to look concerned nonsense however raoul must be diverted from this fancy	387.0819
nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	43.2781
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is	143.7705
a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine	67.7305
what are you going to do cried mme	15.8936
uncle and nephew	219.9934
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos	138.6697
we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us youre right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate	73.9940
well madame unhesitatingly repeated debray	964.7040
how absurdas if one crown were not as good as another	394.7458
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water	379.7131
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won	221.7402
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable and do you not remember the frenchmans name said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator	81.0970
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert	132.6359
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	206.7964
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood	120.3995
the man in the red cloak chapter lxv	57.5222
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this since dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison	95.0673
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers	199.2970
with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls	282.7556
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	170.4161
m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken	161.5175
in that case i should beat a retreat	51.9799
have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdicta trial sir i ask only for a trial that surely cannot be denied to one who is accused we shall see said the inspector then turning to the governor on my word the poor devil touches me	152.8643
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent	80.1402
you were right he said my dear monsieur dartagnan and you cannot set out yet	47.6285
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in	91.3830
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder	120.0970
he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later louis xiv	61.9744
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	329.3090
at length franz arrived at the word myself	112.8351
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy	219.0331
mme	nan
fighting here are you	18.1129
athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful smile	178.2139
monte cristo drew out his watch	20.0693
vampa then rushed towards teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed	109.3250
order was reestablished in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another	213.4211
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind	150.3145
i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers they are coming full gallop the prince is with themah he is leaving them they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going on in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the	169.1377
drums beat the duc de beaufort drew his sword	58.2119
a man was hidden in lafittes bankinghouse behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk he saw mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw albert withdraw	208.1405
happen what will the devil take them they cant eat us and he mounted his horse	85.0298
be philosophers as i am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us drink	65.2304
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat	106.2081
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie	87.4104
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face	55.5070
what are you about said dartagnan	22.5814
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to	89.9198

this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away who told you that my dear asked milady	83.2057
in the year i was transferred to piedmont in france	78.4701
but what has happened then since last evening count the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi i have seen a ghost and that ghost told me morrel that i had lived long enough maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other	107.1882
leave me i command you carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest	129.7648
on the evening of the th of september m	16.5344
my life belongs to my cash	165.0745
have you traded it for your diamond no it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather frenchwomanfor i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned her that ring comes from milady cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion	113.8355
noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron dépinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which	97.8043
had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	176.8447
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor	431.2143
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	320.0195
you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you	22.1833
nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows everything in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife perhaps he may but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wifes relations with madame de chevreuse but monseigneur i know nothing	62.7785
about them i have never seen her when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her and how many were there of these linen drapers two monseigneur and where did they live one in rue de vaugirard the other rue	170.2762
de la harpe did you go into these houses with her never monseigneur i waited at the door and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone she gave me none she told me to wait and i waited you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal	106.5221
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death put him to death franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	164.7874
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung true replied grimaud	420.7043
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart	86.4937
why said aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were shot well i said dartagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot	239.1029
some traveller seems impatient said the host	338.4084
you particularly wish it asked he	901.6461
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	317.5440
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak	217.3586
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight	207.5455
the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue	47.4132
the young man burst into a laugh	28.3058
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert	84.8685
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand	18.1516
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	103.6600
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times i shall do so if only in gratitude eh cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder	452.8762
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m	104.4475
it is a false diamond said caderousse	41.8105
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock	53.0651
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle	168.8273
i thought i had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	124.2273

i detest him an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income thats true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune dartagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing	100.1669
this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses	210.3097
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother	127.4289
haydée said he you well know why do you address me so coldlyso distantly asked the young greek	86.4785
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard	99.7289
it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest	81.0325
is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	163.4236
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise	61.2572
why do you stop here asked dépinay	100.1360
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind	193.4940
then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your heart	79.8367
you will excuse me will you not	56.6491
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl	194.3946
at five oclock albert returned delighted with his days work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome	115.9481
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	152.1469

grimauds first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hours riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse	171.5705
and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe	104.9951
another queen in want of help	264.5467
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us what aramis you think that dartagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy among friends my dear athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head	132.6683

at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself	65.7079
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocketmoney he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his	262.6197
vases and his jewelboxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there	96.3719

the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply	36.1809
from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of teresa and had sworn she should be his	74.4090
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	123.9474
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved dartagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man	149.9938
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was empty	140.0971
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance	279.0822
de salvieux to do so	56.9858

well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon	103.0308
the great are often ungrateful very true said dartagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queens diamond which mazarin wore on his finger	91.2172
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache	76.2433

yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife	108.3286
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned	122.3522
de villeforts garden from what you relate i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saintmérans death	103.8848
i told her my orders from m	130.3230

the abbés chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbés cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees	209.6855

de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet	487.4355
danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow	115.8097
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in	256.0248

his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	405.3727
dartagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword	61.5498
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos	205.9870

dartagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servants offices	197.2290
do you take me for half a woman	52.9672
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model	376.7966
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct	162.1670
athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	252.4303
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchengarden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and dartagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went	124.3664
beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia	246.2954
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch	154.0937
we cannot fight with such names they are names of shepherds therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said athos	152.0270
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre	125.0098
then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables	577.5939

you are right duchess	121.4468
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and dartagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche	76.4602
my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you	86.9720
rendered me and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions	98.2517
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed dartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger i am told that there is a general insurrection the uniform of the kings musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not	94.3678
the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns did you witness the injury sustained by comminges monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards the cardinal smiled as he spoke	147.1496
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice	145.5069
listen replied felton in a low voice	18.6042
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear	103.0837
milady sprang toward him	79.6429
the abbé dherblay	192.5234
come come dearest valentine confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust m it is true said valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend but still you acted from	125.5117
motives of selfinterest my dear maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us	119.2840
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos dartagnan and he stopped short	173.3227
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers door	46.9775
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	301.0356
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room	104.2383
their connection could not last long without ruining both	695.4224
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti	62.2700

well i must mortify myself	95.0967
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done mordaunt bowed humbly	104.4436
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression	168.5104
he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthosthat is to say exactly upon the baldric	134.4686
adieu adieu dearest edmond cried mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the balcony	99.0803
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again	206.2077

under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	453.7319
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years then no misfortune has happened to you and what misfortune could happen to me	57.2557
ah diavolo he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that fourheaded combination of devils and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps	104.4304
villeforts dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of m	455.1183
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him	147.0823
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself demolished	240.3964
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door	79.3927
she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham	56.7841
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his illhumor	205.4203
ah my lord said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time	26.7767
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still	51.1370
if you do not come across one return for me the patron shook his head	64.0735
you will charge broussel to report it	232.7694
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms	87.0565
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	181.7618

yes ruined now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says	292.4245

as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty	94.0910

de villefort saw it open before him	65.8740
he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry	188.5825

parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony	161.9789
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress	37.3051
and besides he said going out of this chamber isnt all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were yesterday	85.7069
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected	186.8061
well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several illlooking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces a quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know i dont like quarrelers and that is the reason why i have	82.5577
the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault what have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow	102.1924

dartagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the rue cherishmidi or chasemidi as it was then called	171.3283
at halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert	151.9903
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the thirdrate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone	207.6253
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive	127.8038
i assure you franz and i were lost in admiration nothing more simple returned the count	98.1737

still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself	113.8071
at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectatorsromans italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius	213.2737

sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer	141.6694
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by dartagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them	86.2867
did you send this wine aramis said athos	85.9224
ah ah but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos	454.4664
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism	165.8363
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance	306.2752
you are only responsible for my body is it not so	67.4190
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous no i am pleasedso pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed andrea you speak to me before	105.3776

the worthy shipowner knew from penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him	231.1304
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into mme	133.1004
my own service said dartagnan	66.0502
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform	69.9652
porthos could hardly keep his countenance	166.2034
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain	52.7494
all now replied la ramee	75.7192
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change ones prison say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin	73.4430
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life	57.5573
fortunately i dont know where he is how cried dartagnan you dont know where aramis is formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition	124.6481
hasty actions are generally bad ones	675.2174

chapter	nan
as soon as his engagement with the patron of _la jeune amélie_ ended he would hire a small vessel on his own accountfor in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastresand under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo	107.0899
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder	113.6839
he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwells letter	102.1273
pray try and obtain a small government pension for her every revolution has its catastrophes returned m	604.9955
speak you kill me be satisfied you are not guilty toward me and i have already pardoned you what next	73.5357
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenants visit	85.1056
he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought	86.3622
bonacieux having left his house at seven oclock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence	65.7067
the latter continued in thought	260.0410
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet	177.1722
you morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs	251.4898
what you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead	95.5061
ah pardon i thought so but we will return to my lord duke presently	140.3484
vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by teresa	127.3442
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre at one oclock this morning she had not returned my god what can have become of her then we shall know be assured	78.7201
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself	23.5257
then he went out	10.2732
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant what mousqueton is here then oh yes monsieur	170.0894
lucien had found time preparatory to the counts arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars	157.8625
porthos said dartagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me oh good heaven said planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen i will tell	82.3462
you all about it replied mousqueton	230.8339
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths	171.8588
i have already told youavenge him on whom on his murderers how should i know who they are order them to be sought for why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel	154.7214
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you cannot grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in _athalie_	141.4613
this was the abbé scarron always laughing joking complimentingyet sufferingand toying nervously with a small switch	910.4540
dartagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more selfcontrol had banished from his own	110.3996
la chesnaye louis xiiis confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call	227.5705
on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said porthos	91.8216
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur	35.9759
is it my fortune which you find insufficient	154.4425
indeed when placed beside m	3740.8103
i have replied dartagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table	38.6352
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	80.4753
but what changes occur it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever	195.9413
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me	176.6209
planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of dartagnan and which dartagnan from that time made shift to do without	159.5927
bonacieux	nan
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grownup daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise ones pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m	164.6545
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater terror	138.6093
at the sight of the little letter the heart of dartagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	60.8334
no still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man	55.2477
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	54.3622
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of youof our friends and on my part said dartagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything to love you cry fie friends are shadows the world is a sepulcher alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with	103.3434
a sigh	339.9596
at other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb him	121.1828
the pope and cæsar borgia first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and cæsar spada one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope	220.6057
chapter xii	113.7675
hasten to monte cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man	280.1378
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i dont stand upon ceremony said dartagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep	170.4822
do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house	56.1946
let them try to pursue him why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franzs host had the honor	159.8730
of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges	179.3626
at the same hour as on the preceding evening dartagnan retired	56.9114
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune	38.3789
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow	93.6604
i say that he doesnt suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramiss advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said	135.5595
porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned dartagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port	125.9733
it is magnificent said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words	140.3649
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said dartagnan	213.4235
he probably had succumbed	2238.7034
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part certainly i see you are a model mentor said albert goodbye we shall return on sunday	99.5575
that was your fault all my oil is lost oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him all my sausages are gnawed there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host	201.7694
i am a man of order sir let us do things in order nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you i command here ah sir said dartagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us	72.7815
it was mousqueton	139.1065
dartagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything i will answer for nothing	89.0815
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	353.5100
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m	38.4035
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment	151.9622
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything	45.9705
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused	79.3178
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean	87.3003
at these words he gave me a ring	34.8032
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twentyfive steps	61.8664
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic	171.0818
besides here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of beef i am recruiting myself said porthos i am recruiting myself	93.8985
good dartagnan is for mazarin he said to himself	48.2374
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer	131.5385
yes madame replied the officer	18.2367
but i say no more madame it is really as if i were prescribing for you the clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her	71.2427
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection that is possible said the countess reflecting	254.0680

her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband	113.8575

the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti not so mademoiselle eugénie danglars	419.2186
did he send you yes sir he sent for me to his house gave me money for my journey procured a horse and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you i have come in fifteen hours albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper	95.6552
take him out and shoot him the prisoner turned pale	71.4910
no you are at your journeys end how monsieur and you i am going a few steps farther and monsieur leaves me here alone you are afraid planchet no i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that a lackey who has the rheumatism makes but a poor servant particularly	195.7522
to a master as active as monsieur well if you are cold planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six oclock in the morning monsieur i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that i have not a sou left in	94.5415
case i should be cold heres half a pistole	238.2791
from their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders	152.6297
on the twentyeighth of october the capitulation was signed	124.4496
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget	100.2926
danglars then opened the window	30.4368
athos and aramis left paris after this coupdetat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton	57.5439
the devil thought porthos this is poor work	688.9152
yes the enemy	352.0136
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich rich said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect	138.5607
de tréville nor the musketeers to complain but on the contrary for him whose people the musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had endeavored to burn	134.7471
six days why thats as long as the almighty took to make the world too long a waittoo long but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo oh i shall not cried franz	133.7906
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé	94.3713
in that case i can give you proofs no sir said dartagnan and we place ourselves at your orders well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay today is the last day granted me by the cardinal	65.3951
my political opinions replied dantès	383.7986
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers	253.9563
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france	70.2768
i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen	123.3825
de tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist though	1386.3959
would to heaven of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton	118.2698
madame danglars had started when villefort on the counts invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own	102.9033
yes	nan
yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love a plague ont i shall not do so	40.0785
what the devil dartagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger chapter xxix	152.0594
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone not even before you philip	127.1487
i will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons	118.0803
i am temporarily commander of the _pharaon_ with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue	195.1118
two minutes later the thunder of a horses hoofs was heard upon the road it was grimaud on his way to paris	72.1092
bertuccio remained standing before him	33.2818
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	107.8286
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin	124.9053
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle	42.8847
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden morrel looked at her with astonishment	74.8935
it was an imposing sight to witness this old man apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong	275.8970
athos as a diplomatist	201.7523
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine with a heavy heart dartagnan again bent his way toward the ferry	117.0268
no misfortune has happened to the queen cried buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the question	138.0159
de tréville alone remaining with the wounded	177.3791
now let us return to your particular world	32.3149
of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccios story	92.3897
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement	158.3916
and his name said he	30.8311
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her off	122.1456
it is well said the abbé we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter past twelve oclock instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour	163.6547
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory	62.8028
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men	146.2689
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ships lantern was hung up at the masthead instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore	191.6767
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village _armentières_ read porthos armentières	209.7699
sdeath i would die willingly for the king but supposing i happened to be killed on account of mazarin as your nephew came near being today there could be nothing in paradise however well placed i might be there that could console me for it well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the king hears of your	154.3749
loyalty	nan
i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless i give it to you with great pleasure and i my lord said dartagnan accept it as it is given	69.6141
that i believe answered m	217.4222
mme	nan
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek one is i believe from phædrus and the other from bias	229.7249
but fortunately the world is a sepulcher the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie fie dartagnan dartagnan cried aramis you are killing me well here it is at last said dartagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket	109.7627
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me	113.3017
it was now athoss turn to take a sly look	119.7532
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more	53.3216
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey	128.9379
come said dartagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where athos is no sir replied planchet	80.6050
heres the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea and what on earth are you going to do with it asked athos	55.3605
dartagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others	91.4466
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad come come calm yourself madame puritan or ill remove you to a dungeon	288.0422
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness yes said the old man	142.3433
hey friend cried the duke	23.1472

de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders	73.9009
de villeforts house	56.1152
take it then and pray disturb us no longer said madame de villefort giving the album to edward who then went towards the door led by his mother	61.9309
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him	71.5795
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the contraryand it is i who say itsee enemies in all directions	138.8779
the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson french at the moment when morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him	178.3720
brucea ferruginea	2069.9866
he looked at alberthe was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it	168.7841
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truthhe cared little for that _mene mene tekel upharsin_ which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wallbut what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them	283.9168
look well at me said monte cristo putting the light near his face	54.2473
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man	25.2692
what was the matter with you baron dartagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal	37.8386
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the _pharaon_	72.4082
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a womans happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings	231.2806
mazarin is better lodged said aramis	207.8645
i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery	96.1869
i am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart	271.5858
my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your eminence orders an escalade but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal	159.7795
well one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant art thou sure said the man in the cloak	95.0042
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou accepted	108.2741
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports	133.9081
as for you you have acted like a barmaid	83.7990
have you not yet divined who he is what cried felton heagain healways he	236.6444
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on	31.0033
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner	32.4294
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	383.7207
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heartthree of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the	120.6702
same morning	46.2948
i am quite ready said dartagnan but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing and what is that asked milady	35.8249
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter dartagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes	70.2842
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an _auberge_ recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man	161.3590
there were two doors he bolted them both	424.1064
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	216.3705
de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans	605.3931
i have engaged the three lower windows at the café rospoli should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution send one of your	199.3021
men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him	89.1177
you will go to london continued the cardinal	24.1421
we hear from yanina chapter	492.7614
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground	50.9349
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here madame those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been for they are the agents of the cardinal and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille my	108.9346
husband in the bastille cried mme	99.2984
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar	172.6113

possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to dartagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn	100.1725
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that	116.7960

has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself	444.5564

but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messengers departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	159.2424
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal _proprio motu_	180.5721
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst dartagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left	27.9223
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box	45.0799
de tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions	118.0210
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women	1088.1178
but where you go i go they then set off for rueil	185.7243
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	73.0689
the life of the four young men had become fraternal	73.4131

bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else	100.5299
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands	21.3887
but it has none in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank	116.9672
you do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again ah you virtuous men said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping	170.9822
upon his immense sword	420.8931
really captain groslow you are too much in fortunes way	329.5121
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne	67.6752
butformerlyit appears began mousqueton timidly	2480.0791
he followed him	28.0515
so i think and therefore i said were our object money only but we want something else replied the gascon	183.9831
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh	149.4133
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power one thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athosthe best friend of dartagnan	84.0233
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing	185.5899
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her	16.5709
my uncle answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my family cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed	191.8278
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against six	177.4433
is that all yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity	352.7514
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur dherblay entirely as to the last point though i agree with him on the first	105.6053
is there anything new in the wind nothing i thought perhaps that the kings death has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here what have you come for then to embark with you ah ah the general doubted my fidelity no but i wish to have a share in my revenge	143.5135
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwells tent dartagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle	97.5394
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers	222.2419
he began as you begin	348.0260
i will tell you mr president	150.4866
if on the contrary i die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man	152.4383
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	80.0461
i am myself a frenchman	85.8284
you are joking holloa patrick sign my lord never never help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	134.6512
but although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	344.7976
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressinggown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar	172.5599
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiositythat is a terrible word why so	483.8432
dartagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying no sir i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied dartagnan	96.6230
do they know him asked châteaurenaud	101.6048
oh is it you dear friends	139.0840
your treasure stammered dantès	649.4821
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants	84.2200
on perceiving the count he rose quickly	83.6421
then he has not returned said the duke	47.0600
bertuccio the steward appeared at the door	36.7353
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms	79.7143
he arose and stood near mousqueton	223.1753
but fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes	199.7397
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporteah is that you de winter	104.7323
the man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey	111.6701
look at monsieur du vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage	170.9237
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	63.7120
athos made him a sign to come with them	15.9274
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba	34.8132
marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to vendin leaving the duc de chatillon to await and bring on the rest	71.5963
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos	52.5680
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young mans head fell on his breast	111.3522
that same night the general was to go over to the english	96.2364
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty	43.7704
de villefort even would not have alarmed him	64.3303
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else	166.5899
this time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined mordaunt	188.8634
dartagnan i am ready to follow you and i also said porthos	27.9917
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her	37.0844
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits there are no bandits cried debray	68.0846
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely	28.2921

he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook	96.2855
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their	289.9259
lackeys lackeys grumbled the cardinal	216.4190
if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur yes seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tréville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would	147.0345
be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn without doubt and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes you have already given me that reason and i find it excellent reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to	94.7961
you about rent very kind and adding to this if there be need of it meaning to offer you fifty pistoles if against all probability you should be short at the present moment admirable you are rich then my dear monsieur bonacieux i am comfortably off monsieur thats all i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three	150.0582

the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected	187.3929
only dartagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that mans hat upon which is written the name of the village of ah said dartagnan i comprehend that name written in her hand you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still chapter lxiv	87.5752

young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe upon my honor said the prince	70.9767
i hate him i confess it openly	175.3229
behind the doorkeeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her	93.2027
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queens apartments	113.8714
the groom cried aloud for help	334.1055
richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money	83.6680
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter	51.5072
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman	142.4308
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare	143.5987
the diningroom was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique basreliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands	149.6173
it would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos	118.2700
no dartagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time	162.7934
see look at fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked	193.1349
at them with her clear and bright eyes	199.4034
no violence violence is the proof of weakness	349.8003
are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd	243.2420
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	254.8933
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme	500.8956

the king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter take him alive no it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier	169.6706
in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation	249.9137
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much and i hate her said châteaurenaud	50.1929
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus	80.7346
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion	98.9426
yes returned dartagnan who had overheard him tonight gentlemen we rescue the king dartagnan said athos this is no joke i trust	123.1288
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate	64.0375
ah she cried what a frightful dream villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream	76.7952
let us get ready gentlemen but this second letter said athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened	80.0424
the matter was no longer doubtful	81.8315
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged	140.2430
we must go replied villefort offering his arm	86.2582
the felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves	292.8618
i say that valentine is dead replied davrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness	136.5916
however she offered the cardinal laportes place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other	101.1830
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule	255.6892
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying	246.0021
but doctor you see me already so grievedhow can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow	234.7240
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural _ma foi_ said châteaurenaud i would rather end my career like m	192.6060
oh whatever may be m	262.1391
capital answered the mendicant	160.4863
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winters inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word	169.8918
then you know what i have suffered said mme	35.9725
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance	87.8374
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris	114.5623
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds	53.1426
besides by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux interrupted dartagnan	214.4438

dartagnan when he gave way to his own feelingswhich were in accordance with those of the queenhad accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted	127.1775
behold nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant	147.3193
i have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the french	84.4906
he was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises	215.8907
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter	56.1532
dartagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened	82.9241
instead of going direct to his study m	173.7798
but what is the matter with my hands asked milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice milady held out her arms her wrists were bruised	101.0861
the people who wrote are anglogermans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	164.4547
it seems to me said dartagnan with a thousand livres eachi do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word _procurator_ roused porthos	122.2030
stay said monte cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees well my man digging found a box or rather the ironwork of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant m monte cristo felt the	142.1312
arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled	288.1113
chapter	nan
davrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m	145.8918
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what	84.2132
beauty has always been and always will be allpowerful	293.9785
well then porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns	190.8056
dartagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground	40.7121
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of	183.2337
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone	193.0166
it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander he dismounted and entered	96.6781
it matters little	12680.9834
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart	108.6124
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie	108.6236
dream of vengeance chapter xxxvii	84.0171
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière denfer taking the road to orléans	76.3620
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold	11.5480
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers	225.7200
are you coming morrel directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing	69.4223
what are you thinking of dartagnan he began	55.6650
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me	67.0255
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m	70.1665
save your skin begone quickly dartagnan did not budge	401.6429
m he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocketbook and both began for the third time to count their gold and banknotes	105.5484
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his purse	157.3608
patience said athos i had a plan	39.8371
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding	88.4953
i have not said goodmorning to you monsieur dartagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you	88.0715
de villeforti intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house	286.8662
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes she then bowed to m	96.9191
at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only threequarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavernkeeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace	122.1813
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear dartagnan what a fearful day when today we find our friends yes but under what circumstances tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done things look black enough replied porthos i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle	123.8102
that horrible mordaunt silence cried the gascon do not utter that name but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english dartagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity	246.7400
yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are wretch cried dartagnan speak quickly who employed you to assassinate me a woman whom i dont know but who is called milady but if you dont know this woman how do you know her name	93.4915
my comrade knows her and called her so	286.9850
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	76.1105
he rose to return the salutation	178.5124
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battlefield the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself	98.1590
de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself	59.9339
first and tréville nextor even perhaps before himself	964.6673
dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities	180.3342
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos	113.1146

thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want now it is for me to perform my promise	81.4653
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased	76.9973
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	791.3100
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and châteaurenaud	79.1095
i wish after such a scene to be alone mazarin bent low before her	274.1648
steel is for gentlemen and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulters skull and crushed it	230.1569
morrel unhappy exclaimed the abbé	539.8705
speak then i beg of you i wait and listen since there is no harm said athos in my knowing that dartagnan is here i presume there will be none in his knowing that i am here i have received no orders on that point well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his	69.2445
neighbor	nan

i go out he said	54.7188
but let us be quickthe king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort levêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in m	71.6257
it was from mme	128.5716
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it	60.4389
yes the gascon answered athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body	478.8570
is it about sending me to the bastile	80.9864
during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators	258.8398
good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name	111.2303
already up raoul exclaimed the count	143.3950
and what brought you here i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort	166.2615
why dont we go in with them asked porthos	95.0087
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest	170.2421

and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed	67.8761
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture	50.4465
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_ who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no	228.3889
restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	255.2942
we set forth on our journey and have you never revisited that village eagerly asked madame de chevreuse	131.0291
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families	432.3992

i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also	55.6070
bonacieux to the chamber of examination	198.6121
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it fernand became deadly pale	160.8258
could the prisoners see each other he asked	69.3959
then you must not pay us we can scud like the _pharaon_ under bare poles enough enough cried morrel almost overpowered leave me i pray you we shall meet again in a happier time	228.3339
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied	89.6282
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sireno grace for the guilty happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right	56.6468
as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my anger it is you sire who have now incurred hers	230.4690
if you drag us both before a tribunal i will still say no my daughter is not guiltythere is no crime in my house	100.7036
constance constance cried dartagnan	207.0258
this space passed mme	1670.3577
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold	56.4572
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise oh my god listen	80.3327
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit	89.0916
everything goes as if in flowery paths everything goes too well porthos	517.7592
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned never mind ill fix that all right	221.3246
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his fortune was based	311.1171
what next de wardes cannot boast of anything how is that	243.1194
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme	68.2957
oh do not say so it will break my resolutions but not mine mother replied albert	167.1703
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	252.8990
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	98.0693
then said dartagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do yes said athos let us give the money to the lackeysnot to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman	42.8256
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream	318.4016
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause	473.8465
expenses on the road about fifty francs	35.7660
morbleu cried the latter i should say that i do pledge myself to it i had no hope of getting off so easily he gives you his word of honor said gondy	66.1567
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end	76.6256
mr spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him	88.3210
her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his firstrate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife	207.2736
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal	141.4631
however i scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe me	135.0165
then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused	173.6360
i do not hem said dartagnan there is some truth in what you say ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court but you speak of him not of his party his resources it is truethe queen is	117.6471
for him something in his favor but he will never have the king a mere child a child who will be of age in four years	66.4501
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk besides should any illluck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended	177.8889
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long	246.8693
rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed	31.4710
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	137.5836
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart oh i feel easy replied porthos	120.6347
speak said athos we cannot see your signs	73.5684
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death	73.4713
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m	84.1416
and now once more adieu said morrel	167.8440
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time	68.3488
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the _pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended	162.0037
in this case replied caderousse lets have some more wine	283.2863
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight oclock had been watching his door	38.2973
dartagnan himself was moved by them	204.9380
m when monte cristo entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the baroness was examining some drawings which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m	77.7417
ah its all one said the host i have lost two customers but this one remains of whom i am pretty certain for some days to come	103.0329
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaunt yes they would have all been blown up just so	158.7314
we are going according to all probability to la rochelle and once gone she will follow you to the end of the world athos if she recognizes you	58.0104
ah ah said the listener not through doors but through windows ah this visit was expected	487.8638
ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have it good god cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear dartagnan i think yes cried dartagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my friend ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires	124.2961
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers	94.6284
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment	95.0548
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses	152.9023
but here is m	70.3097
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on	108.9151
why should you expose your game to your adversary	102.0958
meantime he was going to try to find out milady	33.1950
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possiblethat the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as	133.3270
he prayed he wept	563.3703
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	64.1064
when they entered the port it was already night	77.8715
come dartagnan dont let us play a sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice ah my dear athos you know that i am not alluding to you you are the pearl of	163.7779
brave bold men	711.8887
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the	264.7625
mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of men i admire greatly still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person	210.2847
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness	75.9893
yes you i know you now	54.3033
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad but if he does not come said dartagnan	42.2547
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetitegriefand as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatand love	82.6666
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager	127.3448
yes and i take your brother with me oh count said julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance	118.0674
then the landing began	132.3922
in france he cried the usurper in france then they did not watch over this man	84.1398
the article was not inserted by mei was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending	114.9981
my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons certainly my dear sir and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet no no i will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the	70.4818
preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocationin my opinion the time ought not to be yet	95.9004
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope	338.2926
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	103.6513
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed	127.9863
the woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered handkerchief who told you there was a woman here replied aramis becoming as pale as death	113.1346
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance	66.0307
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man	25.1673
well at twentynine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife	84.7386
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses	62.2374
tis well and may this money profit you adieu i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other the abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled	242.4135
in coming	941.9056
morrel	nan
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues	124.5914
mazarin bowed	169.6705
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor	184.0560
the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention	155.1303
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pityedmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold	130.0181
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy	190.8300
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	392.9720
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day	167.0743
the king advanced toward madame the president with whom he was to dance and his highness monsieur with the queen	77.2784
i come from the cardinal said the officer	42.5740
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know i fight in the cause of honor ah that is something serious so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service what is it to be my second that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home	86.6543
remember it is you who have ruined me yes yes to be sure kitty said dartagnan be at ease my girl	82.1777
do but make no treatyyou understand me you need not fear morrel advanced towards beauchamp and châteaurenaud who seeing his intention came to meet him	141.1041
threequarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him	49.1133
dartagnan thought of all these matters	68.6056
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those	141.3318
propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them	27.1741
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching	154.0237
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier	242.3401
chapter lxx	568.1539
dépinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family	493.0303
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life	419.3318
of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are shed you who weep dartagnan and the curate appeared pleased	488.1654
danglars in the commissariat department	355.6809
de tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nightsfor they set out on the twentyfourth at five oclock in the evening and as a further kindness m	116.5622
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you sir said the young man will you be so good as	63.2555
to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister that is a strange question said aramis	57.6118
well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed	85.3191
light me m	2342.8242
au revoir not farewell	1023.5524
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states	43.1862
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic why so said danglars why dramatic can we account for instinct said monte cristo	179.9259
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian	215.7094
we are carrying too much canvas	236.9793
i swear to you i protest oh but god is above god will punish you my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer upon the gospel said dartagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did i do not	69.9957
believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures	345.8983
this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself said milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith we do what we can and she rushed out of the room	60.8909
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion	124.5899
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year and related to the true cardinal	52.8041
thanks for those sweet words oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks oh my lord you have ill understood wrongly interpreted i did not mean to say silence silence cried the duke	159.2441
now promise me to remember this and expect me the st of may at the same hour in the forenoon capital exclaimed albert your breakfast shall be waiting where do you live no rue du helder have you bachelors apartments there	236.5223
the interview	3045.3755
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper	250.0533
dartagnan hits on a plan	257.9409
apropos said dartagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent	135.3698
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more	151.8526
was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs	227.2668
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	58.4509
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	88.2462
aramis related what had been agreed upon	149.7991
how do i know	14.9628
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majestys wishes charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	305.4066
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child	82.7396
they had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village the redtiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk whose large hat and gray worsted dress made them take him for an augustine brother	148.2478
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar	77.1070
m	nan
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person and who is this third person monsieur le prince he has come then as they told me last evening and you have seen him he has just left	104.5698
me and will he aid this project the plan is his own and paris he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion the plan is not wanting in grandeur i see but one impediment what is it impossibility a senseless word	264.8646
at eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that dartagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow	84.7637
then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel to travel she murmured	46.3877
when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost	217.8374
in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family	185.5347
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbé smiled	78.2550
i do not understand you so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze	78.8384
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was	33.8601
he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in miladys apartment which was to be seen through the blinds	104.9373
de morcerf fernand do you mean replied monte cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them all monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein	93.7446
does he often go to auteuil added he	135.2069
but what do you expect	13.7988
the movement was executed in silence and with precision	173.2484
dépinay	nan
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared	106.4005
if we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse and you say this treasure amounts to two millions of roman crowns nearly thirteen millions of our money impossible said dantès staggered at the enormous amount	166.4261
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	137.9111
but wait a minute anne of austria ran to her jewel case	157.4555
nevertheless you come as one in authority because i happened to be in the antechamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance	135.8929
the three presents of dartagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april the market town of meung in which the author of _romance of the rose_ was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it	83.5267
athos said the musketeer	38.8471
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiffnecked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir	93.5163
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come	89.5230
it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that only be back again in three months for the _pharaon_ added the owner patting the young sailor on the back cannot sail without her captain without her captain cried dantès his eyes sparkling with animation pray mind what you say	207.8150
for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart	153.7876
nobody knew	92.9595
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom dartagnan had given to comminges appeared	68.3451
at least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six months before us no madame said villefort instructions have been given	139.9577
upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was porthos and not dartagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and disappeared so it was with monsieur dartagnan this stranger meant to quarrel it appears so and do you know what has become of him no i never saw him until that moment	87.2605
and have not seen him since very well i know all that i wish to know	32.0590
who has told me this fine story monsieur	68.9874
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more	125.6769
charles was impatiently awaiting his return	139.1828
everything was as athos had foreseen	61.9683
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation yes	50.2688
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal	135.2013
if an individual project gutenberg electronic work is derived from texts not protected by copyright law does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges	39.4447
gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	173.9106
dartagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool	168.7435
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck	143.8973
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me	244.3960
i love most fondlyi love madlyi love as a man who would give his lifeblood to spare her a teari love valentine de villefort who is being murdered at this moment do you understand me	105.1200
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech	101.5988
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill	151.6037
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage	245.2699
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles	152.7567
you here said châteaurenaud passing his arms through the young captains are you a friend of villeforts	136.3555
first here is the letter	64.0602
ah yes happily i have replied valentine	117.4488
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis	90.4693
athos is near you said dartagnan warn him as i have warned you aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution	311.9203
help to put me on the bed i think i shall feel better there have you any one to depend on for assistance my wife is at durham and may return at any moment	105.1395
the sight is hideous fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves	378.3269
you are then in possession of francs asked the notary	52.9288
make haste dear lodger said he there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs and you know women dont like to be kept waiting thats kitty said dartagnan to himself and darted into the passage	140.0667
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility	298.1630
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone no my lord replied the impassive young man your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me in that case my brave lieutenant let us	157.3203
leave milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing	121.7879
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said athos	74.8426
each word that fell from his companions lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth	239.4431
has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep	136.3466
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw _la gironde_ we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board	159.2516
the lion was daunted the avenger was conquered	447.3653
without doubt the chancellor séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell but not finding it he summoned his resolution and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found	81.9182
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly	406.5726
without that what would become of me it was one oclock in the morning	41.2611
nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks	288.4871
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination	137.5320
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance	55.7118
i will not make a confidant of him alas said valentine i see that i have given you pain	42.4784
i merely ask you did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels	70.3610
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you save my husband save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself	91.5335
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice	88.3367
i am very anxious to see this man	16.7865
deuce take it cried dartagnan more moved than he had been for a long time dont despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one oh really cried raoul	76.2422
but as this dream cannot be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me	253.6615
there is none said athos	44.3772
and madame danglars and m	60.8521
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn	155.4388
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugénie hold your tongue the men are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest themi despise them what shall we do asked louise	212.8131
what hatred she distills motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and	257.7355
lofty castle how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme	237.3838
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates	373.1299
m it so happened that night that cucumetto had sent carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting	76.4844
porthos and aramis did the same	25.9907
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur dartagnan	20.2964
you know the proverb unlucky at play lucky in love you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge	237.2226
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends	385.7769
will that do capitally replied m	532.5793
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider	81.9910
perceiving her brotherinlaw she uttered a terrible cry	23.5034
i want to go into master broussels house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary	305.6015
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir	57.4826
i became very pale i felt my legs fail me i sought for a reply but could find nonei was silent	218.9013
permit me then my dear athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to m	151.0856
there is no god there is no providenceall comes by chance there is a providence there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe	116.5144
in him but who are you then asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count	75.2032
shall i see you again soon next week i hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and i will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much deranged very well i shall expect you	81.3154
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps	101.4464
dartagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it	47.5227
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved mea heart like yours felton a man like you	171.0592
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the	284.6660
holy see or a sultan of the _thousand and one nights_	198.4666
the marriage feast chapter	899.0406
milady had guessed aright	236.2909
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence	130.1521
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said dartagnan that matters little	81.9558
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m	64.0884
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived	41.5967
wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here diamond exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about why did you not hear all we said inquired caderousse	111.7456
i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make	86.2715
said franz	108.8400
still more he has lifted the corner of her maskthat shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong	110.4667
he had but one thoughtto go forward and he went	140.5948
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	53.1680
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	75.4825
well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in gods sight	326.3643
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	112.2028
beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there and m	159.5154
were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the bastion saint gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army such feats sir are done onceand never repeated however nowadays theres no need of so much heroism	306.0492
now said the baron look at this woman	50.6612
grimaud smiled	78.5611
can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville faith exclaimed planchet heres land in good condition if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy zounds cried dartagnan dont call him porthos nor even vallon call him de bracieux or de pierrefonds thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise as he approached the castle which had first	272.3078
attracted his eye dartagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken	184.6959
has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	81.6994
yes go go said she to her brother the effects _are_ drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them silence was reestablished	167.3823
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second	101.5529
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	202.4849
bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an instant	34.7432
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean dartagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	109.8177
well said renée i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your owna physician for instance	292.9362
two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you yes it is i and you come asked milady	104.0325
monsieur dartagnan said the _valetdechambre_	50.2108
meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her intended	126.7390
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter	101.5747
judge if i should not put myself under its protection flattery was at that period very current and m	286.0052
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy	207.9806
i have never seen her from that day	61.4489
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done	73.0922
me no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england then you dont know me sir it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you and on your honor you have no cause of hatred	56.5788
against me none i swear to you there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured	98.5826
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him	117.6512
that comforts me a little has he wit or notthis demon dartagnan said porthos astonished at his friends deception	315.0514
by degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course	223.1308
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master	167.7664
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valetdechambre called out make ready at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out la bruyere and du barthois march it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked dartagnan	122.5051
we started a stag of ten branches	1992.1012
no hermine replied debray you cannot make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the counts	59.9791
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends	109.4828
this instant sirthis instant i beseech you said the old lady	98.4130
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son may i ask how much he allows the young man five thousand francs per month sixty thousand francs per year	107.1510
de trévilles	58.1006
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian it was precisely similar to his sisters apartments except that for the breakfastparlor he had a billiardroom where he received his friends	148.9507
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not	38.7030
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder	99.5965
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such	98.2998
a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied	286.1053
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	34.5485
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed	147.7562
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which	161.3392
his host related the brief narrative	682.6950
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself	258.0684
he may desire to become my heir and re	290.7769
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening	32.4048
we have before stated that all the servants had fled	96.8093
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain	657.1528
you have read the letter yes you know how imperfectly the women of the _mezzo cito_ are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class yes well read the letter again	113.9485
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows	90.8506
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m	33.8635
decidedly monsieur dartagnan you are the man i have been seeking	29.4639
the window yielded	821.8904
if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it this postscript decreased greatly the young girls happiness	144.9469
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized	351.5775
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door well dont be inactive inactive my dear fellow ask porthos	248.9996
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father	124.9941
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners	105.6228
your excellency he said the master of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz	42.9951
you know what it is to love my lord	24.2046
the unknown chapter	747.0921
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthoss duchess is dressed by her husbands clerks said dartagnan laughing	211.7181
are you not going tomorrow morning at six oclock louis to bathe at conflans	106.4678
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure	47.4403
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m	98.0174
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired	134.9904
good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor believe softspoken gentlemen again hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle	159.5764
against his temple	575.4466
read said the old man	14.0428
besides the woman wore that black mantle which dartagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer	69.8767
athos exclaimed dartagnan	52.8652
is m	240.4169
it is closed after them and they are arrested so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the establishment	64.4419
de tréville chapter iii	248.2463
groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company all four of us asked athos	73.5601
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	150.7124
de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely	93.9132
the snow was falling thick and icy	427.5657
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host	75.7759
besides the appearance of the caravan was formidable	85.2263
what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo	45.4089
the king savedwe shall assemble our friends togetherwe will head the puritansreconquer england we shall reenter londonplace him securely on his throne and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect	287.8568
although general dépinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments	1286.5984
the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saintdenis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station	270.8446
tomorrow night we shall rescue you how can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy	58.8724
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussels release	83.7366
really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease indeed you give me more credit than i deserve i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all when shall you send your invitations this very day well i will immediately call on m	128.7967
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches ah ah said groslow	105.2374
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saintmartin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren	153.4227
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk	126.2242
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône	71.5806
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire dangoisse	71.4590
even on the night of the princes return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville	122.6081
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church	131.7031
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell	81.4753
oh thats nothing let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very dangerous and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary	117.5040
he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything	108.1762
m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	96.1526
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	110.8617
at this moment villefort returned	26.9986
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god the presence of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses	143.7308
there was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais	148.5228
you would be the happier for it at home sire and i do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad monsieur duke said the king i understand you	70.1687
aramis and i are very unhappy but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us	165.2529
dartagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance	98.7300
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the papers	377.5023
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance	106.8917
yes my prince my prince interrupted dartagnan	190.6616
we can go to brussels liège aixlachapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg	372.5313
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it	77.9458
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began	145.8997
you were saying my dear friend no i said nothing yes you were saying you wished to leave this place ah indeed the will was never wanting to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall tis truei said so and i say it again and i answered you porthos that it was not a good	105.3978
plan that we couldnt go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves that is true we should need clothes and arms well said dartagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better bah said porthos looking around	108.1222
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head	164.4634
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem	98.0260
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	284.5482
anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash	202.4809
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands	129.0648
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you be it so then replied athos sorrowfully	122.3742
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession	87.0195
andrea cavalcanti	27.0803
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation	146.8574
poor athos said he he will never guess what all this means	74.5326
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	105.0764

and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility	555.4819
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob	451.6258
the man of meung replied dartagnan and disappeared	116.6479
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly onethird of the paper had been consumed by	186.3561
the flame	34213.5234
no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed	216.1781
the _moccoletto_ is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from god	201.2650
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba	121.4606
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused	41.1943
i am weeping with joy he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pontdugard	133.2934
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me i was wrong a hundred times wrong	48.8756
what is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the windswayed cloth he was holding back	74.9407
anne of austria took two steps forward	41.6426
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself	149.2453
and therefore said dartagnan to clip the hope which athoss tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you	172.6367
will so take it away from us noon the faith of a cardinal	140.4702
what is his birthplace	129.6315
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud grimaud replied athos	53.1207
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand	412.1222
this precipitationthis unusual appointment	3111.1880
tis well	24.9851
at five oclock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had	49.0788
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	86.4872
i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived	51.9755
call for me at eight oclock or shall i wait supper for you at seven that will do very well said aramis	74.2781
de villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman no excellency returned bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it go on that evening continued bertuccio i could have	55.8346
killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall	96.2719
of the garden	52.4231
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready	165.5706
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in she passed first	100.1481
she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saintméran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a soninlaws respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée	281.0113
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment	49.6323
m maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtiers eyes seemed to sayquicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentines	169.3315
how do you think these garments fit me wonderfully said dartagnan but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better what asked porthos	112.6288
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse yes truly dear friend and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly	106.9775
at that moment dartagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look	123.0476
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe	251.3856
the other day a bankers clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold caderousse was filled with wonder the young mans words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis	127.2585
she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out	71.0809
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been	152.1939
well asked the duke when they were alone	26.2181
thank you sir answered the young man much moved	31.0916
you have no longer a weapon and besides i am on my guard	38.5268
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety	76.3319
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary	244.6537
we will send my brothers servant back to béthune whom as i told you we can trust	112.6495
but my lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too far what do you say	76.0940
what are you doing asked the coadjutor	11.8435
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed	117.2874
you would love me then if you were not queen madame say that you would love me then i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped	78.1480
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	91.0476
i cannot hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever require stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to	175.5158
a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	156.5612
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner	88.1204
send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny well have a supper here under your direction hum said la ramee	95.9196
andrea read in a low voice you are poor a miserable old age awaits you	111.5368
de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted withone that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and	271.7861
her sweet exhortations	4009.4204
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what oclock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brothers having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre but jest as he might he gained nothing	250.7977
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times	106.8377
what he asked athos	66.4429
as to dartagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive	155.1966
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes	47.2703
you must know all your officersi mean those more distinguished why yes very nearly will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the chevalier dartagnan lieutenant in the musketeers no sir he is not with us he left paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to england i knew that but	123.0415
i supposed he had returned no sir no one has seen him	172.7066
you should have allowed me to sleep	40.3898
at this moment the clock struck eleven	34.0886
athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen bonacieux undergo	180.6094
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you sir sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies	157.1376
and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majestys service	99.1373
havent you some one who will relieve me of my horse groslow whistled and a sailor appeared	141.7534
what do i see cried the lieutenant	46.5606
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no i shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you i could not discover the others	74.3548
a dinner in the old style	136.8089
but all my fortune is in england	53.7937
lean a little to the left	127.9447
will that do yes what are you looking at i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that one would say you were carrying me off and they would be right _pardieu_ oh i think you swore eugénie and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest	123.0500
in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	261.8889
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back	40.2133
what is his name said he	12.1422
tis he it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness	94.6528
m such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m	86.7503
after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea	219.2851
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me	120.8524
oh i give you a hundred i give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit i received in your absence when about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de trévilles who has been here	69.1883
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror	246.3045
two hours passed thus	63.0105
bricconi muttered he	39.8402
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes	146.7599
de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieuxcolombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by dartagnana circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey	81.3092
dartagnan going to a distance to discover aramis	126.3232
bassompierre and schomberg against the duc dangoulême	50.2433
_one_ said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death	142.5814
this woman is certainly a great liar	140.8394
m	nan
gaetano departed with the reply	104.8734
he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound	101.3861
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself	662.9634
will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp	144.5455
do you know monsieur dartagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen	30.7623
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the peoples misery	204.4334
come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter	19.2714
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbés dead body	171.2506
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	84.4375
never mind	128.4459
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed	67.7184
at nine oclock the night had fully come	74.3209
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis	19.8522
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity	321.8865
fernands mind was made up he would shoot dantès and then kill himself	110.9983
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance	185.2570
madame said athos passing his arm under that of dartagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman	165.7592
as soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that convent but we must first learn what convent she is in thats true said porthos	141.1418
on your return you cannot make a mistake	62.1098
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the popes decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal	189.9611
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	303.7694
dartagnan to wait i shall have further need of him these words gave great joy to dartagnan	114.6229
with me you will be as safe as in a temple i give you my word of a gentleman let us go said she i place full confidence in you my friend dartagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered dartagnans chambers	119.7910
you have a calm strong mind maximilian	245.7002
you are right father i understand you then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for methanks morrel caught his hand	76.2400
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible	62.2498
the intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	244.3787
de saintméran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	138.6075
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk	217.9725
of being hissed which would be an act of folly however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m	92.6392
welcome to ye thanks my lord	137.3358
at about a league and a half from the city dartagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time	128.5130
dartagnan no longer doubted that this was porthoss pleasant dwelling place	358.0552
nothing nothing replied the priest go on it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added	106.9001
quicklyno one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eyewitness true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accomplice sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception	93.6264
let them wait for me at the pommedepin	52.9737
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly	82.0822
then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won	389.7448
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions	103.8353
for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime _ma foi_ i should like to smoke monte cristo took the gong and struck it once	87.7065
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble	113.1502
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	118.2393
i understand you or rather i am wrong	44.3606
noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair	146.3685
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dantès	65.2992
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away	221.5303
nevertheless raoul you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saintremy the youth looked pleased	120.5567
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athoss chamber and that of the park	54.6792
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so porthos looked at dartagnan with an expression of profound admiration	46.2853
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away	113.7643
everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board	122.6013
dartagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception	84.0300
chapter lxxxii	125.1491
monsieur dartagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns	54.8708
at the end of an instants observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw miladys carriage stop opposite to him	65.1732
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme	51.8576
i think he has not been arrested and as i am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is i shall know it too very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me we will be with you at six oclock my lord go my dear curate and may god assist you and you sir	70.3448
continued gondy turning to the curate of st sulpice	58.8704
emmanuel went towards the pistols	74.3036
it was the soul of my husbandwell if my husbands soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter	154.0896
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished	136.6222
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows	67.3464
now if you have them andrea took fiveandtwenty louis from his pocket	159.8155
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	146.7279
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences but who perpetrated that joke let me ask	157.2935
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on	203.3018
olivain we have come into possession of two horses but i have lost my own	49.8007
chapter xxi	51.2103
athos killed his adversary first	397.0483
pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves	818.5717
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right alberts breakfastroom looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden	60.9408
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay	331.7817
bridle in mouth said dartagnan	122.6482
did you come to noisy to defend him i am waiting for no one replied dartagnan who was beginning to be angry	38.3953
is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short	179.4686
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it	376.7204
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited	113.2720
bertuccio lay covers for three he then took franzs tablets out of his hand	359.0275
go on baptistin then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son you hearmajor bartolomeo cavalcantia man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of _the inferno_ you remember it do you not	204.8015
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them the scotch inquired winter	367.5900
morrels service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant	67.3068
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title	90.4657
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell	318.7780
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	175.9106
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution	155.4083
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my soninlaw i would give five	137.7969
and we would share the profits very good fatherinlaw said cavalcanti yielding to his lowborn nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it	183.0181
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself monsieur dartagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an _obolus_ for your life i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence	66.5367
goodmorning creditor said he for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me you are right baron answered m	194.9104
it is you mordaunt he said	59.6063
do you suppose that the real _savant_ addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual	336.1971
you would not have me marry under such sad auspices my child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future	369.9385
he took his fowlingpiece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids	73.2141
de villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color	189.1015
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart	167.9238
they are only four a joyous smile lighted porthoss face	450.7609
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin	110.1877
this evening the margin of possible delay expires what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them tonight pardieu we must go and look for them all right said athos	70.4159
the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m	67.4399
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme	103.3463
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened	65.7549
i think i understand his reason said morrel	77.0337
it was about nine oclock in the morning	10.9805
punctuality you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast has the ministry resigned no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the	171.7587
affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us ah true you drive don carlos out of spain no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans	166.7038
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house	182.0646
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping	267.9908
lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace	93.8925
gaetano lowered the sail and the boat came to rest	86.7983
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations indeed m	293.3734
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the twentysecond	54.0380
in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country	188.8976
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawingroom when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of	103.3334
gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child but i cant be severe with him he is really _so_ bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m	196.9216
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal	56.4233
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance	51.0789
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures	206.2851
have i friends	412.8167
i beg you to return me that dispatch dartagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact	166.2402
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner have you a spanish prisoner cried the prince	145.2824
louis xiv	48.9420
they are men who do nothing for nothing you know the only reply that i desire said dartagnan the only one worthy of you and of me and he drew nearer to her	104.0609
if i bore my proper title i should be a lord	125.2080
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	137.5836
you do not know the italian nobility the cavalcanti are all descended from princes have they any fortune an enormous one what do they do try to spend it all	203.9431
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late	58.7370
horrible replied raoul especially in expression yes yes said de guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost well said raoul the poor	347.0921
man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor	204.5082
that voice also was known to grimaud	180.4303
what do you say of this asked the queen	15.1217
i was like you and had a king in keeping aha said groslow what king our own to be sure the little onelouis xiv and how long had you to take care of him three nights and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure how do you mean i mean that my friends officers in the	123.0939
guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing ah true said the englishman with a sigh you frenchmen are born boon companions and dont you play too when you are on guard never said the englishman	189.5696
oh my god cried she my god are you going to drown me these cries had something so heartrending in them that m	98.7247
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss	46.3869
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of buckingham gave dartagnan a chamber adjoining his own	215.2777
this promise completed poor kittys consolation	10416.8174
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass and here is a book which contains the ritual at the manner in which felton laid the book	162.3151
upon the little table near which milady was sitting at the tone in which he pronounced the two words _your mass_ at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied them milady raised her head and looked more attentively at the officer	89.1332
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten oclock	43.1638
by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare	144.8127
he left the saucepan	151.3359
we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin lying between tulle and angoulemea little village called rochelabeille madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile	86.6226
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was all what brother cried milady must i name him again	207.0669
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple	84.8720
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars	166.6873

coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her	205.5149
indeed said athos	13.4120
well how is he now asked he	28.3598
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it	106.6295
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinals	176.7769
but dartagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	187.8790
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet	100.4356
on the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front	140.7667
de trévilles surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground	130.0384
the comte de la fere athos athos muttered dartagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman whither art thou going grimaud to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention	148.0582
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself dartagnan reached notre dame	422.2738
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start	161.3496
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way	36.8505
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey	108.5301

maximilians avowal at the same moment m	47.3818
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having	140.1294
myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her	69.5796
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious	90.8103
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville	266.0584
thats my room replied groslow	187.9014
m but then you are richvery rich indeed continued debray taking out some papers from his pocketbook which he spread upon the table	108.4731
it might be a vengeance of milady that was most probable	116.7898
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless	117.7586
be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank	136.6894
in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just	141.0734
assumed	nan
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time dartagnan was better informed than she was	109.7101

then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain	120.4705
athos replaced his in his belt porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards	103.7986
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence	493.9468
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give	65.5662
but how asked mazarin	73.6787

i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet oh answered another voice which dartagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis	132.3034
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	200.1874

without doubt she murmured	94.5242
cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone	80.3226
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos	52.2269
they talk of making him an ambassador m and what are his claims to the peerage he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the _siècle_ and voted five or six years on the ministerial side bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling you are a delightful _cicerone_	141.9103
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weaponswhich were very beautifulif not with envy at least with curiosity	56.9873
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	163.6901
the great man has called me his friend yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified	118.5480
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole good there is your money the same sum as that you have received already	160.3508

ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen private interests are as nothing before the interests of all	151.6710
he knew the abbé de gondy only by report	162.5656
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrinis side	80.4558
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked	165.6333
but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds	192.3802
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher	94.6960
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has said	102.3239
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses ones self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection	312.5647
louis xiii like every weak mind was wanting in generosity	587.4489

de tréville	2.9157
she did not please she intoxicated	207.9959
attend to yourself answer me dantès waited expecting a question but in vain	240.7618
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brotherinlaw monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers monseigneur is correctly informed said dartagnan	125.3715
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	358.7845

he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy	379.8665
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me possibly monsieur	52.3449
oh you do not understand me when i speak of ignominy you think i speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death	64.4753
rely on me dartagnan knew that although a gascon m	138.9334
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands	132.6990
ah said dartagnan i did not see that it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the breast you are wounded asked buckingham as he opened the letter	44.7548
if you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your wishes	97.3656

yes we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois as you know and we are going to give mazarin something to do	67.4658
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four oclock though he never spent the night there	262.9896

to be your man dartagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage	177.4335
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone	76.7024
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her	91.8741
truly a byronic hero franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfreds shoulders or beneath laras helmet	389.9097
dartagnan started on seeing these tears	111.4653
m at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door	42.9578
m dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice	497.6396
the queen breathed more freely	385.9017
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the first	36.7998
jealousy fury offended pride all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an outraged woman in love urged her to make a revelation but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that dartagnan would also be lost to her forever	129.5092

i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask	147.3448
davrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret	277.9294
the count seized it hastily his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph and he read thou shalt tear out the dragons teeth and shall trample the lions under foot saith the lord ah he exclaimed here is my answer	253.1652
but hush here comes our minister of justice he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen	173.9034

my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed	138.4411
from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	81.6292
taste that fowl and those fish	220.1745
i will not sleep where i must scorn	115.7994
comte de wardes not a word about the sapphire	55.7331

what do you want with me said she and why do you place your hand on me i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistresss face	68.2492
my words have not convinced you	223.4465
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another	113.0410
while jussac drew up his soldiers	172.8078
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not asked danglars carelessly they like to unite their fortunes it is usual certainly but cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people	316.3151
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction	149.6732
chapter xxxv	142.1068
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him teteatete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade	69.0756
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the waterit was the generals body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead	69.5536
then i believe you	20.5590
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear	893.5428
the days of expectation are long and dartagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour hours	350.9668
i appreciate your calm reasoning	2454.9238
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count	22.8457
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening	166.2135
dantès turned pale hesitated and reflected	183.3296
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology gentlemen gentlemen said dartagnan do not let us lose our time in jesting	107.7291
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	149.1967
you provide in accordance with paragraph a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work	65.0775
i as a tender father and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you whom do you mean by they _ma foi_ i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not yes from whom from a certain abbé busoni have you any knowledge of him	129.4939
no i have never seen him what did he say in the letter you will promise not to betray me rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young mans hand	74.0763
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone	78.9116

what is done is done	68.5098

up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury	379.1075
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived	242.4604
he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose	220.9678
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young mans countenance for an instant	51.9331
m	nan
that instant the arm of porthos fell	94.8818
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	162.1598
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn	52.4621
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m	72.3685
dartagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question	130.9722
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words	79.8984
stop a minuteah this is it timeo danaos et dona ferentes which means beware of the enemy who makes you presents this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied dartagnan it comes from the queen from the queen oh oh said m	137.9963
when he came up again the light had disappeared	48.4014
de jussac turned the corner of the convent	137.5874
dartagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called moustonwas it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which	209.6468
he was	8.6184
on him on him always on him yes you are right maximilian i will follow you	51.2752
my dear count you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed	92.9059
i dont very well know what but still something monseigneur said dartagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it	70.0253
dartagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau	28.1192
monsieur said mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master phoebus could no longer hold out and silence said porthos	110.9688
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydée seemed one of fire and blood	233.3105
he had stanched the wound and the man was better	83.2777
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion	49.7716
the whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea	123.3625
it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man	74.8494

another motive had influenced alberts selection of his seatwho knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival	202.4501

well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony m ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage	84.1282
who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with them what conditions	108.1209

there we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter but eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow	188.0330

the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest	111.3900

gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair players	72.1299
and you say that monsieur dartagnan was one of those four men he led the enterprise and who were the others i leave it to monsieur dartagnan to name them my lord	55.1615
now then go go in the name of heaven i was expected at sharp midnight and i am late by five minutes yes but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages when one loves well and who told you i had no affair with a lover it is a man then who expects you cried dartagnan	110.5553

came and sat down close to debray	67.8129
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in	119.8724
other directions	2218.8882
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing	79.9314
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them	183.0128
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg sainthonoré	64.9922
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and paper	103.5636
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de vaugirard	72.5604

morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on thats right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind	121.4159
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges	242.3061
he then concluded it must be an assassin	98.8566
the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him	62.8556
on the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_ who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly	140.8913
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder	76.1493
valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again	156.9570
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner	68.4430
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure	161.4648

what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not i replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte cristo oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place	98.8376
for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it	74.5638
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year	84.8194
this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead	168.9901
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at dartagnan who was riding toward him at full speed	89.8214
there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter	180.8047

dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea	37.8065

when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you	197.8728
ah these musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be hanged no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire ill be their warranty	163.3256

as to the duc de bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the duc delbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff	97.0925
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told raoul bowed	78.9258
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of spahis cannot risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world you see my	93.5404

this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the countthis letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry monte cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight	76.9142
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	90.8438
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask grimaud yes but beer asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english	255.4101

the vow expires now what are we to do with you said the captain	86.9492

paralyzed frame	1308.0321
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting these words redoubled the eagerness of dartagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace	143.2308
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak	115.6964

instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine _strychnos colubrina_ as the learned term it	381.7750

they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation	75.7843

franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a restingplace and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down	99.9726

this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word	257.4796
are you a man	9.0570
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that dartagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two	103.9278
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground	217.8846
well in that case we can manage famously said dartagnan which of the two horses will you ridethat which you bought or the one that was given to you that which was given to me assuredly	127.5547
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph	148.2814

well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths	163.4152
this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth	145.9380
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage we are supposed not to know each other you are right	52.6845
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear dherblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by dartagnan the division	124.7477

as complete as that of the bridge of ce four men one of them wounded and a youth say you one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself dartagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest	147.3714
friendsthe son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well	94.9523

the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments	102.4156
debray has just seen you at my house ah true fix it this way	71.1119
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	110.8755
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m	105.6297
today is the twentieth of september	26.7445

lift it and judge if i am mistaken the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless	93.5204
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man	226.6207
i should not like to be groslow if he meets him well said athos to the man in english	82.8940
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard	109.8689

additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work	30.1510
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him	55.1123
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery	115.2449
before his death had placed in the hands of aramis	49.6229
so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness itself yes you will much oblige me go into my study here and i will show it to you and they both entered m	112.3929
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for but why did it not kill my father i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saintmérans deathbecause his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because	152.7253

you had nothing left oh yes my friend there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which i had observed yesterday this diamond said dartagnan placing his hand eagerly on his ring	111.5043
very good said the count	8.7679
you will find him quite enthusiastic upon what subject asked madame danglars	108.9502
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	445.8588
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection	129.2760
and now said la ramee i must ask your highnesss pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimauds eyes	73.3588
edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers	86.1639
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop	20.7145
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies	420.9599
do you think of dying my lord said she	27.3562
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	57.3798

this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that dartagnans adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fighta part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon	172.6046
these gascons replace him on his orange horse and let him begone not before i have killed you poltroon cried dartagnan making the best face possible and never retreating one step before his three assailants who continued to shower blows upon him	285.5226
vampa took cucumettos body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained outside	119.0621
it would quite cut me up you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus	243.0955
my dear planchet i am the happiest of men and i may profit by monsieurs happiness and go to bed yes go may the blessings of heaven fall upon monsieur but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of dartagnan had not entirely effaced	103.8099
he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others then he added monsieur you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must	222.2070
do my duty m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where villefort had left him	86.2807
it is my fault madame said raoul	38.7523
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act	265.7117
in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly it is quite frightful	242.6588
but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention	165.5365
she saw davrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night	163.0331
where am i exclaimed she and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady	186.9828
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be watched toward four oclock in the morning the doctor arrived but since the time milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed	166.6073

franz coolly cocked both barrels	9969.6543

he then said it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine oclock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at halfpast eight by his timepiece entered the cloverfield while the clock of saintphilippeduroule was striking eight	115.2689
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre	85.5749
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	127.3489

adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him adieu and think of me oh for ever and ever cried the youth oh i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained	141.1571
with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses	290.0376
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	85.7890

a hundred writers since socrates seneca st augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a fathers sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son	325.9354

he again arose and went to the door	21.5656
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry	119.7344
oh you are a man of god sir cried caderousse for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it which said the abbé to himself you would have done the abbé rose took his hat and gloves	52.6293
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	51.9315
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless	175.2606

villefort looked at valentine as they said this	84.2788
shall you be present in the receptionroom no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office	97.1294
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	37.9962
devoted men are so rare tréville by the back staircase	458.2187
dont you think the executioner might be master cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself ah just so	205.1662
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of dartagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away	120.1515
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man	140.7180

bonacieux and then when bonacieuxs cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which	124.3277
eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city	98.3980
i hope so was the reply	127.6605
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you	46.2964
de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the château dif but what are you doing	39.4885

the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged	95.0062

while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and	60.2824
yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could m	141.8339
dear valentine well would you believe it	155.8805
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	78.3384
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees	151.2209
i will swear to you by my souls salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth	114.0933
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	88.0361
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	94.8380
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that	117.3894
reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much	89.5221
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so	13.8099

instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any resistance	209.8182
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the	152.3118

his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city	441.3423

then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the counts chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened	251.8594
speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort	177.2294
was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg sainthonoré	59.9806
follow you cried bonacieux follow you at this hour where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance	108.9734
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward	128.2882
de tréville who made some advances on their pay but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all	155.5450
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago when are you to pay half the th of this month half the th of next just so and now here are francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned	140.3099

in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me	68.0646
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal m i understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	201.2463
ah	nan
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m	78.7114
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	224.7176
let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts	131.9325
but athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty	192.3821
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the banknotes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple	167.6245
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers	115.0065
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring the goldsmith knew the duke	200.3737
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas	98.0819
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du	179.8229
vieuxcolombier to the luxembourg	27.5417

on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away	83.8209
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	99.9708

noirtier	nan
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness	122.7554
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger	77.5183
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence	97.8603
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks	146.6437
with regard to dartagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet	94.9567
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side whence can it arise then	161.5803

my dear bazin said dartagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger	119.9410

besides you must have seen that the person to whom i spoke was a woman that is true but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that since she lodges with him that does not concern me but who is she oh that is not my secret my dear madame bonacieux you are charming but at the same time	50.1438

then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice	234.4575
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched	89.0030
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no rue du helder st may halfpast ten in the morning now then said the count	162.9598
returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your timepiece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself shall i see you again ere my departure asked albert	153.2684
he seated himself at his desk and dartagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter	72.4125
she must have spoken she must have confessed everythinga woman is so weak a dungeon the first he comes to thats it a night is soon passed and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows oh my god my god have pity on me without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m	136.8248

it was time for the jailer was coming	34.3081
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence	909.1257
you believe so i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them that is unfortunate returned monte cristo	73.5617

yes my lord apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier dherblay now the abbé dherblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled	74.1791
it appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy what do you mean sir i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion	102.0150
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof	126.9421

the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal	84.3323
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground	115.7902
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale	19.9786

and went out without saying anything	130.0240
adieu sir one wordone single word more doctor you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me	174.4476
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and dartagnan remained master of the field of battle	80.5972
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv no you are right my dear rochefort it couldnt be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon ah indeed i forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know	98.9719

you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you grimaud bowed	70.0094
the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracytis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is	205.0244

what do you mean cried dartagnan	10.5640
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries	229.5512
then you will start after the queen no said mazarin again	78.4807

ay but it is for the first time madame i did not say france my lord i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a frenchman but did you see the queen it is useless replied henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no	47.4121
come my brother go with me added dartagnan and i will see that you are made a duke no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy to that i can say nothing returned dartagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron	114.1580
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court whom the abbess knew perfectly by name touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the duke of buckingham	133.8067

i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me athos was more delighted than can be told	221.4325
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened athos you are becoming mad no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur dherblay and myself to madame henrietta	197.9565
i will repair it indeed i will my dear porthos besides what did i ask of you resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship	92.5968
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse	460.9969
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits	290.7495
certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again mazarin felt a shiver run through hima chill even to his hearts core	153.3106
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of	169.0268

coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat	99.5462
dartagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brilliants	132.7992
this time i have merely come from cadiz you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit	127.2261
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square	74.6538
i believed you dead why did i survive you	154.4575
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn	138.9290
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy tis his custom	251.4171
still you must breakfast somewhere but if i am not hungry said the young man	50.8945

m	nan
dartagnan porthos he exclaimed	438.6166
well said franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure laugh if you pleasei really think so	84.9875
first my lord inquired grimaud	143.7158
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of	169.0795
a fanatic would save france yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known no for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they were	208.0703
although dartagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words	286.0825
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste	86.5765
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven oclock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	148.8869
i am a straightforward simple man thats my great disadvantage	163.8723
and i a plain chicken said aramis	340.2399
dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels	119.4018
de tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort levêque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him	152.4379
but _à propos_ resumed m	837.3804
everything was ready at ten oclock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse	95.4766
what must come is written monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening quite the contrary planchet the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy then that is monsieurs determination undeniably my friend	247.6612
wait said athos	14.8801
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused	186.1377
it was midnight	241.2100
be satisfied replied felton he will not sail milady started with joy	165.5901
one might believe the queen was about to speak	31.2658
de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe	48.0621
cardinal i must have the queens papers but how to take them sire	125.2754

his lips to those of the prisoner	110.2868
at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only francs left	54.9826
well said beauchamp we shall see our friend yes indeed replied debray	50.8653
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before	125.6504
since you demand my resignation i retire then said aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	208.0002
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo	91.2181
villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities he then took villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thickest	174.3837

some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered	300.3510
for sale	13754.8682
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted	402.9174
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars	90.7720
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel	35.4528
a surgeon cried m	360.4648
come come choose your part replied jussac	252.4635
m yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm you are astonished i see for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me	221.0378
thanks to m	19.3649
what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground	202.7975
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these neverending labors	190.6918
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis	87.3227
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine paintingbrush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before	120.6068

no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for vengeance	305.7789
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music	215.2574
as you please he said death is always deaththat is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him	168.6092
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest	149.1934
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said dartagnan	12.8705
it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression	22.6843

that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you ah bah said dartagnan you have at some wicket of the louvre a _concierge_ who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme	110.7157

long time since i visited my castles forget them for a time we shall return to them unless mazarin razes them to the ground do you think that likely no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it you reconcile me dartagnan well then assume a cheerful manner as i do we must	159.7887
joke with the guards we must gain the goodwill of the soldiers since we cant corrupt them	158.3407

dartagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his example	37.3449

the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows	157.9832
every one arose	158.1551
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal	65.1590
when they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork	103.4694
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	506.7198
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive	114.0784
it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in or to take account of the details i describe	58.3156
the comte de wardes was announced and dartagnan was introduced	45.1762
let me see it said milady	22.8523
grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself	37.3349

are you ready sir he said at last	25.8995
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	113.9377
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch	147.4321
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid	281.1839
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	118.7813
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs	270.0114

as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by dartagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over	83.9251
the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves	282.0198
would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him	111.8414
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m	134.6879
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had	161.7178
extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	88.3172

the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of	226.0955

ay and observeit just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the antichrist well said milady	291.1241
my lord said dartagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time	42.0007
and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune	189.7581
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power	171.1542
it is well sir replied villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side	96.5205

m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	174.5903

you here sir he exclaimed do you then never appear but to act as an escort to death busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrates face the savage lustre of his eyes he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes but beyond this he was ignorant	152.3301
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved confidence and love made him a giant	151.2953
never said dartagnan	46.5181
de villeforts office	94.3130
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move	61.0991
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her dartagnan would have returned home since he had so promised	73.9885
rest yourself mother he said	378.0957
her will be done like that of god in all things then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part	99.5651
chapter xxviii	51.4758
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse	86.7993
well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied	191.6157
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowla piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst	155.9791
châteaurenaud and albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin	75.9835
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier	58.2671
hold hold i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were i open them again and i see what you are nowa hundred times more beautiful what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless	113.7104
passion with such remembrances and upon what then must i live	163.3119
oh my god what has he done	39.2229
yes said he at length it is so	21.9180
the wife of athos chapter xxviii	112.5094
many small donations to are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs	140.7872
bonacieux darting to the window can it be he milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss	121.4491
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds i have nonenor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts what has happened	211.7760
said the count simulating total ignorance	832.7999
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination	153.2787
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide for	150.3784
very well cried dartagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since	264.8467
we must die only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said dartagnan	133.7603
the prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse	169.8655
never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully	246.0246
well how is it with this madman exclaimed he turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host who came in to inquire if he was unhurt	57.4763
will you assure me it shall not be signed yes said noirtier	61.3585
edmonds hair stood on end and he rose to his knees	84.8260
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villeforts said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke	183.5549
then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air	33.4227
his hands of which he took little care were the despair of aramis who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil	292.2548
de tréville mine the kings the best a surgeon or sblood my brave athos will die at the cries of m	260.4664
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming the puritan then went out	179.8051
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos	253.7432
we are rich	44.3162
de trévilles	58.1006
do you understand thats no doubt very fine said porthos but deuce take me if i understand at all porthos my friend you know i am descended on the fathers side from the prophets and on the mothers from the sybils and that i only speak in parables and riddles	134.9099
i know him well there and what did the officers do four conveyed him away i dont know whereto the bastille or fort levêque	193.1036
they seemed awaiting orders	1900.9977
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions	272.3160
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive	745.8545
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your masters head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you	112.8421
take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord	105.1577
i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin	113.1618
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh	41.4962
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother	93.6287
the abbé took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond	223.5068
now we are on the very road which all the vessels between dover and calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north that said athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were	173.1167
upon the other side of the atlantic which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis	38.7202
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome	38.7470
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves this place if monsieur dherblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer	121.1070
oh said dartagnan we dont now make war as we did formerly	174.2119
maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances	147.7339
recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	53.9068
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange gravediggers had heard his cry	165.3390
what to me were all the treasures in the world or all the kings of the earth eight days after i was back again madame	106.2936
no its odor charms one of my sensesthat is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it	164.2281
thats very kind of him here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man	22.6796
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring	98.6243
but to you dartagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend	113.4863
have two riding horses ready	3537.5691
what to dinner said dartagnan	161.0635
i think nothing my friend but all things are possible	100.6482
oh no i remember too well	66.6934
he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself	81.9651
it is then the cardinals custom to walk in his orangery asked dartagnan	101.1263
coquenard whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new	273.3431
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows	164.8352
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady	59.5505
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly	128.4600
what was there in it a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the musketeers indeed exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger	64.2968
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl	38.4487
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by dartagnan	174.5807
franz was deeply affected	240.3476
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took	109.7627
the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it	133.5100
may be true	46.7057
but hark hark there he is somebody has disturbed him without doubt said dartagnan	284.8472
but he must be disturbed cried the host here are two english gentlemen just arrived well well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the best	173.7195
by this smile m	231.6957
i shall always love you be sure of that	52.2657
there were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated	118.8533
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	78.7023
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey	57.5902
there he said is our road the deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis	70.6715
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument are you mad la ramee	260.9039
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that dartagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois	149.9081
are these persons then so rich and powerful do you not know their history i do not	82.5497
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children	136.5991
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french	119.6064
sign my lord sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke	54.9371
you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person and that you know is fernand	181.5045
dartagnan therefore followed mme	322.6823
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house	109.2859
cavalcanti to him andrea no bartolomeo his father now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly what is it sir do you know with what design m	116.1036
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the illhumor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which	99.6762
women frequently cannot account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	164.5426
the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony	99.2137
but said dartagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money	98.3076
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away	94.1113
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one other woman who can do it as well	167.7413
noirtier	nan
and madame de villefort which they deserve do they not i believe they do	125.4942
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated	69.7756
from whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence from general oliver cromwell said the new comer	185.0494
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber	88.2876
i have another commission for you m	90.6113
until this day and for how long a timehe had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness	128.8354
return to greenwich and bring them here	55.3127
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	150.7260
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans	60.6277
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the _ennui_ he may experience	120.8647
come here grimaud said athos	40.4396
the cold sweat sprang forth on dantès brow	362.5064
perhaps you would prefer being alone no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the operaballs	137.7049
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate	281.0225
it was three oclock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of francs	157.7294
the next two days passed in much the same way	81.0401
as he had twenty times touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand street he went there to have his beard and hair cut	204.2664
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips	82.3841
and youfellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte dartagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop	147.1719
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door	67.4569
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure	210.4645
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment	54.9193
de morcerf he sent us word this morning replied châteaurenaud that he would meet us on the ground ah said morrel	76.4586
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets	163.1502
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds aramis porthos cried athos and laughed aloud	236.1880
do you know monsieur de tréville their captain oh yes him i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however	102.7734
valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i cannot reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan with chagrin	58.3335
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up	78.0726
it is the first time he has ever been in paris	20.4781
you have received a regular letter of advice yes said danglars but i confess i didnt quite comprehend its meaning indeed and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation go on monsieur	103.0287
some ham my boy or we cant drink and her brother added dartagnan timidly	295.7417
project gutenberg is a registered trademark and may not be used if you charge for an ebook except by following the terms of the trademark license including paying royalties for use of the project gutenberg trademark	24.8190
i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality	123.5734
m m	51.8724
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame and by whom	45.6020
what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m	152.1155
raoul is gone to blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key	111.5328
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellowsufferer to share his supper	94.5871
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please god to france where at least i understand the architecture of the houses so suiting the action to the word dartagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others	110.0610
from this phrase dartagnan awakened planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly come	259.8726
really i think the thing very difficult not at all cried dartagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary i think it very easy	69.2952
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath	78.1207
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m	77.9590
and now said athos what is to be done	14.5866
how much do you want all you have in gold i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts i have as much	56.8426
straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found i can show you answered the gascon	168.4363
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet	78.0761
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	84.4655
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del montecattini here is the priests certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment	165.0523
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queens disposal	94.4703
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the halfopen door and told his master that the horses were ready	61.6131
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m	247.0282
and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfathers presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid	83.2773
goodmorning emmanuel you will come with me then maximilian did you doubt it said the young captain	65.1732
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate dartagnan milady was livid	120.4140
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m	406.9976
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed dartagnan aside with his hand	100.1479
nevertheless he understood it all but was deaf	196.8958
no said danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer	109.2826
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound has he been wounded then oh	130.4107
good lord what have i said you said that porthos had received a sword cut yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so and why so zounds monsieur because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him	122.6857
on his back	150.2303
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	69.9074
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	138.7148
these cannot be for us said athos	56.1727
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the housethe only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day	52.6831
chapter vi	282.5721
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned	96.1271
from his own happiness to destroy that of another	116.5570
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents sign it continued the count	119.6477
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman	190.0637
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum	132.2484
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out	37.4462
the count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions	662.8165
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	333.3440
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy	115.7729
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim oh no monsieur dartagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you eh egad love me too i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and	69.0811
a hearty frondist too but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse i should say you could and the coadjutor and madame de longueville and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks well sir i will obey you although i	130.2278
do not understand you it is unnecessary for you to understand	32.5758
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago ah _mon dieu_ exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for francs well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills then said monte cristo here are	110.4283
francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m	457.9791
in the position of porthos dartagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make porthos contented there was wantingwhat	106.0941
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of what proofs do you require did you in the year or know anything of a young sailor named dantès dantès	57.8940
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m	88.7094
m	nan
on tuesday the theatres open at ten oclock in the morning as lent begins after eight at night	172.8210
alas i understand think of the offense you have committed toward me madame it remains _here_ said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly	96.5195
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible	123.1213
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue	346.8099
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinalhis physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur	77.0159
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper	167.9274
penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he recovered	438.0225
he then formed a resolution	240.9173
i would rather have had a hat said dartagnan	113.1950
morrel and i adore mercédès	274.3484
i have extricated you from misery felton i have caused you to be named lieutenant i once saved your life you know on what occasion	141.8345
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment why so	47.5849
have the fugitives been pursued yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted how many are there four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded four said dartagnan looking at porthos	252.8224
the peasants were in great commotion	278.0452
planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side	57.7274
i know not where i have left my hat and in all probability i should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this madame said la meilleraie do	80.9223
not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all i wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back yes madame but i only came back on one conditionthat	109.6956
i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people the will exclaimed the queen frowning	145.0346
what makes you believe this why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me	176.5709
go then and find them what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence you know them better than i	68.8339
the kings attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioners knife	229.7883
the carnival was over	151.5178
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a mans stout and furious thundered behind dartagnan	147.6768
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you dartagnan and i give you absolution beforehand	176.2983
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her	338.5180
fifty thousand francs muttered la carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune volume two m m m chapter	87.7133
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all knowpoor franz dépinay ah true said debray you did fight some time ago about what m the devil take me if i remember returned châteaurenaud	168.9980
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days	403.4382
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine no and yet you say he has sent you some as from us here is his letter said dartagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	114.9968
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much planchet shook his head and said nothing	74.1842

albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow	134.1670
allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied madame de villefort with all a mothers real firmness	120.1588
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter	31.1545
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	54.5746
it is not here m and then he moved farther on and began again to dig	126.5427
twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was m	440.0269
do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you	74.9728
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any illfeeling might have arisen from their being of opposite partiesyour father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor	204.3396
there could not possibly be any other difference between them	68.5821
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing	98.9392
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything	115.7266
for two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense but once free and placed in communication with laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days earlier	203.3572
no replied athos and he oh he now we may say at last thank heaven he is really dead	124.4504
de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company	264.0226
signor pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent bréguet bearing the name of its maker of parisian manufacture and a counts coronet	235.3330
follow me then said the abbé as he reentered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès	45.0900
debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays herdebray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he	139.2112
he was incessantly attacked by them and the superior to whom he had confided this misfortune wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them had advised him in order to conjure away the tempting demon to have recourse to the bell rope and ring with all his might	166.5867
well cried dartagnan tell us all about it _dame_ thats a long job monsieur you are right planchet said athos besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others so be it said dartagnan	158.7513
adieu my dear cousin	27.8793
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department	185.3426
by the way i have received news of franz have you	74.5812
have you had another fall at the bourse no i am safe for a few days at least	79.0656
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him	35.9141
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so	64.3737
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette	17.1948
he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal the guards of the cardinal and why so asked porthos warmly	73.9994
a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation to whom does this island belong to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with	133.5084
an incredulous smile	1333.8428
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness happy father happy son said the count	72.9367
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme	74.7841
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the _pharaon_ is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have	83.4164
perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ships owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars	232.5359
coquenard drew the dish toward her skillfully detached the two great black feet which she placed upon her husbands plate cut off the neck which with the head she put on one side for herself raised the wing for porthos and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in who disappeared with it before the musketeer had	147.3540
time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it	250.3848
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house then you abandon me doctor yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold	92.7043
dartagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were fired	91.8198
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos	142.2755
the project gutenberg ebook of the count of monte cristo illustrated this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever	39.3105
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond	133.8836
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else the devil all this is very sad which you tell me what will you	47.7725
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	318.5484
well all that was useless	165.9517
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears	63.6879
edmond found some solace in these ideas	249.1220
well said the queen it has been refused the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	51.5941
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top	327.0018
not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes	109.5672
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude	110.7714
the assizes chapter	162.2144
he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackneycoach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband	136.9002
there it is all bloodstained on the desk as a testimony of the crime ah very good hush gentlemen here is the court let us go back to our places a noise was heard in the hall the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem and the doorkeeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since	171.9066

this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was	61.3149
chapter lxv	39.1716
i dont say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming true how so why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal	252.7675
will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny	155.9317
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side	118.0513
in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into france and to live here as a private individual	148.1176
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame	139.7859
he was softened	269.4403
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	175.7817
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort i would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as i believe him entirely capable of the descent bravo by what sign tomorrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes every frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat good give the watchword do you want money	186.3689
money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag	191.8374
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	182.1506
you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely the poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts	231.2593
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars	65.8438
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request noirtier made a sign that they did	51.0561
at last they reached the tennis court	91.4859
no country can say it saw my birth	529.7408
you see he has a truly royal escort ay theres no fear in the daytime but at night we redouble our precautions and what method of surveillance do you employ eight men remain constantly in his room the deuce he is well guarded then	263.4568
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise	68.6391
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme	165.6417
i am brave when i set about it	125.2046
the major will bring his son with him this evening the _contino_ as we say in italy he confides him to my care	135.0464
the tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey	70.3654
ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage	70.3522
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad	110.1827
and towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said morcerf turning pale with anger	139.3497
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort	492.2741
neffer neffer dartagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out	136.9731
dartagnan let me confess to you what ive been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes speak out answered dartagnan	197.2992
chapter lxxv	192.8602
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	56.6118
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be a man women weep for the dead men avenge them oh yes cried dartagnan yes if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you athos profited	129.2264
by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior	56.3365
but consider dartagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	164.3384
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice	255.4156
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarinonce that of cardinal richelieu	91.0559
the rumor of edmonds arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city	209.5326
yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity i can do it said porthos	105.2987
delirium he repeated delirium do you say	106.2358
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock	130.1010
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open	90.5619
athos required no more	229.3698
this is what i propose to do said athos	39.8126
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal	103.2047
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things	359.7553
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise and the young officer shook the counts hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure	75.1739
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champsélysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel	174.8629
they arrived at ablain without accident	73.3299
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter	111.0928
planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at armentières	41.4199
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold	64.3336
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis	113.3124
oh mon dieu no nothing at all	121.4635
what for demanded porthos	696.9611
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause	115.4960
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling	184.8700
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire	73.0404
two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal	245.1895
and you are happy he said to his friend	23.8604
have you killed the cardinal	21.9958
have you observed said he to them what a bloodred color the moon has tonight no replied athos i thought it looked much the same as usual look again chevalier returned lord winter	215.2617
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion	184.2761
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus	232.0920
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty	223.6647
but how shall i address the minister sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dictate will you be so good certainly	119.2180
i think so am i not right m	129.4968
they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannonball to the feet and then threw them into the sea	121.0882
he clapped his hands three timesthe ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo	368.6931
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these wordsfrom lord ruthven to countess g precisely i was sure of it said morcerf	106.7792
what is he waiting for	20.4749
do you know of what he died asked davrigny placing his hand on noirtiers shoulder	43.5802
oh you are an angel exclaimed the young man	16.3438
de tréville being paid the pensive dartagnan took the longest way homeward	498.6132
they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers brave young man murmured the king	103.0348
oh for pitys sake said she you will live will you not no on my honor said maximilian but that will not affect you	61.9678
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy	84.2192
and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it	95.7485
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it m go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	72.1086
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention	162.6091
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance	297.7131
have you lost it asked blaisois	63.5966
you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator	144.9673
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done	68.4221
maximilians avowal chapter	692.4061
while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franzs attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant	155.9869
on the evening of the twentyfifth as they were entering arras and as dartagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris	62.1233
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	314.6737
bravo bravi brava the banker was enthusiastic in his applause	578.3330
i hate you all but not equally	218.4090
to troyes in champagne i answered	580.4053
is it mazarins proximity that makes you so prudent oh you hear that flamarens said chatillon	257.1744
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there	122.8365
speak said the monk	24.4584
bazin was stationed in the corridor and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that after many years of trial bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been ambitious	97.9590
the lattera pretty girl of about twenty or twentytwo years active and lively the true _soubrette_ of a great ladyjumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which dartagnan had perceived lubin	158.9439
de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess	118.5730
exactly and you have that letter of the cardinal said dartagnan	39.7142
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes	21.8296
thats lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders	35.0076
no replied mousqueton parry kept it	558.5715
emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered	420.7936
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring	72.3174
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m	347.5260
they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel now you get angry and attack our poor agents	268.1385
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight	161.0061
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office	60.7976
ah locked he exclaimed these devils of english how suspicious they are locked said blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset locked repeated mousqueton	454.0550
with two companions yes replied the duke	65.0622
the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword but the name of m	102.0461
what is the matter asked milady	9.5742
in a few hours they were in the capital	32.0255
then my dear sir i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also	75.9431
the pretty mme	7130.6260
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day	100.2924
you wish to speak to me alone said the marquis	25.8299
however there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my lord indeed explain to me	88.3647
suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket	44.2273
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them but i am unable to leave london for want of money	98.1616
as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed	179.1729
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès	52.0957
dépinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart	85.9413
aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme	103.5611
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour	81.6577
this movement revealed the spot where winters body had fallen	232.7361
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that dartagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so	124.1283
as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheardof things which were taking place	147.1785
de châteaurenaud m that is quite my opinion said the gentleman nothing induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn thank you gentlemen replied albert with a smile of indifference i shall follow your advicenot because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france	150.5724
dantès made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist	70.2651
i cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with a packthread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds no but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blaisois	177.6169
qualities for which he did not give him credit	36.2742
it was delightful weather	351.9636
my sword is shorter than yours its true but bah i think the arm will make up for the sword halt cried porthos coming forward	204.9915
do as you like she said i rely upon you will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command sir what do the people want this time demanded the king	113.7018
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application m sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness	145.6665
la ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes i will go in your stead i will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition i will return to prison monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud well i am wrong	67.2368
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened	234.5195
but i am sure of one thingthat those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time here goes the barony said the queen she signed a patent	135.7375
how badly	9016.7070
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	535.2577
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	92.0501
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked dartagnan	288.4701
athos look at mordaunts smile	778.6274
it was in the rue des francebourgeois close to la force	85.0943
adieu then and be of good courage said athos	76.0343
if so speak out answered athos	818.7770
well i shall write to the abbé i shall hold him responsible for his _protégés_ misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination	87.5001
open the door the captain obeyed	35.4575
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap	65.1432
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	220.6637
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is monsieur dartagnan and his friends he will bring them to us he knows them then doubtless	65.1578
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the kings wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them	233.2338
upon that athos yielded	407.1340
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it	64.7539
a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the _barberi_	258.3637
excellency cried the _cicerone_ seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him	139.3216
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascons uneasiness	351.8852
we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo	24.5344

ah said aramis but you forget the officer dartagnan grew pale with rage	69.7873
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german	140.6359

my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and recounted is odious to me	650.6538
dartagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarins bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the ministers finger that night	128.3961

athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that dartagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not dartagnan	93.1044

ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving dartagnan how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man	51.9930
emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to fiveandtwenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rosetree raised her head	225.3550

save me oh no said he but help me to die if you can are you a priest asked raoul	45.0588

there were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself	95.7190

hold hold hold said athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is extraordinary	440.2891
that is a serious thing monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said	98.9154

an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire	252.4327

he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winters head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast	111.2474
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out	125.3671

at length they arrived at the cemetery	19.6318
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor	84.1690
happily he did not meet anyone	92.8206
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	119.6345
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move	166.0867
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked dartagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england	104.5191
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of henrietta maria	136.9618
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone	65.0442
the day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise	128.9564
what do you say said louise	20.7121
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent	297.2130
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i dont know my way	108.5915
the baron dépinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him	72.5604
adieu till we meet again apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make dartagnan shudder but dartagnan could now	114.2272
see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt it matters little now to me	197.2778
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded	231.9037
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it tomorrow raoul didnt wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a piebald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him	273.8396
to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse	106.4127
the young woman complied	149.2680
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice	365.1273
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears	126.3026

albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champsélysées to the house of monte cristo	69.1303
the daughter of ali pasha of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki and your slave _ma foi_ yes but how did she become so why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople wonderful really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which	129.7985
you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream	389.9945
at this order given in athoss habitually calm manner the face of the gascon relaxed and porthoss brow grew smooth	369.3348
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend said porthos	27.4356
my first impressions were favorable to the minister i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved dartagnan made a sign with his head which	134.7453
indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim	561.8556
and what does it concern thenmy captivity i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited you speak very much at your ease	124.7549
madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him	281.1834
danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions	184.6123
let us take our precautions athos but suppose they come unarmed	165.7547
dartagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	102.3474
guillotine	nan
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	252.5771
no well i shall see him tomorrow and tell him about you but im afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos	136.0173
but what _have_ you done asked franz	89.4596
women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock	365.3862

let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds _ma foi_ my dear sir replied franz make no apologies	128.2756
milady appeared to have entirely recovered	138.0334
bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of châteaurenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever	138.6703
in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	208.1137
availing himself of a handle that projected from a halffallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his ironshod stick	144.5067
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	141.9941
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear	52.2119
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persias sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor	303.4751
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse the three friends remained mutefor although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances	97.9901
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel	81.1519
nay said caderousse one cant always workone is not a dog so much the better for the dogs said monte cristo	83.7375
it is to pass the carnival at venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages ah the devil no cried albert i came to rome to see the carnival and i will though i see it on stilts bravo an excellent idea	138.8627
this itinerary possessed another great advantagethat of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrinis story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up	184.3067
all four once more together	575.5366
caderousse had once more parted with his treasurethe banknotes were replaced in the pocketbook the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard	179.6759
speak the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before	78.2747
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of	108.9922
your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures	101.4510
grimaud alone was calm as ever	116.8511
villefort placed the arm of madame de saintméran within his own and conducted her to his apartment	50.5215
what the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of death	189.7650
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m	215.5781
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the _semaphore_ this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office	80.3049
you will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man	212.7298
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet wellpitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum	122.9594
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count	146.0571
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do	117.4265
still more i dont doubt	94.4762
from seven oclock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates and an hour before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged	54.2333
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at dartagnan hatefully	27.9991
morrel back	39086.3008
the fortune of war my dear viscountthe caprice of fortune that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for and is her name a secret as regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friends and on whose silence i feel i may rely if i	108.1865

while he was endeavoring to calm his fearsand instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long sleptthe noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged	148.6270
person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their masters grief	254.1575
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc	133.9489
mousqueton was seasick	563.8449
ah monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of you bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my conversation bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went out	86.0600
de trévilles entrance he turned round	76.7569
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong	194.3713
at one end was the receipted bill for the francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment _julies dowry_	155.6402
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome	92.9453
this gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger	76.8738
dartagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking halfpast eight	97.6651
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes	296.2962
it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future fatherinlaw who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron	128.1606
four hundred and seventyfive livres said dartagnan who reckoned like archimedes	193.5774
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship	167.9665
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another	128.6224
mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her	24.9687
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream	619.2885
well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt what love asked the young girl	34.8101
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks	150.1189
he looked at dartagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them	78.2514
a small vessel with an english crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of charente at fort la pointe	192.0072
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter	265.4162
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously	39.5281
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey	77.4521
my faith it was time that idea came into porthoss head	208.0013
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so	110.0314
in england lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation by whom then were we beaten asked porthos	260.9666
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong	70.9304
but what help is there for it a captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family	119.0826
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galleyslave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m	198.8902
ay that smells good you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers	133.9645
on reaching the door he bowed	33.8073
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars	106.7736
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him	41.4530
repassed the bidassoa	593.2766
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point	149.8148
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each	222.5098
it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way if we have no news of them this evening tomorrow we must start athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condéhas he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis	104.0882

if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistakenmaximilian started as if he had been electrified	107.7543

then sitting down by the fire my supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite well done carlini cried the brigands that is acting like a good fellow and they all formed a circle round the fire while diavolaccio disappeared	169.2889
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbors orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my	259.5244

so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guidemarks were	255.5585
the morning drum had just been beaten everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the inn	233.6018

then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling	148.2139
now said dartagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it i hope the accident has been of no consequence they dont yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured at this moment a little boy half peasant half footboy came to announce supper	181.3506
it appears the conquerors had something else to do well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man porthos nodded in sign of agreement	142.3404
others proposed the _anguille_ another kind of recreation in which a handkerchief is filled with sand pebbles and twosous pieces when they have them which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer	155.0435
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shoppeople and the bands of mendicants reappeared	218.0466
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility to youno to you alone listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god what do you say	169.1877

the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	188.5888

madame de lannoy whom according to your majestys command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day thats it cried the king to him no doubt	115.4519
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbageleaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate	185.5738
no matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him	30.5197
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling	181.1535
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips	61.6038
you asked the name of that young lady	58.2335
which i received this morning dartagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it	70.0112
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you you have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old man	59.8690

the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river	63.4890
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man	14.2342
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly	92.7835
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil to my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions	58.9680
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the kings closet opened and m	38.5869
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller	141.3459
dépinay can have displeased your father more than any other person i believe i know m	84.3942

morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste	114.2811

noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m	74.4530
the host desired himself to serve him which dartagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation	221.9836
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champsélysées	179.4524
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him	48.7552
a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine oclock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it	75.6869
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber	79.7292
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man	61.4918
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded	154.4939
return to paris said he assemble the servants who remain there	79.9546
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	119.9573
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ah nonsense cried dartagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method what i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted and then asked mazarin turning pale	84.6628
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion	115.3706
i was most anxious to see you but it must have vexed m	43.6665
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title	74.9922
what the devil could that handkerchief signify placed where he was dartagnan could not perceive the face of aramis	164.5139
no the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst ii have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and	207.6532
whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinals lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable	165.4029
i have promised you the truth i will tell it were it to destroy me the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried felton	87.5554
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses worth francs to madame danglars his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villeforts life now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club	202.2001

do you know modern greek asked he	77.9416
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that dartagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos	115.0641
richelieu slowly tore the paper which dartagnan had generously relinquished	272.1579
why diamondsand she is covered with them to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame danglars	246.9850
my very self dear friend me also repeated porthos	322.8483
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag	197.2673
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to falluntil at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor	240.8526
and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer	1133.6079
he didnt predict the future he knew the pastoften a more dangerous thing mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place	201.7472

monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	53.6890
and nothing more	190.4263
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles	65.2270
but he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until	65.5109
the queens carriage had left the court	69.0511
escape had never once occurred to him	99.9679

albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him	200.2421
ah heavens if it were that but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort why not becausei scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it is it so	126.5296
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardonable albert rose	124.4838
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived	92.1376

they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his sons warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the distance	529.4573
madame danglars trembled with fear villefort started with joy	77.8999
monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here so there is no chance of my escaping you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently	96.1492

this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him	115.5977

de saintméran before you bought it it appears so replied monte cristo	62.2326
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation	328.5078
but return to your question m does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m	180.8098
this was in fact a custom familiar to him	95.6934
aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard	2571.1560
mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him	77.9179

and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers	271.4136

do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the	69.2966

lowborn fellows ejaculated porthos	419.1519
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief	142.3421

here and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again with what with this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantès a long sharp fishbone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still	210.3522

his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency	264.3686
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wifes having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt	176.5422

there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swordsthey saw the light of day i presume that is the night my lord i answered	104.2970
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue	130.6428
put an end to my doubts i have courage enough for any danger i can foresee for every misfortune which i understand	117.7098
franz de quesnel baron dépinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect	104.8691
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials	318.5180
well said porthos	12.8006
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	126.2090
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	146.0973
why did you talk of a regiment athos	70.6333
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead m	89.1442
the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around	143.7048
one doesnt hit the bullseye every time it is something to hit inside the ring	367.7725
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me	77.1211
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	73.2568
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man	36.5831
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead	39.7157
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward dartagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which dartagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that dartagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight	108.7503
june and july were the terrible months with athos	686.7603
mazarin took the letter and read it thus mr mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris	79.0422
see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count	57.4247
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee	84.8969
but come i am waiting for you both men entered monte cristos carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no	87.6343
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos my plan yes have you a plan no i am hungry that is all pardieu if that is all i am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat	115.1717
unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips	125.7408
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	35.0301
everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend	68.0082
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two	79.4448
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	80.5412
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head	175.9963
therefore let us separate	40.4521
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving englandin case either of failure or of success	261.5092
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	30.4574
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over	95.6411
shall i give you the change my officer said the host	42.5725
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open and the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk what monk the monk that was shut in with me no he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window	72.9047
come come said the young man a glass of wine father will revive you	53.2106
the king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number	90.7736
the ball struck the animal full in front	263.2560
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majestys letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and	74.2528
seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly	123.6476
i know because it is my office to know everything	69.1409
do you hearnot a single creature obey that person implicitly	576.1671
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared	72.9986
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same	121.3489
direction as the outer gallery does it not m it does and is not above fifteen feet from it about that well then i will tell you what we must do	101.6337
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge	102.2345
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait ah a monthsix monthsa year it is too long a time	97.7821
my place of abode is no avenue des champsélysées but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home	189.3945
he then gave himself up to his happiness	76.2264
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomylooking room separated by a wall from the vault itself	457.3961
how did these letters come said he	105.2146
why then doesnt he attend to it himself as at chantilly ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges	173.0234
i have only the letters of ali tepelini which i have placed before you the ring a token of his goodwill which is here and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly	133.1970
and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your fathers cause had been gained	96.7844
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody elses	252.0565
dartagnan dismissed planchet and requested his visitor to be seated	144.0865
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter	28.9924
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	117.9775
what was i saying	119.3436
for instance there is apoplexythat lightningstroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end	209.4188
but dress me as well as you are able only make haste think my dear girl its life and death kitty was but too well aware of that	188.7520
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended	336.5071
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances	289.5857
one of the last as you see if you hear anything of monsieur voiture be so kind as to send me word tomorrow oh said scarron he may die now why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes	84.0157
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality comminges smiled mazarin read and construed	262.7915
that smile	4706.2378
m	nan
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute	98.2526
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters	251.7742
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart	165.8954
what more need be said	2009.5135
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was	51.8457
coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things	199.0087
dartagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	123.6484
speak madame resumed mme	365.9242
alas my friends replied m	69.6074
i will pay twentyfive piastres for my passage back to leghorn	214.7449
mon dieu said the woman crossing herself	84.2278
oh i repeat it edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is sublime do you say so now mercédèsthen what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you	104.6951
the king threw himself into an armchair	37.8201
you see said lord de winter presenting dartagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman	68.8308
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire	165.9767
debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband	96.7148
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	207.8167
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame he asked coldly	148.7671
there is a proposition almost like it in the _augustinus_ of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner	163.5642
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed	153.3007
you never come to me without conferring pleasure	241.3518
dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort	35.4094
the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected	88.6016
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	51.7960
the name is not unknown to me the marquis of saintméran and he appeared to meditate	63.9434
you must be satan cried she	102.4814
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and davrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child davrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long	81.1236
deep groan of despair and anguish	113.5447
i do not see what you have in your hand said selim	35.7339
he therefore looked forward to six oclock with as much impatience as the duke himself	88.3849
is that your opinion dherblay yes said aramis we have promised then continued athos we have another reason it is thislisten in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry	107.0483
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense	162.8879
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either m alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life	179.1984
the will chapter	4245.7954
you know the history of the saraband _pardieu_ know it replied dartagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on	52.7214
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child	154.9168
they arrived at the appointed spot	57.3089
why i meant to pass it over to you my dear athos me why to me why you killed him they are the spoils of victory i the heir of an enemy said athos for whom then do you take me it is the custom in war said dartagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel even on the field	87.5238
of battle i have never done that porthos shrugged his shoulders aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos	110.2337
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone	50.8216
from a distance they perceived aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like sister anne at the dust in the horizon	148.6411
the tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage	117.5882
yesterday morning madame coming as usual i presume from the extreme end of the globe	155.7291
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place	80.2902
he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions	68.8395
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber	69.9467
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts	157.7883
de morcerf into the drawingroom said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase	102.1136
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	48.0244
or the mysterious benefactress said athos	261.3217
paris ii detest i loathe it very fine anne	802.0385
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france	209.9422
faria has dreamed this the cardinal spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the	262.6941
gloomy aperture that was open at his feet	172.9119
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night	43.4333
you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not	86.5405
willing to call anybody else count upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered but but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs	251.5711
you shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or i will throw it into the seine and i doubt as was the case with polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us well i will take it then said dartagnan	104.1711
the two brigands looked at each other for a momentthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow	57.6308
see my father see villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father	74.3470
come forward chapter lxxxv	872.5217
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this	52.6275
m	nan
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house	153.2851
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him	49.0926
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony	187.0051
i am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against king charles	89.7209
there are your instructions said mazarin go go tis easy to say so but that requires money and i havent any ah replied mazarin so you have no money none my lord but the diamond i gave you yesterday i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence mazarin sighed	97.8632
you are surprised at what you see here extremely but above all things i am a marvel to you i confess it i am still young am i not	116.0190
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last	69.1856
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone	119.0219
no no answered dantès dont imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner	82.2718
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance dartagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london	75.5621
do you know monsieur dartagnan lieutenant in the kings musketeers said the voice you are monsieur dartagnan i am then you came here to defend him him	43.3103
m	nan
there was a great press of people in m	78.9230
but the dead cannot return their fire certainly not they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls	112.1402
you look like four conspirators oh as to that monseigneur it is true said athos we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning	143.3591
i am replied the latter gravely	69.7492
order it as you please sire you possess the right of pardon the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is innocent	135.1467
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentryboxes	163.2374
what cried porthos are we all going away then	96.9651
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter	50.0475
the gascon and the italian	90.0426
i bought some spanish shares	476.3001
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground	81.0852
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession	91.0130
i will goi will go dartagnan took the soldiers arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword	125.6854
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in	144.1644
the russian ambassadors box which box do you mean asked the countess	203.4860
or at least i will golater he drew kitty to him	95.2159
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of dartagnan and athos	183.6263
you are not judges you cannot condemn me i offered you tyburn said lord de winter	87.4931
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edwards room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor	133.5002
how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation	93.9686
besides be assured my dear edmond the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation	173.7242
zounds lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed felton blushed	179.1609
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker	209.9926
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni	92.8160
unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut upcaptured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered	174.4920
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay	150.3383
the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island	126.0329
you know how little i require said the old man	48.6005
edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friendif indeed he had any friend leftcould recognize him he could not recognize himself	83.7107
as to dartagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate	113.6986
yes said he	6.7947
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded francs	452.1402
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister	51.3715
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet	141.3607
de montbazon and mme	270.1681
a man the discussion is going to begin again said mme	111.8213
mordaunt went away with the captain	43.8950
i am sure he will look like the great mogul they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses	87.3128
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	266.1584
it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes	223.9008
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my	101.4745
existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france m valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	94.8570
for stealing for stealing you rochefort you are laughing at me i understand	234.2940
de morcerf sets you the example albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots	252.8601
no mother from this moment i have done with the past and accept nothing from itnot even a name because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another albert my child said mercédès if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you your conscience	99.0532
has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its dictates	468.1704
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another	138.5202
the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which morcerf had formed no previous idea	260.1324
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded	107.4506
the lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in advance	102.9185
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	202.9350
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone illconcealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing	132.9438
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wifes writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my sons sake i became criminal	120.4495
your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army and if there is a truce the english army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it there	73.3854
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak	60.4357
the lieutenants entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawingroom but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water	121.8197
officer chapter lii	120.2012
you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject	93.4833
when they arrived at the madeleine since we are out said beauchamp let us call on m	60.9001
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity	92.0374
de tréville it had disappeared	37.8083
the horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon	100.6175
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret	173.1307
in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones	141.1175
in the month of july	35.9773
ah you fear your prisoner should escape said she	251.2735
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis	90.8281
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at liberty	65.1646
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol	74.1501
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety	415.4300
luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time	280.4071
de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life	84.8521
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face	124.6884
he determined to make two cardinals by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich men_this_ was the return the holy father looked for	237.7087
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same	136.2094
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here this voice the sound of which reached dartagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten	108.4682
whereupon grimaud observing the dukes disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him	96.0976
that is my condemnation thought dartagnan he will spare me the _ennui_ of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial	124.0445
those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm	77.2020
everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood	84.2801
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	114.9697
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of bordeaux	235.4420
no i make you my lieutenantgeneral said the king	49.0843
dartagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch	160.8374
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him	92.9954
rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at franz	278.9339
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here ah this is too much cried buckingham making a step toward the door	62.7397
look at the arms the sergeant put the lantern near the panel	112.4218
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration	77.4204
now said gondy there is a communion between us	55.7367
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	141.9997
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned	77.4997
most undoubtedly said planchet	234.3369
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	799.0496
albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up	120.7887
oh cried mme	105.4628
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature	209.9857
not i unfortunately said porthos	248.1760
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for fourandtwenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some	112.5220
information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf	106.8770
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay on hearing those	49.0461
two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard	35.6019
come sir said comminges make haste you must obey the king sir said broussel i am in bad health and cannot give myself up a prisoner in this state i must have time it is impossible said comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant impossible said louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair impossible cried a	168.0476
shrill voice from the end of the room	20.8359
they rode on in this way for ten minutes	54.8221
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement	378.9449
to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash	180.1335
very pretty but to the great astonishment of dartagnan the shutter remained closed	159.1906
the letter is here and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom	40.9104
stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for me having thus spoken dartagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	178.9725
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings	2043.9767
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too malcontent i go away enchanted farewell then or rather _au revoir_ for i hope we shall meet again whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminences orders that will be frequently i assure you for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation oh monseigneur	124.8844
_au revoir_ monsieur bonacieux _au revoir_ and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground	69.6792
before questioning me he said reply to my question	166.1380
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop	100.9763
dartagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver	89.9125
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheekbones of grimaud were favorable signs	230.2817
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor these were the beggars of the court of miraclesthe agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache preparing barricades for the morrow	233.3900
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw dartagnan who stood expecting her	112.7693
and you think that your wife has returned to the louvre without speaking to anyone but yourself i am sure of it that is an important point do you understand then the news i brought you is of value the greatest my dear bonacieux i dont conceal this from you then the cardinal will be pleased with me i have no doubt of	64.1453
it the great cardinal are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names i think not she did not name madame de chevreuse the duke of buckingham or madame de vernet no she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious personage the traitor murmured mme	113.6964
you heard m	570.3693
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir	41.1019
no my child no said madame de saintméran but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father my father inquired valentine uneasily	57.9936
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playingcards fixed against the wall	120.4491
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent	90.5561
for us also inquired athos	218.6667
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied dartagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed	78.2196
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangementsomething in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject	169.9711
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right dartagnan mouston will do mouston has a very fine appearance dartagnan smiled	96.5506
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too	69.4797
but i doubt that your object was like theirsto rescue the holy sepulchre you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat	282.7111
m rise said he	129.7316
de nargonne had married m	220.0571
stay here is another louis for you then that will make only louis more said peppino with the same indifference	176.9247
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m	78.5056
think for a moment	40.6999
i am determined to tell them all about it be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety	121.5621
pardon me monsieur said dartagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back m	40.5512
goodbye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man	30.9279
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections	193.4780
men of the robe and men of the sword chapter xvi	86.3692
bonacieux that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion and not in the pavilion that she might have been detained in paris by her duties or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband	39.8478
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew	220.5246
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly	353.8325
oh we can scarcely say	128.6321
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message	70.9491
stop yes doubtless replied dartagnan who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is one there certainly is one said m	113.7654
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him	81.8369
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat	436.1619
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever	371.5782
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer	37.9168
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness	258.6964
ask baron franz dépinay i think he tasted them one day yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you always would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage	192.2650
what is this rent said he showing dartagnan a place where it had been pierced through	112.9068
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys	150.4752
we are not generally very severe with the austrians	127.7269
mazarin sent us to cromwell	119.2859
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	75.4825
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself	93.7721
just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin	469.2698
do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like glass that will not prevent me replied dartagnan if ever i find him in the meantime said tréville seek him notif i have a right to advise you all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion	145.3154
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles	290.1611
de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	180.3767
it is thisi swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the th of february between nine and ten oclock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his	164.2214
manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did	206.5169
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess of the arabian nights if you like but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess	122.2562
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it	128.9025
why should i risk an imprudent step	307.2327
let us start then we need no witnesses very true said monte cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see	45.2132
the joy of the king was lively	141.2724
guard the prisoners well i beg of you the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and dartagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	70.0347
he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor	126.4668
at length the longdesired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him	66.5940
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	207.5819
in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time oh i also swear it monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart	77.3388
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father	193.2649
de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters gladly said albert let us calli love him chapter	250.5136
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning	75.3514
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet	318.2734
with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way by all means replied monte cristo i follow you chapter	72.0088
i do sometimes soldier though i am monte cristo advanced into the room maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him	85.9431
he drew back terrified	324.7260
i tell you that you know these things as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken	76.3299
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty	192.0799
explain yourself then noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentines hand	147.4230
yield he cried or you are a dead man the musket fell from the soldiers hands who yielded on the instant	132.9462
according to the laws of dueling at that period dartagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased	63.8368
de saintméran lived at marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the baroness one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows	102.7752
and i guessed that she was awaiting m	100.8553
you will find good cigars on the centre table	123.9471
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernands look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows	179.3406
then three or four shots were fired	92.1969
i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests	197.4987
in fact m	93.1624
old dantès was dead and mercédès had disappeared	56.3141
pyramus and thisbe about twothirds of the way along the faubourg sainthonoré and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large garden where the widespreading chestnuttrees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart and	147.3256
with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate that dated from the time of louis xiii	189.5318
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your kneeson your kneeshe is our benefactorthe saviour of our father he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him	121.4451
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key	60.3550
bravo cried dartagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis	198.0437
do you hear ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows as you will valentine shall you be happy if i do what you wish oh	135.4386
yes valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening	128.1438
she had heard something said about supper	286.3512
and now said dartagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos	47.1347
yes i have replied franz i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered cæsars _commentaries_ said the bandit it is my favorite work well are you coming asked albert	109.2341
dartagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friends house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni	80.0172
you cannot imagine mother how beautiful i think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love	75.5981
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty	135.7306
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience	72.9302
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token	118.1334
they stamped upon the carpet with their feet they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might	120.7465
alas do you love nothing else in me asked dartagnan	63.0503
the absolution	10684.8662
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	262.4749
and you shall be alone replied the young man	16.1694
grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety	80.5889
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it	55.8735
fine vengeance that on my faith a cold sweat broke from dartagnans brow	249.8219
this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed	70.8808
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely dartagnan his captaincy porthos his barony	193.6435
do you still wish to do so i have no wishes count only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your word with me do i not ah count i shall forget it no you will not forget it because you are a man of	86.8800
honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again oh count have pity upon me	112.4362
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross	129.2710
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen	87.1314
after a moments interval cocles appeared	190.3360
we must see what it is said grimaud	31.3799
baptistin	nan
why the devil a horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy dartagnan did not smile	269.2353
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bankbills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	289.8954
this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat	165.6171
morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve	53.4848
here it is said he	22.6268
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative	171.9312
at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old wormeaten table was a tall young man of twenty or twoandtwenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled	101.9792
the famous secretaire is in the dressingroom is there a window in the dressingroom twoone here and one there andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom	140.5477
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united but where is such a lackey to be found not to be found cried athos	203.6846
i was wrong then no i said what you saythere is a crisis at hand	151.0821
general said the president do not alarm yourself you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not	102.2926
replyclose the doors said the president to the doorkeeper	57.7355
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair _incognita_ belonged to the aristocracy	225.8280
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m	24.1584
now since dartagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way	70.9937
in a moment you didnt forget my purse no be easy good porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post	126.7128
go leave me i would be alone	70.9563
pardon me for having joined with your persecutors milady held out her hand to him	76.6150
dartagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right	47.8770
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed	100.9219
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting	112.5354
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god	131.6863
we will talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventuresyou shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess	90.9458
here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for i now recollect you	124.2546
that reply led to several questions about the kings capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely	460.5472
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice you are a born diplomat returned franz go and try meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire	224.4848
bertuccio no excellency i do not recollect telling you that i thought you did i must have been mistaken no you were not for it was in reality a little boy	50.7283
you are now master of england i was much more really so two hours ago how so general because england had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken	166.8919
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugénie became uneasy	90.2459
this moment was frightful if i had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality	220.5663
the clock struck halfpast eight and still another halfhour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening	179.9845
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not armed to the teeth replied mazarin	198.6656
do not my mother and you agree asked albert astonished	109.4411
beauchamp if you assure me that m	51.5416
dépinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m	55.4303
you mean that this demands explanation do you not i admit it well this is what actually took place one evening after an orgy in reinards apartment at the tuileries with the duc dharcourt fontrailles de rieux and others the duc dharcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the pont neuf that is you know a diversion which the duc	177.4988
dorleans made quite the fashion were you crazy rochefort	662.9957
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth	244.3426
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him	131.8534
to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count	269.6597
you are silent	121.4406
winter give the necessary orders winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet	265.7473
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchengarden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at	331.0180
some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some marketgardeners at a yearly rental of francs	194.7105
what said kitty blushing	706.3670
this door was a mockery to the _concierge_ from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_ opening at the _sesame_ of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world	255.6721
bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness	126.0736
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart i have been heavens substitute to recompense the goodnow the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea	228.2922
albert rose to return to his place	39.0205
but whats that to us	252.8762
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire oh that goes for nothing said gaetano	137.0999
where is the child villefort shrugged his shoulders	53.8792
take pity on me then and go oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself i should run mad	62.0201
even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass	150.1731
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes	91.4691
the beggar of st eustache	86.5668
de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a _cabal_ when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about	137.0968
her the queens emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the kinglouis xiii	241.1932
since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully	143.7371
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so	27.4559
dartagnan in his fortieth year	517.0913
four other noblemen awaited me	542.2571
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain golden dreams cried aramis	210.5461
it is the counts reply poor kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter contained	190.3049

edmond hoped he was dying	203.4129
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations	160.3150

porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned dartagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	125.2257
my heart is that of a musketeer i feel it monsieur and that impels me on withdraw young man cried jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed dartagnans design	151.7370
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively	93.3160
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely	144.1618
you will appear at this ball yes with those studs yes the queens paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character	155.9422
he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds and resided on his new estate	124.5496

ho your honor cried mousqueton the man you upset is getting up why didnt thou do as thou didst to the first man said porthos	204.4260
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman	130.4333
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point	225.3703
and will you sign the contract i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me	77.7367
it seemed like the _fête_ of jackolanterns	218.2596
at the moment of arriving at st paulthe spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executedhe was near fainting and crossed himself twice	155.5195
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	148.1403
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe	71.7276
has not some sage said nothing too much	141.4018
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality	261.9752
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	134.9496
save the queen cried mazarin to the coadjutor	39.7852

adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away	85.0714
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up true monsieur le comte replied dartagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	168.7054
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse	631.0784
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted	35.6096
dartagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it	132.8907

no news had been received of them only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for aramis	273.1165
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence ah really said monte cristo in a halfstifled voice	147.8742

chapter lxxvii	1454.2654
i shall use it again upon occasion and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day dartagnan directed his course toward m	212.4258
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent	171.0399
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper	210.8776
ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice	37.0136
zounds exclaimed porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat	296.8640
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded	79.3681
ah your pardon said albert turning round will you allow me captain and he lighted his cigar at vampas torch	140.7378
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them	170.0158
do you intend to sit up for me no but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open particularly in the night	108.6187
peppino chapter	343.0034
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror	170.7615
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the kings attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olivegreen door asked if the abbé busoni were within	80.4084
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart	57.2814
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villeforts we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts	80.9546
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning	52.4580
when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rosecolored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized	79.4774

the young mans eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie	111.0593
he strictly followed the instructions he had received	207.0061
i embrace you	148.6009
now said dartagnan ive one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges at your service sir you will see the count again tomorrow morning will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained you want the cardinal to come here no i know my place and am not so	66.6827

tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp	97.4904
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos	452.0160
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of heramorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her	234.2473
to be a bishop aramis answered dartagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear	188.7886
his next care on leaving the barbers who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailors suita garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap	240.6641
tréville was one of these latter	58.2743
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis	128.0708
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other yes in favor of some member of your family no do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary	168.6886
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room	78.5248
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat but you can sleep when you please monsieur said morrel	93.6433
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	31.8928
then he saw beneath a thick clump of lindentrees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawingroom into the garden	115.8104
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	193.2472
luigi arrived first	1193.6096
so now i breathe againi am happy dont be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed dartagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering	301.0120
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	152.7641
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming	619.3124
fie pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher higher	126.6947
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself	256.4043
now guess what the young one did tell me he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body	88.6850
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds a boars ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster	448.5572
his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious	68.8072
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands	123.1327
there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move	87.0463
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion indiscretionoh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject	170.2248
the count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves tis true where can we find another sword asked porthos	123.6557

dartagnan related his story simply with the omission of names	337.9316
what a confounded country this england is this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal what do you think dartagnan asked athos	72.1977
monsieur baptistin especially i could never get such a man as that	150.9329
adieu we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness	121.7767
richelieu in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to rule that paper must be torn to pieces said dartagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of death	131.3160
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound	65.5738
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage	99.5949
de villefort made and returned very few visits	265.0222
mouston appeared with a most piteous face	152.6935
mr jackson said he go instantly to the lord chancellor and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders	95.8411
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old mans forehead where valentines had been	55.3002

the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine	209.3665
then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old said albert	79.0978
villefort therefore gained nothing save the kings gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m	92.2719
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistressyour mistress above all dartagnan blushed	305.9738
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saintremy	92.5434
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream	259.1119
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	84.1381
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort	53.5223
to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the goodnatured man and the indulgent father	141.0429
how much asked danglars	49.6416
the hostess as she entered saw dartagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon dartagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly	128.6566
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel m	301.9352
chapter lxxii	158.1245
was it not i	34.7046
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for dartagnan and an ace for himself	167.5500
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	51.5241
m an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel	331.9121
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them	162.4411
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray	172.1912

three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres	49.6822
dartagnan took his hand	11.2602
yes well as for me i prefer hannibal and why pray master la ramee asked the duke	120.8782
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	223.3054
oh to be sure yes	90.2593
monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it	72.5090
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway	120.6966
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	207.1046
midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl	113.0328

fernand dashed his on the ground	88.8568
ever since valentines dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad	162.6752
thats it said the tutor	38.4241
the other room near the library was a bedroom	207.3287
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice my advice is this said monsieur darminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat	93.1188
what then have i to fear from him you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life	117.8724
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de larbresec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if	140.4552
he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	772.3000
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling	147.2725
danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker	123.2494
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful deadleaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada	125.5148
he was quite prepared for any such encounter	176.2640
besides i am here in my own country and that excites me and both with free use of the spur arrived at st omer without drawing bit	151.0581
_pardieu_ cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa	84.0799
by her step she must be young perhaps she is pretty	122.9791

general dépinay died five minutes after franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud but after a moments silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow	101.4911
marked his course	161.6992
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majestys windowthe cry we heard was hisand there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol but the comte de la fere asked the king	316.4372
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death and ii swear to you before god madame said dartagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone	84.1173
then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine	85.5613
ordinarily m	2668.0139
de trévilles private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl	189.2902
now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso and as i now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine thats my point for sport	242.9069
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body	242.5381

yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye not on your own account surely replied monte cristo for a man is above that sort of thing oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head	66.5285
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast	61.1225
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself	60.4150
release broussel she cried never at this moment steps were heard in the anteroom and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door	61.1048
at the same time continued dartagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey yes indeed said porthos	60.5082
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant true said m	91.4745
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse	213.3885
and they pursued their road in mournful silence	272.1043
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word	39.6451
as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	51.0065
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison	131.1271
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes	133.6131
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of dartagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends	61.7699
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant	348.0642
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes	62.3781
say to her peace or war my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	151.6780
must i take anything with me money if you have any yes fortunately they have left me all i had so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel here said milady placing a bag full of louis in feltons hands	111.9533
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i dont like to humiliate people then your duchess is still at the waters asked dartagnan	298.1700
you were too young to know about such things i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about it and who told you about it asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience	48.2950
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal	158.5477
you are only betrayed the king sighed deeply	170.0047
my dear dartagnan said aramis dont be too angry with me i beg	35.9841
hurry hurry said andrea we must overtake him soon and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres	273.5958
at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible	201.0876
well cried he throwing his sword upon the bed this man must be the devil in person he has disappeared like a phantom like a shade like a specter do you believe in apparitions asked athos of porthos	80.7198
he held some papers in his hand his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin	108.8494
bazin	nan
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage	189.4636
like women not like queens egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these and m	237.8368
for tell me where can you find a love like minea love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word	457.0024
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself	105.1849
here i am albert said	45.1987
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us	112.3719
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent death planchet said dartagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care	110.8014
dartagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started	37.1289
you are the best companion that i know dartagnan he said offering his hand to the gascon and i am very happy in having found you again my dear son this was as we have seen the term which athos applied to dartagnan in his more expansive moods	85.7464
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	53.3268
why do you sing thus and with such a voice said he	61.7603
yes and her husband found out that she had a _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder cried porthos	105.2788
chapter x	156.3419
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes	230.8540
he touched him on the shoulder	45.4421
thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugénie perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions monte cristo smiled	221.0637
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name	122.0285
its tiresome work to keep awake a whole night yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream	325.2686
a bed of dried grass covered with goatskins was placed in one corner	146.0492
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade	139.2153
did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said	43.5027
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him	122.3242
to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability	197.7078
recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica	138.6057
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé	45.1273
didnt you see that monsieur dartagnan mounted with difficulty	74.4300
caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court	142.8488
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son	125.5285
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column	97.0880
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty here it is replied aramis	178.8949
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark	107.0446
m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	43.6612
but that is all	19.5848
dantès continued his search	191.9381
will our help come from you yes you are sure of it yes there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power	179.3260
but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber but tell me said beauchamp what is life	90.3221
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man	112.0092
zaccones youth the fathers no the sons i know nothing certain at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade was he in the wars i think he entered the service in what branch in the navy are you not his confessor no sir i believe he is a lutheran a lutheran i say i believe such is the	150.7796
case i do not affirm it besides liberty of conscience is established in france doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the name of the prefect of police i ask you what you know of him	100.5456
do you wish me to lend you some m what a bad calculator you are exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation	131.1499
because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them	320.1906
whats the manner cried athos	106.1786
_peste_ returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellowhe took his watch from his waistcoat pocketand it cost me francs let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself	174.5614
sir began raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil	123.1346
besides what is required of a young man in paris	53.5862
aramis after a journey into lorraine disappeared all at once and ceased to write to his friends they learned at a later period through mme	233.9240
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits	89.5459
miladys secret chapter xxxviii	131.5018
i was present during his last moments	153.3970
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had leftmy saving knife but i could not reach the bolster	189.0725
poor dear monsieur dartagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans hand	53.9165
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me if my society would not be disagreeable be it so	135.1959
when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door	79.1750
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said dartagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos	95.2368
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles	135.6931
but do you know where no in the kings room the kings room cried athos	43.9820
beauchamp pulled out his watch	90.3076
trial it was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till midnight	257.1238
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine	136.3329
the swiss became as purple as a peony	250.4087
i ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt humph said porthos	156.3934
ah ah gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings	129.6551
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge in two words dartagnan informed him where mme	86.2053
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived	223.8715
noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to dieit is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward	166.3584
porthos did the same	74.2283
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them	135.9286
grimaud my good grimaud exclaimed raoul here you are at last excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend	91.6495
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation	593.6105
milady was wrong in fearing that mme	122.7210
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart	44.1017
hem replied dartagnan	30.6303
how many people thought he and not one true friend and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart	183.4498
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle	212.2176
are you still resolved to accompany me more determined than ever well then come along franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino	112.7083
the english who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp	471.9892
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion	127.7536
did you pass through the corso yes well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross	62.3028
bazin became a lay brother	1877.2753
athos was right	85.5163
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm	376.4098
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	125.6379
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected	142.3477
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber	136.4017
no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible	48.1025
to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	223.4511
perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled and five minutes after i left without having heard one word that had passed poor maximilian murmured valentine	136.3107
arrest them ah my young man said dartagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed	146.5440
which means that i have just been dupedsixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour dartagnan and athos laughed aloud	115.4974
gradually the receptionroom filled and some of our old friends made their appearancewe mean debray châteaurenaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m	232.2451
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father	248.0689
i have answered for you	36.5564
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin	618.3334
are they made to order precisely said the count six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness	250.7069
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent	194.4399
the concert must be a delightful one they suit each other remarkably well said danglars	231.5354
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him	44.6892
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travellingcarriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no and stopped in the yard	90.9495
a few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate	34.7601
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception	119.5257
he must now get his bearings	447.7733
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty	44.6297
i cannot stop a moment i must start for paris again immediately what	119.2142
what are you doing asked milady with surprise	18.7467
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme	43.6372
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible	987.6681
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux	178.1232
chapter xxxiv	63.5875
it was her first and on what an occasion each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy	143.0278
yes and now i shall be more calm you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling	38.1848
whatever you say sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such thingsno the commission i ask is quite different name it sir i beg you are the inspector of prisons i have been so these fourteen years you keep the registers of entries and departures i do to these registers there are added notes relative to	126.8981
the prisoners there are special reports on every prisoner well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly	224.7460
the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world	135.3361
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic firtrees and myrtles	169.8079
do you not comprehend no the château dif has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirtysixpound cannonball to their feet well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension	167.7415
chapter	nan
a waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	219.3071
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saintméran oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am	108.8601
sure	nan
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles	219.0538
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure	64.2463
is that what you wish for said barrois	88.8939
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe	41.2214
if you have two coats you will give me one of them	32.5058
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer	34.3104
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune	61.1171
the fourth horse had arrived	166.6575
cheer up said she to noirtier	56.7663
i thought as much said dartagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts	214.3811
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word	61.6127
milady was there as it were where you sit athos changed color ii was where dartagnan stands	827.0172
are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a year mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her cheeks	76.7186
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count	105.0514
his devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile	193.9194
i give you the rest of tonight and all day tomorrow	67.3938
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf	59.5565
he passed on to anotherit also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full	267.1596
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear	102.3085
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back	198.8100
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully	82.0758
you have the window that is sufficient	79.6915
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize youyour fathers name so well known in italy and so highly honored	214.7199
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner	244.9219
valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you valentine started	68.0923
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte	51.9676
morrel i believe said villefort	105.0625
you will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine	77.4137
chapter xxxviii	59.9021
and who is the assassin they asked together	205.4953
now said the count what will you takea glass of sherry port or alicante alicante if you please it is my favorite wine i have some that is very good	88.8643
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss	307.4631
and youwhat are you doing here replied dartagnan	42.1081
in a couple of hours he returned	96.9979
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression	162.3358
dantès instantly turned to meet him	69.5191
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise	496.8775
i have not your confidence i fear the cardinal hush said mme	108.1490
two soldiers were accordingly sent for and the inspector descended a stairway so foul so humid so dark as to be loathsome to sight smell and respiration	338.4519
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you	111.8005
are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brotherinlaw but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you	157.4888
it is the truth however	54.5661
by the orders of the deputy procureur i believe so the conviction that they came from m	88.5893
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression	182.9953
well _pardieu_ said aramis it was only this i had a dream and i related it to her yez yez said the swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but i neffer dream you are very fortunate said athos rising i wish i could say as much neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything	147.9865
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort	9.9613
by the governors orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath to the dungeon then said the corporal	215.7815
the next day m	33.6101
hold out your hand and swear cried athos and aramis at once	49.7456
were you present during the last struggle asked m	124.7012
himself my lord but he is said to be a furious mazarinist phew whistled planchet	176.7323
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk	279.5484
is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement	123.6512
do you say that m	11.5165
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saintmérans morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear	213.5773
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	150.7668
yes before witnesses oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it there has been a crime said monte cristo	99.9824
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues	387.6715
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance	385.1667
danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifes favorite sittingroom where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then	186.1472
he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness	222.9693
the abbé sank upon edmonds bed while edmond himself remained standing	326.7596
in recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man	99.2372
i implored heaven that he might come	324.8647
the countess had this portrait painted during the counts absence	308.4272
he is gone gone never to return oh madame do not think that i tell you he will never return	82.7122
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished	674.7047
there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange	172.7469
all the visions of the soul	52.0911
ah _pardieu_ continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange	72.3414
a worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a position	111.7164
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses	111.0985
have you really no desire to meet him none whatever replied eugénie	113.5359
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed	103.0775
thou must add said dartagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servantman with white hair	105.5704
and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself	679.4380
at the same time monte cristos voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champsélysées	108.5894
de villefort kings attorney yes and if you wish to know his name i will tell ithe is named villefort the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience	115.8439
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together till tomorrow then said aramis for ironnerved as you are you must need repose the next morning when dartagnan entered aramiss chamber he found him at the window	73.5633
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him	46.0374

the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him	510.9876
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight of the order of st michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship	126.5428
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme	78.4015
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till	132.8235
she believed them truths	1511.5521
chapter	nan
i shrink before nothing but impossibilities nothing is impossible replied milady to true love nothing madame nothing replied milady	356.9215
milady smiled with joy	23.3998
bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead i shall go mad stop what i hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off again	154.2260
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window	71.5951
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass	46.2225
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul	113.8533
of the important cities given up by henry iv	232.6512
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m	65.2862
i bought my experience dearlyparticularly fair women	2716.8928
different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect	139.8378
come who is my father i came to tell you ah cried benedetto his eyes sparkling with joy	72.3542
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake	77.6398
my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor believe me i am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you is that true and do you speak seriously asked louvieres	70.5906
mordaunt replied grimaud	169.6566
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish ithe will do everything wrong undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish	97.7360
this idea completely restored clemency to his heart	427.8438
must i always be the same said he and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven	139.4197
milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength	36.1286
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge	98.7507
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws	134.0530
all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse	100.2919
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game	99.1720
madame said athos when must we set out you consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully	118.6482
the commission is usually one and a half will you have twothreefive per cent or even more	209.3696
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause	164.4987
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	311.2292
mousqueton exclaimed dartagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys carriage it is he cried porthos	64.9484
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words_wait and hope_your friend edmond dantès _count of monte cristo_ m during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness	196.7448
of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks her happiness cost her very dear	110.3434
while he was doing this dartagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared	165.9154
the result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege	158.8206
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès	226.3292
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer	174.5524
i was still unable to divine for what reason m	124.2203
i believe so i dont know its of no consequence	127.2197
_dentro la testa_ replied the same voice with the same menacing accent	94.3180
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	111.3065
they fire like grooms said porthos	477.1530
dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body	180.1950
you know her it seems said châteaurenaud	90.5679
de tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was passing	29.9558
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	130.0605
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	227.5690
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds	78.7481
but what is the matter albert	26.6531
there is to be war in flanders	82.1468
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table	78.2807
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais dartagnans horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose	90.5348
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saintantoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porters absence	113.8139
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace good very good said porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron at this moment nine oclock struck	120.0675
the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid curiosity	80.1007
it is almost dinnertime and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my toodevoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which i am in a fair way never to get done	156.0764
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter	85.8126
of course you stopped at your fathers a feeling of faintness came over villefort	294.5497
do you know what they are saying here no your eminence well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he has not done so already the officers face expressed complete stupefaction	82.5244
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron	74.7632
be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses	85.3846
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart	44.6401
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted	100.7071
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect	176.4296
of life was scented with its masters favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish	302.3936
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	81.0270
morrel said châteaurenaud will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m	29.6489
danglars says you are rich and perfectly free	76.5094
what oclock is it the baron drew out his watch	127.0026
far from here asked athos	85.2502
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm	30.2411
lieutenant asked aramis	76.5639
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy you madame said dartagnan affecting surprise is that possible my godgood and beautiful as you are a mortal enemy indeed an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death	104.3308
it has arrived at the hôtel des princes rue de richelieu	50.4979
is monsieur your cousin	392.4676
they will be ten times worse off in a week ah yes good heavens i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen	133.9730
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was a beam	204.1997
that is very annoying said the brigadier for the man we are looking for is the chief cucumetto cried luigi and teresa at the same moment	87.2923
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not your mission is not accomplished exclaimed dartagnan looking in astonishment at athos	104.3963
those who are known are not the most dangerous i know it and appeal to your penetration	82.1451
revenge yourself then edmond cried the poor mother but let your vengeance fall on the culpritson him on me but not on my son it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation	146.9459
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting	145.9314
dantès is my friend and i wont have him illused and who thinks of using him ill	169.1542
the rain of blood chapter	145.2332
however in an hour i shall know all	41.7794
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert	59.8794
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte	85.2751
but contrary to all expectation when the st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	283.5530
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything	50.5436
capital exclaimed the gascon	32.3379
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents	183.3989
milady shuddered	352.7694
then he paused	58.8733
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he	53.0117
m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make	72.8699
excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	166.8040
i know it and now the ranks began to open	86.9713
chapter	nan
alone valentine has no power she will be compelled to submit	101.9468
mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven	63.4207
then gloom settled heavily upon him	958.6131
here said he is a proof of my satisfaction at this epoch the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not prevail	113.5336
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	79.1235
the workmen	24656.7363
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long squareheaded nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another	166.2614
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo	503.3879
i go tomorrow my friend replied dartagnan	78.3649
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends dear dartagnan oh how he will thank you i hope so	48.6129
dartagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers	173.9688
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed air	90.0970
ah ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh porthos murmured the comte de la fere	63.8409
morrel smiled and shook his head	21.6686
noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for youeh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly	93.2540
noirtier	nan
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight	114.3614
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence	218.1780
but the first was repugnant to him	84.2663
dartagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with	185.6635
the court party	1945.0850
are you all here he asked	24.3918
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell	96.0592
to saint peters first and then to the colosseum returned albert	154.5550
the interior of the musketeers when dartagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pommedepin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress	96.5184
tréville understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots	87.4059
by force	1925.2220
villefort walked to and fro behind them	131.1365
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise dartagnan had made and opening the door said come in all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that dartagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard	135.6733
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde whilst mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the palais royal	129.1985
chapter xiv	67.3567
his heart failed him	136.6577
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which i had to reply i called for help yes yes that is true	95.5920
well said franz anything newdo they refuse on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objectionthe more so as i bring my share of the supper oh it is not that he has plenty and to spare for	117.5096
supper but he makes one condition and rather a peculiar one before he will receive you at his house his house	150.5551
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur dartagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve	94.3022
absolute secrecy	1987.2010
if you be a priest i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man if you be not it is a different matter and i warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that i shall chastise you for your insolence the pale face of the monk became so livid and his	68.0002
smile so strange that raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult	70.8147
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obeybut too well	101.5988
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the eventi was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east	70.7613
noirtiers room	330.8594
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the barons equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle	60.3775
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother	127.7677
go into the grotto and dress yourself at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest	146.5393
of the costume	103.4052
theres only the price we are not agreed about how not agreed about said caderousse	233.5217
noirtiers reason answered morrel i can readily believe it to be a good one an excellent one said valentine	107.1230
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter	119.5537
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	207.1629
de villefort sire i fear it is more than a plot i fear it is a conspiracy a conspiracy in these times said louis xviii smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as reestablished so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the	118.4007
present and the future	61.3150

the insult chapter	511.1129
de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow	105.7319
the man placed his finger on her lips	43.1834
poor king culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes	265.7538
it was mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	143.8439
but after his bath asked morcerf	346.3404
come father added dantès put this money back in your boxunless neighbor caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service no my boy no said caderousse	175.3784
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others _pardieu_ i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before me	133.0706
such is the atrocious logic of revolutions	395.8498
the host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the door	87.1065
on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers	184.7189
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m	116.0043
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair	171.4079
i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared	80.8573
chapter xxx	154.2502
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	93.4637
felton darted into the palace	58.6873
a moments silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow	169.1585
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is threequarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentines sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest	110.4161
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	114.9900
it is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness comminges bowed and left	142.3853
yes said noirtier	79.1194
feverish and excited i rang at the door	83.1661
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	131.5405
the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage	56.5857
who art thou cried he clasping his hands	83.1844
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the _cicerone_ sprang into the seat behind	145.8801
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said morrel with a smile full of grief i am under his orders for the next month oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said julie	97.4284
and a little bit of a thief oh sir oh and more especially a notorious coward oh oh sir you really vilify me cried olivain	164.6731
the usurpers conversion murmured the duke looking at the king and dandré who spoke alternately like virgils shepherds	266.2957
what are his means of existence	225.4175
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur bonacieux	118.6287
his heart beat but not like dartagnans with a young and impatient love	441.6402
we are first said morrel looking out of the window	38.1152
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full	255.7222
mazarin breathed again	700.2490
a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating	137.9522
great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality	81.3479
to be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastardthat is he can be do not say that debray returned beauchamp laughing for here is châteaurenaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of renaud de montauban his ancestor through your body he will sully it then returned lucien for i am lowvery low oh	222.2945

too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood rascal eh monsieur said dartagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat do you hear well well rejoined the	159.9166
leader theres no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for	82.1017
you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp said albert with increased though stifled anger	256.2944
oh heavens you are then some secret implacable and mortal enemy i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles	137.3022
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard these announced the arrival of the queen	58.5763
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you albert was on the point of pronouncing his fathers name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	58.1867
eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage	47.4824
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear	69.8468
the noise of his footsteps	74.1970
dartagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment	42.7246
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot	195.0069
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph	251.9847
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection	304.1531
tis easily guessed	1548.8149
and you go in an hourtime to eat a morsel during which i shall send for a post horse capital adieu chevalier adieu countess commend me to the cardinal commend me to satan milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated	206.4350
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner	96.9244
louis xviii	4.2327
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand	86.2588
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity	141.4308
so he cherishes no resentment you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	124.1388
de bassompierre who was embroiled with the duc dangoulême	50.7977
and i who have answered for him to the queeni who have promised my poor mistressah my god my god she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever	111.5782

then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink	110.5397
i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent	102.6799
chapter xxxvi	57.6568
beauchamp replied florentin	4329.6973

well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am talking	51.6216
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and lowspirited thats all	280.6857
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his selfabasement	121.3582
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the eventthat is to say till two oclock in the afternoontwo vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admirals ship	175.0798
morrel farewell do you leave me yes i have business in italy	107.1568
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one	98.7415
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses danglars took advantage of caderousses temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saintvictor staggering as he went	108.8546
parliament can never have passed such an act as that at this moment the landlord came in	100.3390
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	420.0973
this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame	213.2047
perhaps said athos but at all events listen well to this	84.2599
by men of heart i mean men of courage	376.6956
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near	68.8390
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger	96.9824
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law	35.7195
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	346.6945
athos began to despair	89.3234
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly	501.8225
but what i know is that i promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going and you will leave me then yes without waiting for my coming out again yes word of honor by the faith of a gentleman	53.0424
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the floor was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury indeed everything offended eyes	289.9660
accustomed to refinement and elegance	176.5968
but continued dartagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window	90.2107
but we must not lose time	69.7043
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar	186.4270
give it me that i may see it is not false there it is the child put the piece of money into his pocket	52.7059
olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musketshots	107.9882
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a	97.1049
mistake that m	48.3508
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night that was the very evening when the abduction of mme	83.3816
are you not a christian he said falling on his knees	23.3137
stand aside he cried stand off the road what do you want asked a voice	93.1848
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles	76.0892
he came down into the kitchen where your doublet was	119.0240
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs you guess well i know something of diamonds i have had some you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	149.4601
in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a cloak	124.1056
listenyou know if i may be relied on yes said caderousse	86.6937
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	203.4966
m	nan
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that dartagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queens letter and for which he had repaid m	92.6767
it is no doubt the same said he	23.1533
two months said he	41.1893
your dartagnan	13404.2783
he did not look like an executioner and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	90.7284
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness	65.2799
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor	87.0448
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	63.1291
let me conduct your business and my own	69.3822
arrived there he fastened according to the orders of his master both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurators door then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed	114.4976
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven	114.4302
but the voyage was not ended	102.9965
he regrets the devil ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you dartagnan felt himself bewildered	161.6588
de monte cristo the count bowed	25.3220
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke	131.6828
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword	88.3046
come back sirs back the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were heard	98.4642
de tréville stopping him	77.1622
aramis if that is all it is easily done said porthos	53.4570
the effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy	140.8334
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them	58.7766
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey	112.3402
they have rarely been successful	257.4451
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction	25.7615
but this annoys you let us change the subject	123.3905
alas sir said he i cannot but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you i certainly am surprised replied m	108.7580
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty its true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in himhe is conceited and stupid porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew dartagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose	181.2340
i love my sister juliei love her husband emmanuel but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments	90.8935
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against dartagnanprojects lost in the distance of the future	215.8882
these are doubtless your family arms	394.3214
you shall soon see him	37.8162
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the disputea proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse	83.7561
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house	33.6552
ho ho said he good advice advice of a friend	103.9739
dartagnan frowned at him	161.8870
de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	85.8540
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess	62.4253
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it	248.9045
was bestowed	6906.9692
the first risk that dantès ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven oclock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dantès had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word	121.9458
without your aid continued he repeating the counts words i should have been a dead manthrice dead my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	111.9125
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twentyfive and thirty feet in length	133.6446
i am neither an angel nor a demon i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all yes yes said felton i doubted but now i believe you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter you believe and yet you leave me in the hands	62.5977
of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheriesto that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist i deliver you up to buckingham	187.1726
shall i call on him as i pass davrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman	107.7271
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit	127.8446
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars	116.6509
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute	159.3848
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands	33.3725
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison	79.1816
_on y va_ coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms	289.3915
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host	166.3149
a great man in every country m	125.1606
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them	75.2476
olivain said athos showing the servant raouls shoulderbelt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low	518.6133
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered	163.1888
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet dartagnan	67.9769
now said he im off to the bishops	113.2783
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château dif and the tower of planier	105.6231
latterly i heard his friend monsieur dartagnan give him that name that is it madame that is the same	89.0501
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare	247.2833
moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf	184.5943
they can move their arms they can and that is much	156.9919
but enough of thishere is my card take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street	157.7476
speak comte de la fere my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand	32.9673
de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post	64.4793
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout	195.0538
the chevalier murmured charles	1548.7240
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of italy	131.2538
de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	293.8274
but continued dartagnan you shall judge of him for yourself	67.5382
come hither monsieur dartagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air	188.6965
noirtier is desirous of making his will yes yes yes motioned the invalid	166.7853
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short	160.8866
delay the count joined them in the salon	58.9540
_pardieu_ said villefort he is a noble fellow	33.7768
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment	107.5117
dartagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre	62.1492
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière	105.4557
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea i think i can assist your researches said maximilian	145.2560
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm	423.0755
prince cavalcanti said the latter prince cavalcanti where are you andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name	156.9603
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	114.7126
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never neveri could not to me to a brother said felton	84.9641
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud	288.2075
what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it	69.8907
here is monsieur comminges said dartagnan returning to the cardinal	23.5236
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	199.9299
for the king cried dartagnan	25.2320
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow yes for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two then we shall not meet in paris i fear i shall not have that honor well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow	106.1010
me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse	139.3238
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner	572.4178
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains	206.2446
night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark	188.4251
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france	49.7867
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champsélysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up	90.8795
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time	90.7570
conferences	nan
it is not fernand mondegos treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheardof miseries which were its consequences and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity	257.2272
had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did alberts declaration	82.8624
what cried aramis and athos what planchet planchet added grimaud planchet with a gorget indeed ah gentlemen cried planchet so you are back again in paris	192.5198
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile	92.7147
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides commingess troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to dartagnan and porthos well search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy and i feel no	159.0922
doubt that thanks to dartagnans ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master that poor planchet you speak of him very much at your ease aramis he has probably been killed	182.3894
can it be otherwise	85.1687
by her side i am spanish but the family of morcerf is french and i have heard one of the oldest of the south of france yes replied monte cristo these blazons prove that	71.8708
athos and dartagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer	106.1144
all had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew mme	214.1524
besides i shall only take the time to go and return yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him	49.4170
a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged she demanded what i meant and when i had told her allgiovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this	152.2784
good action god would have blessed us in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich what letters were marked on the linen said monte cristo	144.8074
do you hear the guns pray	125.0760
well i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a café	265.2525
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country porthos opened his mouth to reply	85.7781
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also	161.5116
our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year	65.9649
albert listened with the most profound attention	40.4151
now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very day	110.3958
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn	134.5176
the hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence	149.2224
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake	246.3297
but now we are alonealthough it is immaterial to mewhere are we going into normandy if you like delightful shall we be quite retired	195.6120
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man	109.7374
never	nan
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course	183.1567
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord that is true said his antagonists	343.7628
to how much said she	85.7566
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh recovered	140.3435
to london cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in london that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to me but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none nor i said aramis	59.5290
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	146.7160
_morbleu_ monsieur said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you perhaps said athos	66.6699
what line would you advise me to study the one that is most in use just at this time the spanish one you mean i suppose yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it	85.0212
goodbye	nan
chapter lvi	148.6598
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared	150.1343
juxon was waiting for him impatiently	42.9758
dartagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name	92.0294
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler	102.8449
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	59.1732
do you understand the meaning of my words	28.4149
he delayed presenting himself at morrels but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him	164.5978
what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his fathers intentions were	119.9584
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed	588.4040
formerly a brewer replied the gascon	127.4551
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans	93.8228
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back	153.8048
he had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage	59.9782
she read it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone	111.4796
i must go thither tonight instantly that is to say when you have received my instructions	89.9158
andrea felt his heart leap with joy	107.3930
bonacieux was the very life of dartagnan	87.1765
mazarin rose	102.0843
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place	299.6926
during our expedition to béthune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow	187.0015
so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday	109.4276
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	77.0920
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right	87.1481
let us separate and let us seek the mercers wifethat is the key of the intrigue a woman of such inferior condition can you believe so said porthos protruding his lips with contempt	97.9359
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurators wife was obliged to give place to the king	117.0520
that is why valentine passed through her room which was on a level with valentines and only separated from it by edwards	154.6697
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellowcreatures	160.2123
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory	168.1453
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition	170.0683
let out your prisoner	636.1515
you asked me just now if i was in funds said dartagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table	101.8724
there is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude	135.8852
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia	67.6346
you see that i cannot like you for instance settle on any fixed plan thou liest subtile one said dartagnan to himself	299.7063
as dartagnan had foreseen athos was not within	69.5225
i hope you will not complain now said the jeweller	51.1889
madame he replied monsieur dartagnans prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment	286.4941
may i not go and see my friends yes sir you shall see them	33.2187
what beautiful furniture there must be in it have you ever seen the tuileries no well it surpasses that it must be worth ones while to stoop andrea when that good m	232.8237
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses	111.0985
i thought i did replied athos but no doubt i was mistaken and he returned dartagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it	101.6628
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	52.7830
it appears she resumed that he sold ithe sold it in order to save me another timeto be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his dangerhe sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger i remarked it	128.9637
noirtiers hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound	119.3252
of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all	241.4481
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows	736.5509
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play	439.5253
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand	86.8537
m	nan
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone	39.1818
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped	125.2890
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul	86.4858
once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a halfruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me	192.6053
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it	119.0449
excuse me mr president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i cannot follow you	47.6928
three months passed and still she weptno news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair	145.8565
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below	114.1077
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since	72.7002
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud	110.6773
he was alonealone with these countless these unheardof treasures was he awake or was it but a dream	403.6074
i hope i shall gain renées favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me	495.1942
on hearing the password germain bowed	1004.5657
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	292.2596
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his roomthe red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinalso that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having	112.8590
hung anything more significant than a crawfish	252.4064
dartagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said	79.3285
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much illwill to follow to the end his role as confessor	402.7165
say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated him	186.3368
then they looked at one another	34.7660
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at stay said debray i recognize this hobbema ah indeed yes it was	237.1299
proposed for the museum which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo	70.0567
he had no fears as to how he should livegood seamen are welcome everywhere	458.5280
bonaparte m	798.0428
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves	65.9833
what i propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means	243.9847
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for thema cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one	122.7247
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	109.4838
and then to be here so young oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning	233.5136
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other	66.2101
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	205.1269
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment	92.2766
morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the cloverfield where his cabriolet was still waiting for him	65.1595
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when	372.8336
we were tried for our lives	149.1568
your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired	358.1661
do you not father yes resolutely replied noirtier	216.2284
tell the king that if he sleeps badly tonight he will sleep better tomorrow night these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter	267.9588
you are questioning me like a kings attorney	70.3707
the vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again	40.8998
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore	40.3490
yes said monte cristo has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure i am ready said maximilian i came expressly to wish them farewell whither are you going count asked julie	87.8315
the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire	296.2411
to one in edmonds position the diamond certainly was of great value	338.9857
nay do not press my hand edmond you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness	137.1826
they entered for the door was not lockedthere is much confidence among villagers	324.3144
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	183.6878
the coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative	41.1881
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	258.1286
is he at liberty asked the queen	23.8403
some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close	245.1854
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	77.8355
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected	33.1954
its not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health my health is well enough said fernand clenching his hands without raising his head	143.4064
i am cold sir said mousqueton	62.3825
the parliament condemned charles to death as might have been foreseen	218.7223
and madame de villefort cried baptistin	47.5012
and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece	203.4317
dartagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad	145.9294
danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the door	75.1889
run run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands cries	96.1801
the man who abducted my wife the cardinal rang a second time	94.3810
dartagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returnedstood stillstruck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed i recollect what inquired dartagnan	109.9618
the races like the _moccoli_ are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	68.5221
first madame who are you who am i	132.6651
if you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every precaution	91.1269
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franchecomte	542.9789
he awoke	2167.2385
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said dartagnan	96.1583
the duchess is at tours and the duke at boulogne	76.9959
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel	87.3009
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening	96.9593
i will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak i beg of you valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that	77.0231
nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine	182.9509
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception	211.0681
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by dartagnan	268.3205
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles	168.0228
thomson french were your bankers	207.4959
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her	110.6951
noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him	280.5495
good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another	92.4426
let us return to the object that brings me here what that which brings you home to me	66.8335
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned dartagnan	30.6325
de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except dartagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place	44.9100
as regards the marchesa corsinari really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us will she be wanted in any way no sir replied monte cristo besides has she not yes sir said the major she has m paid the last debt of nature alas yes returned the italian	160.8821
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him	163.8937
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden	82.5276
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field	154.1565
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir	189.3731
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury	160.6607
you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones yes but we do not invite people of fashion	505.5732
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand	50.9655
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf	59.9175
he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death	97.8488
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	83.5556
this mystery required an explanation at least so dartagnan declared to himself	208.6621
come porthos come mousqueton they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible	156.5802
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer	244.3060
speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended	1262.7612
i wont have him killedi wont hes my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him	219.9153
gaetano was not mistaken	29.0050
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him	97.0571
gondy smiled the queens color rose and mazarin grew even paler	566.8751
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival	86.1154
at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder	74.7713
de tréville	2.9157
when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms	74.3101
passing alongside one of them dartagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meungthe same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom dartagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her	136.0937
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers i regard them as invaluable now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety	45.4343
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this do you remember aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel a shudder at the recollection hold	204.3567
just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past	96.8515
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord	253.4260
but dartagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious	44.7670
go and fetch a physician said she	64.6579
but not before one oclock replied dartagnan	143.4443
albert placed it in his buttonhole and the carriage went triumphantly on	61.1266
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect	66.5658
indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates me oh dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	151.7815
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said dartagnan that this abduction of the queens woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration	80.2080
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels	166.1134
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber	113.2454
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan	115.7504
to no one on my honor everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m	57.1499
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions	87.5708
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired	281.4640
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter	75.1432
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh	268.9763
on the staircase he met signor pastrini	50.8838
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover	199.3864
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days	864.1813
come my friend said he courage then he turned to the officer	52.9133
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog yes said porthos twill be at least a little change from beer chapter lxiii	122.3715
on my return vasiliki and her daughter haydée had disappeareddid you know themmy intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty times have you any idea what became of themyes sir i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty	207.3493
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money	238.7425
bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service why because i should never get a better probabilities are deceptive but i deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death do you possess that right	144.8244
over bertuccio yes there are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the counts yes the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirtytwo horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours	431.4193
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	172.9589
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean	375.2541
now i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm	131.5785
alas in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it	97.1985
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday	161.1201
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two oclock she had not returned	47.7137
de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he	50.7001
what do you mean i only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question	77.7301
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said dartagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what must see him whereon the balcony not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur dartagnan is right the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom	136.7826
duplicity is no stranger	298.0984
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down	82.4429
athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street	45.8094
a blasphemy	10989.7363
well let us sleep at noyon said raoul	57.4112
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy	133.0482
the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward	109.4877
she will soon pass she is already late	203.1563
now said athos that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the kings entrance they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the kings arrival	113.0549
but how can i pay them oh nothing easier you have an account open with messrs	195.8941
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness	134.8999
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities	54.6640
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service madame replied dartagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majestys service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you i know that sir i have known that said the queen a long time therefore	66.8127
i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem permit me madame said dartagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done wonders his name asked the queen	169.5480
excuse me sir replied the notary on the contrary the meaning of m	24.7903
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes	172.6574
a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment	45.2778
while dartagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions so that on returning home dartagnan found the reunion complete	194.9772
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	59.0411
before his departure the count went to haydées apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care	189.0652

morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession oh merciful heavens murmured villefort	537.9202
all fell to their knees	203.5323
very good signor pastrini said franz but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately but as for the carriage what as to the carriage exclaimed albert	100.1115
the orders came	254.1333
halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers	87.4137
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme	95.5316
the yard was empty the clock was striking twelve	216.3706
he rose on the waves making signs of distress but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack	157.2676
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget	135.3649
what say you to that monsieur du vallon he added in a low tone to porthos	28.5332
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed	190.2639

chapter xx	49.5048
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves	857.4644
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	143.6403

the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands	61.2154
edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes	115.2553
he would not take them said he with slight emotion	70.6497
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine	225.2080
dartagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for	238.2518
he had within his reach his pistols and carbine and ali standing near him held one of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades	362.3687

endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man	109.1235
ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward dartagnan and i am truly pleased to meet you dartagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre	68.2727
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the	63.0969
name of fernand i maintain my original resolution very well my dear sir then i consent to cut throats with you	140.3961
but dartagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kittys door	343.8701
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray	47.5578
and you cannot deny it added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice	49.6551
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance	67.8822
it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris thats unfortunate oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris but what shall i wear what you find in your trunks in my trunks	198.0589
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable	49.0017
noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person my dear doctor there is no communication between m	121.1914
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villeforts dressingroomi saw i	161.2826

then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am	143.3554

noirtier and the elder dépinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife	264.3575
whose is that letter of your mistress	107.5344
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking	170.6568

he has orders to do so	56.2027
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	446.9939
but he does wrong to use his privilege	273.8497
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss	101.4510
have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges	62.0749
was born	1009.2426
is this all no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal and the house of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly francs in all francs it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration	111.0065
yours cried she throwing back her veilyours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten	118.1846
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure	117.5748
then valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds	221.9263
he resembles his mother so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in	48.7907
speak the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him	89.7259
it is no use said the old man there is no wine what no wine said dantès turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards	63.0751
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary i said the queen	172.1367
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood	147.7406
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came	179.2293
what could explain athoss having reentered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table	480.2301
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly	232.0229
louis xiii	2.2768
if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself you do not understand me maximilian	68.7519
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the city	323.9872
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian pardon me you are right	49.9102
anne of austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself but this was not what louis xiii	132.0853
madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them	246.7553
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering	149.4147
this moment come my lord said dartagnan	40.4509
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself	195.7596
we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay go go exclaimed dantès	155.0793
you must love somebody no i am alone in the world then you will love me	45.3368
the curate related the incident to the count of sanfelice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month	100.7948
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	208.0921
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex	325.8683
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps	101.4183
what replied the englishman	85.3930
davrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son villefort suffocating pressed the doctors arm	254.1789
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her	145.2547
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime	193.1295
you were always a merry companion my dear dartagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you	154.0208
de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you	16.3956
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	190.3647
in which we hear tidings of aramis	225.2408
never never the devil said athos	48.4167
morrel held out his hand to her	20.8053
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter	311.8298
it was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as milady	208.7947
these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi and teresa	185.9771
he is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart	47.1705
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond	125.9223
then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of forges they stopped on the road but you continued yours	106.2675
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will	266.3161
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared	263.2537
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	46.1199
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected	89.4225
shall you keep it or send it back i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it	75.1850
faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice but i cried morrel groaning with sorrow i love her you lovewhom cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven	129.7375
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping milady reseated herself foaming	102.4514
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth	228.2216
mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like automedon of antiquity	145.4919
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered	77.9790
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a firstrate esquire after bowing to athos and dartagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes	125.9070
were riveted	4355.7354
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged	59.2317
danglars	nan
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman	183.0545
why did he detain her	59.2584
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids	76.9473
yes but never with the same advantages said dartagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight very good very good said the voice	72.7543
no no said he	13.0942
i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me	92.3333
no said morrel is someone dead in his house the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness	93.0767
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier	74.6659
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it	142.2226
the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl	118.0913
do you wish to go to m	10.5471
de tréville launched it with knowledge of his cause	132.6476
advise me what i had better do emmanuel returned my sister the house of morrel can only be carried on by a morrel	179.1068
were consumed or nearly sohe commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous porthos indecent and aramis ridiculous	1363.9506
she cried out but davrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left	131.8201
shall we return to the camp said porthos	19.3696
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt	295.8304
bonacieux would have any suspicion	67.3814

monte cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit	108.8065
were it liquid gold monsieur blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine	1049.0276
he thought of that young and pretty mme	200.3392
take some she said	246.7218
yes said he i came quickly i wanted to speak to you are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt	77.7847
do you know the decision we have come to mother have we come to any yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercédès sighed	97.6649
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor womans head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees	94.6627
but where are you going to eat my breakfast asked the host	25.0724
chapter xliv	168.3330
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells	124.8370
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern	96.9043
him	nan
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos stopan idea cried porthos indeed my dear dartagnan i dont know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace raoul woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself i wouldnt give a farthing for	107.9768
his life they set out	197.6482
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house	130.7538
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted	117.5656
they reached the rue st honoré and in the place du palaiscardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades	117.8991
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner	200.3496
the apparition chapter	782.5110
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there	65.7867
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them	81.5746
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument	134.0786
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father the king was not mistaken	71.2149
de tréville in a somewhat softened tone	166.2837
i remember now yes it was aboutstop a minuteyes it was about a woman thats it replied athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk yes that was it said dartagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes yes who was hanged by her husband	110.3463
who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued dartagnan looking intently at athos	75.4254
they looked for m	136.4959
little flirtations perhaps and thats all	602.2381
ah cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression ah i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for	127.1875
that i took away	142.0576
bertuccio left	238.1469
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks	99.9372
what has he to say inquired the young man who was in command in the chiefs absence	51.3801
villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied	225.1410
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the counta warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made the counts first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception to draw his attention from a	155.2955
minor danger in order to expose him to a greater	79.8489
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything	75.8270
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish	222.6624
my lord said dartagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinarythat is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation	302.9923
we ought to die together	48.2588
nay it must have been a promise a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh let them answered dartagnan	118.6781
mouston	nan
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road the devil he does money and a large sum said mazarin	112.4490
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer	108.6677
look at it aramis the roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation	268.4119
are you there asked porthos	20.0608
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago m no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	65.0308
the guide carried away the torch	178.0936
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half	146.3809
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	60.7019
stop gentlemen said albert i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo in private asked morrel	37.2324
good heavens we are on the very eve of it	62.5478
let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertaintieswretched waking dreams of griefthe first rays of morning pierced his windows	198.3445
and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence	164.4562
what would you have me say give all the information in your power tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little have you served under the usurper i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell it is reported	101.7512
your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation	81.7337
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale	22.5382
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road	190.2906
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him	199.4824
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	271.4233
at daybreak dartagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done	43.0243
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother	69.9890
henrietta maria and mazarin	250.2877
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all	137.5203
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	75.3548
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm	86.1210
patrick uttered a loud cry	20.6044
joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no	157.3917
and according to his custom dartagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him	168.0057
dartagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	125.8268
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at you at me yes albert reflected	185.2622
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed	220.4422
dont lose a word of what im going to say to you porthos	53.4769
i leave you therefore as i took yourich but little respected	340.4156
the first object that met the eyes of dartagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions	150.7958
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	112.8018
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	9.4309
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	117.4558
oh why did i not tell you all	25.0403
you to be sure said dartagnan pressing athoss hand	101.5884
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know boistracy is an intimate friend of mine and i cannot allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your	107.9003
reclamation i refuse it on account of the form the fact is hazarded dartagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis	116.0812
the one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch	269.9704
submit this honour to somebody else and he sat down	111.1300
and to sign the contract in three days yes then in my turn i also say very well danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	86.1736
one day you will be able to understand how all this is well then to the king your nephew	33.3845
yesyour friend at least hopes so come upstairs with me and i will give it to you i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	62.5174
then m	372.2894
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest	173.1312
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans	110.5537
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor	632.3369
you know or you dont know that that is what we ask of you oh yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises charles had heard and understood it all	156.5845
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies	319.7891
bonacieux entered	170.5063
well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure	157.2536
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	430.7001
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground	194.5812
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour	620.1886
do you remember how he cried on dartagnan on i am taken	83.7623
we were once four valiant knightsfour hearts fondly united let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes	393.6043
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf said he	59.8640
hollo whats the matter at the château dif said the captain	46.4375
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this castle	53.6993
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friendsto athos and aramiswas apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety	130.9061
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis	67.0189
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride	65.7942
he brought me up as if i had been his son and in he married	76.8696
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons	301.9781
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty	177.9970
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him	190.2537
i have promised to escort to the académie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription ah in truth madame to do that i must forget the hours conversation i have had with you which is indeed impossible monte cristo	134.1312
bowed and left the house	25.0333
what do you mean asked valentine	11.0249
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed hat	166.3879
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was all	87.1766
danglars at the other and eugénie in front of him	95.3143
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledgehammer	90.2754
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion	71.4627
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	132.6097
fly then cried mademoiselle darmilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished fly or kill yourself said eugénie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary	553.8029
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter	258.2953
you cannot beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the childs whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him	127.6956
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened	45.5069
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do	75.6218
not let us leave him during the whole evening	56.3036
he had not done so for ten years before	38.0999
she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinkingfor since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent feverafter which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted	202.9055
away in the surrounding atmosphere	182.9697
the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture	129.7668
i do not know you i am said i the little abbé who reads _lives of the saints_ and translates judith into verse ah ah i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone well what do you want with me i want you to spare time to take a walk with me tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest pleasure	91.4355
no not tomorrow morning if you please but immediately if you absolutely insist i do insist upon it come then	183.2153
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever	137.0237
my first business will be to dispose of this diamond so saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse	99.2145
arrived in london you will seek buckingham i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator frankly and loyally repeated	170.7628
milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity	116.8178
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the th of february not quite twentysix murmured the voice at that age he cannot be a traitor oh no no cried dantès	143.0419
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer youso much for the world	427.4419
monsieur dartagnan monsieur dartagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy monsieur dartagnan oh what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds thou good mousqueton where is thy master you stand upon his property but how handsome thou arthow fat thou hast prospered and grown stout and dartagnan could not restrain	219.8059
his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one	267.4619
what do you want	6.0659
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune dartagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he dartagnan had been forced to run the comtes de	172.3197
wardes through the body in order to reach england	94.3697
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oclock	127.0516
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me this voice startled her	76.5498
but no his heart is beating	245.2270
what	nan
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m	161.6472
this treasure exists dantès and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will	70.0617
we shall see returned the other smiling	144.1639
ah ah said he she is asleep thats well	74.6935
anne then motioned to dartagnan to approach and he obeyed	127.9960
at the same moment a wellknown voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people athos shuddered from head to foot	145.6985
no quarter cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them tremble	269.9174
in the commandments of god or of the church i dont know which	110.7992
the count sat down	39.9706
if an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the united states and you are located in the united states we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying distributing performing displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed	37.3474
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness	58.1898
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation	88.3463
he entered and on his way met the waiter	114.6201
a loud cry could be heard by her	65.1413
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume	108.8947
i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage then i have your leave sir yes if you have nothing more to say to me nothing captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me he was unable to write sir	90.6044
cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal dukeall things which appeared to dartagnan monstrous impossibilities	355.3569
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you dartagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in miladys soul whose depths were dark and unknown	114.8804
i will enter a cloister i will become a nun said milady	93.1625
his name tell it me then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistancefor i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than deaththe executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once	110.2511
a frightful cry of pain and shame	114.7280
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton	138.5813
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to dartagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion	51.5287
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	142.0894
beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days	77.2663
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	168.4469
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless when monte cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded doorpost	70.3305
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	142.4400
everything that savors of mystery charms them	1292.3912
edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber	47.9983
noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	65.3189
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him	75.5144
certainly not certainly not exclaimed mazarin	304.1015
my sole heir that i have bu	144.5038
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give you dartagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	90.2229
diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel i confess i prefer the convent of noisy athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter	103.5174
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after alberts departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy	327.0823
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo	16.5046
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling	288.8316
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead	67.5955
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this	100.8134
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draughtall these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of	356.8387
the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici	260.1461
at the moment when he was about to retire she was cheered with a ray of hope for she thought he was about to speak but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth and making a powerful effort to control himself he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips and went out	47.5036
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	136.2919
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards	41.2788
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore	100.0526
the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine	397.8331
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful	98.3806
i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud at this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed	68.9205
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the periodmeanness stinginess fasts but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurators wife had been tolerably liberalthat is be it understood for a procurators wifehe hoped to see a household of	253.6087
a highly comfortable kind	994.9484
now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable to no one by heaven i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out	192.3041
of a place	155.5485
mousqueton trembled in all his members	164.9065
danglars left	233.3386
the first time he saw dartagnan you have come off well said he to him there is your jussac thrust paid for	118.7664
adieu my noble and generous friend adieu i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the counts hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo	172.9963
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair	179.8338
monte cristo bent his head	9.1980
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock	61.8774
then listen to me	52.0494
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me well well the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the	74.9414
step to embrace me a last time my brothers servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop but dartagnan dartagnan if he comes shall we not know it how nothing easier	119.1389
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came	127.7647
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldnt serve mazarin	310.0706

cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide no no continued dartagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman	307.7542

what is it said dartagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance	61.5516
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle	85.5426
his two companions were already on horseback	60.3654

there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneysgeneral and bailiffs	1169.6266
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantomlike the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures	298.3641
a learned italian chapter	653.8713
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor	114.4464
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful what a cold wind resumed athos a wintry blast	246.1138
_holà_ bazin bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked dartagnan	82.8419

after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come	47.2402
dartagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door	17.1128
do you talk of a sacrifice i do do you then suspect anyone i suspect no one death raps at your doorit entersit goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room	386.4279
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak very well said dartagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet	123.4158

edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead yes dead alas i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept what could i do	128.8981
for you edmond besides pray and weep	711.2261
to a look of interrogation which they made milady replied by a sign that it was he	66.7559
i remained in the room and waited oh heaven m when daylight dawned i went down again	159.0396
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments _quærens quem devoret_	159.6950

then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you proceed said monte cristo	78.5429
take a cigar really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rosecolored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled standhow happy you are to have nothing to do	187.2991

well asked the president what do you say to this letter general i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii	66.0070
grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger	90.6200

to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian your guardian is he too a bragelonne asked lord de winter	92.7649
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do	181.1508
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to you there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching	115.0461
dartagnan dressed himself and athos did the same	94.2359
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin	112.0896
we separated at midnight	757.7962

dont be afraid said he smiling	32.6030
he is a priest said bragelonne he has worn the tonsure	156.4958
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion	76.3384
simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton	232.5611
he saw dartagnans movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once	60.7516
then your grace knows her real name asked felton in a sharp tone	90.4607
and now my good friend said dartagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man dartagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of	76.2917
one of the valets	43.5796
do you think of him yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans what are you saying	146.3449
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal	69.6450
for what purpose upon my honor i will instantly return it to you	64.3772
yes sir she replied every confidence speak will the queen deign to follow my advice speak let your majesty dismiss m	283.9678
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of	115.9008
the company of his son	50.6678
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye	161.6952
do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated oh yes i read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory repeat it to me dantès paused a moment then said this is it word for word the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate	177.6796
on board the _pharaon_ this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and portoferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris	98.4183
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road	134.1367
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am dartagnan dont you know me	37.5664
the steps were already down and the door open	98.7313
i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you then said albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance what is the next oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamoretrees on the borders of a lake in the waters	119.8781
of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror	301.7139
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea	120.6073
see paragraph below	2015.9440
you think of everything said dartagnan and i thank you for planchet my dear athos raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed	64.9836
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	318.6008
in the name of heaven duke leave me go i do not know whether i love you or love you not but what i know is that i will not be perjured	51.3210
franz dépinay an expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes	67.0166
oh said porthos	26.4994
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duelcalculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust	430.7005
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open	207.0729
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance	80.9974
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything	72.7645
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine	190.3200
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to parisso that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed	168.0227
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees	188.7442
you do not like dantès i never like upstarts then tell me all you know about the catalane i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries what have you seencome tell me well every time i have	95.0497

the young man was opening the door of the stable	24.2964
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heavens name my strength is failing me i am dying the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos	285.8817
dartagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her winewhich was a horrible production from the country of montreuiland heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville the other was a convent	106.8446
of jesuits and was the propertya by no means unusual circumstanceof these worthy fathers	489.1811
let us come to some conclusion	64.8566
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment dartagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris and did not stop till he came to athoss door	148.5384
then he determined to go up	29.1884
monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passersby and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed	130.9117
it is he cried dartagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he let me overtake him he	47.5301
twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch	317.0259
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a	93.5156
prisoner said athos pointing to raoul	30.2048
de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient gentlemen said châteaurenaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriagefaith it is franz and debray the two young men he announced were indeed approaching	142.7508
we have secured him yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason porthos pressed his friends hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charless retreat was advancing to meet the english regiments	226.8939

will you go away from here demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry	151.9756
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating	169.7937
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy	196.2792
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him	182.9584
the three young people separatedthat is to say morrel went to the boulevards châteaurenaud to the pont de la révolution and debray to the quai	101.5868

the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited dartagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place	118.5796
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin	558.1476
hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color	113.2262
then you were going to rueil yes i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence you must still deliver it said athos	48.5608
you can understand that one of two things must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from a height of ninety feet must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remainedpoor fellow then you pity him said the count	109.5373
felton was sent away	56.2682

he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality	67.9560
you disturb me	146.2105
at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers	85.5591
the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed	293.3559
aha what blood at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered	124.8707
only their wish to see each other had become a necessity and they would have preferred death to a days separation	149.9478
of danglars yes to be sure must i say baron danglars	238.3526
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis	205.4566
in the lucern patch chapter	131.3513
oh take ittake it said the count haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room	176.2142
nevertheless monsieur de trévilles company of musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will	129.5599
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end	65.1693

my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	119.5942
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	79.5564
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you	80.6594
mazarin again	588.3712

mazarin pretended to laugh	114.6253
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting	115.9936
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear	27.3048
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim m	72.3855

i congratulate you my dear m	36.3183
i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke and even then when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces	168.1802
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks	264.0583
albert related it to his mother châteaurenaud recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the counts courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	156.1256
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel	93.1563

franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a seagull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica	84.6917

you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of albert de morcerf	75.2145
dartagnan was the youngest of all these men	45.4187
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled	46.5602
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly	90.2103
davrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m	89.7251
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell	75.2363
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held	62.9353
dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you	29.7052
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia	82.0303
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive i indeed	81.7408
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them	51.3659
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank	218.0545
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful sit down in mercy dartagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge	134.2155
as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master	119.4042
oh you will not abandon me you will not leave me to perish you will not be pitiless cried mordaunt	53.6300
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog	152.7704
dartagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour	120.7834
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves	279.6645
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him	168.3838
his first cry was for his father but that father was dead my father too is dead said morrel	86.4624
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed	130.6403
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed	260.8976
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty no no blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and _pardieu_ you know his fathers name his father yes noirtier noirtier the girondinnoirtier the senator he himself and your majesty has employed the son of such a man blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	153.8487
the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after m	46.3283
he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered	210.5326
i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles	72.9014
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky	76.4339
eugénie danglars i cannot in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp	131.1468
cavalcantis asked beauchamp	539.6400
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future	178.4854
that is not difficult	23.7100
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner	113.3020
they will not dare to refuse me then and i will return to paris and will see you again and will be happy for an instant	33.2290
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head	25.0596
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped	49.3625
the balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck him	188.5031
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then goodbye to the _pharaon_	170.3338
it bears his signature as you see which is allsufficient bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket	148.4262
dartagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurators wife and dartagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortunethe best mistress possible	98.2625
for pitys sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressingfor pitys sake do not call assistance save mei will not harm you andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies	225.0761
there remains the valise added porthos	717.6932
has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance to whom did he give up his sword he did not give it up he broke it he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it	73.7366
to still more advantage there was a momentary pause	386.6490
under that pretense you run against me you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient	110.2747
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven	1032.3789
she had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of sanfelices daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her	62.5982
sblood he escapes us so much the better muttered athos	72.8047
i was pretty drunk yesterday dartagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous	152.8709
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor	41.4989
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it	44.7245
grimaud made a sign that he was not	6.4565
i have not seen such a one four times in my life	41.8036
you offer me your services with the same frankness i accept them	122.4597
danglars be there he has already been invited by my father	93.0461
albert bathed took his supper and went to bed	102.7514
that was the sloop	56.3873
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once i cannot believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it	128.3650
and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	134.9423
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m	62.2816
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving	628.2678
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis	152.6887
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking hush said la ramee and one by one he sent away the guards	102.3964
on various pretexts	17561.1309
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell usbut i will believe all you say so proceed but if	54.0579
your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience	139.4223
sometimes we dont go to bed at all well what of that why he would be annoyed if i did not play with him does he play well i have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down bring him with you then but how about our prisoners let your servants guard them	127.3982
yes and give them a chance of escaping said dartagnan	65.9048
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope	46.0273
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies	251.4717
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it	107.7148
bonacieux it is a man i dont know although he seems to be coming here	53.3342
i embrace you with all my heart	46.4160
i did not even touch your hand and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord	139.0442
he immediately signalled it	2447.5122
no well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful	154.8829
what a disgrace to us oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too an excuse for us to meet dartagnan with a false excuse to have to make a false excuse to porthos oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the	122.8618
most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship	483.5304
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass what	110.4050
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he therefore went forward without a moments hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half	165.7964
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts	200.2069
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened	321.9596
bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the louvre appropriated for the people of the household	63.7864
yes madame said the young man	6.5206
you must take grimaud and olivain both sir asked raoul astonished	263.0928
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me	116.4997
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear dartagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray dartagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took	102.1471
it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure	158.8705
eight oclock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep	271.2470
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters	1264.0608
you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room was i pale albert yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself did your father speak of it inquired mercédès eagerly	162.9895
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him	230.9012
dartagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench the two guards marched abreast with him and the two soldiers followed behind	73.5979
dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yardarm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death	159.3300
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	104.2105
was she dead	506.6519
the tumult was indescribable	472.3711
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash	415.7671
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many	258.3082
voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their _ciceronian_ tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands	164.3470
the rendezvous chapter	464.3873
listen	nan
she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydée said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something	78.4750
eh	nan
help me out of paris help me out of france i cannot take you however to the siege of la rochelle said dartagnan	50.6586
the three windows were still untenanted	135.1613
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m	57.0811
the flight	7357.7197
a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared	55.1955
de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers the countess made no reply	64.2798
what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar	187.4830
the father of m	95.0218
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated	203.9422
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other i dont say exactly answered the gascon confused	52.2068
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur	151.9868
she wouldnt believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb	79.1726
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	38.6631
but why has he waited till now	125.3215
then i must go to the rue st honoré in order to purchase some rouge for madame de chevreuse	48.1108
the council of the musketeers chapter xlviii	49.5249
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	32.9195
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do	220.1717
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord	103.3319
do you not think with me m	19.6007
edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins	134.5026
monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie i should think so indeedalmost as high as a tower you told him it was for me yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands	108.7689
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs	458.4593
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m	57.8497
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m	37.2055
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a cry	47.0904
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them	171.8215
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month	103.0376
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared	84.9768
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half	61.3304
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved	160.7800
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the kings musketeers in these quarrels	170.0396
kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women	86.9262
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him	298.0405
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions	58.0305
just reflect a little what an agitation the queens mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years it is true said porthos	164.2037
and how proceed it is now eleven answered grimaud	299.8497
planchet turned and returned the billet	104.9135
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck	203.7279
strength and sagacity	142.8994
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of henry iv	156.5746
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture	125.0427
now as these street arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of thomson french	230.2103
come fanny we will put her to bed m	146.5367
yes madame said dartagnan but get in fearlessly for i myself will drive you the queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her side	88.4084
yes replied beauchamp	56.2606
at his mothers ball he danced once with eugénie and m	411.7176
ali had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the gates of st sebastian	85.2545
i have replied morrel	64.3662
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly	144.7641
had you then that sum the queens famous diamond answered dartagnan with a sigh	114.1403
the shade of cardinal richelieu	181.9662
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering	39.7695
fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends	76.0444
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my paywhich i am never paid by the wayto make the king five years older really and pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands	118.0013
himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv	218.1132
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them	112.9871
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	204.9677
i must have left it in my room she said	34.7993
la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant la ramee became therefore the dukes dinner guest by compulsionan eternal keeper the shadow of his person but la rameegay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had	227.9109
one defect in the dukes eyeshis incorruptibility	655.5319
procureur you must go farther back that voice that voicewhere did i first hear it you heard it for the first time at marseilles twentythree years ago the day of your marriage with mademoiselle de saintméran	101.4359
a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain	73.5493
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman	114.3351
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip	130.8554
jesus seigneur no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rushed out	81.2273
debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them as debray walked towards the window danglars approached his wife	106.4695
i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home	114.6376
oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person	197.2248
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever	72.4271
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage	72.1832
you see said raoul we have done wisely what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche	149.2887
the inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed he will become religioushe is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonetsmadmen are not afraid of anything i made some curious observations on this at charenton then turning to the prisoner what is it you want said he	156.2289
it was like a besieged town	145.1397
halt he cried this time we shall be pursued	42.8646
at the door of the chapel dartagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos but athos had disappeared	70.7089
let the man go dartagnan let us save the woman monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat eh monsieur eh friend said dartagnan a halfpistole for that paper my faith monsieur with great pleasure here it is the hostler enchanted with the good days work he had	179.9615
done returned to the yard	111.4466
ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable	80.8204
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms	30.4680
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest	15.6872
did parliament pass this act athos asked of him in english	678.1601
the old servant came	125.0891
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	480.1667
fernands fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune	383.0653
alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments i need a friend do you suffer much asked the monk	152.0017
m but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn	83.4942
the audience chapter iv	471.9496
the count laid his hand on franzs shoulder	58.3298
they were thus perpetually employedfaria that he might not see himself grow old dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night	225.2516
the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the startingpost	231.2235
the handle of this saucepan was of iron dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it	72.5116
besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming onthat this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible	173.1714
you have lived on the money he has given you true said caderousse benedetto has become the son of a great lord how can he be the son of a great lord a natural son and what is that great lords name the count of monte cristo the very same in whose house we are benedetto the counts son replied monte cristo astonished	79.5926
in his turn	19.3295
seven oclock said grimaud who had not spoken a word	42.4051
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows	192.3455
nests in china	139.0541
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention	180.4611
this is a kind of usury banker that i do not understand take all thentake all i tell you and kill me come come calm yourself	112.0418
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed	342.6797
in three seconds dartagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos and one for aramis at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log	179.3622
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourselfwhom he considered the first three personages in france dartagnan added m	128.9981
ah mother nanette cried friquet suffocating ah mother nanette he could say no more but though he hadnt strength to speak he had enough for action	285.9904
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarrons pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers	343.0454
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats	189.2597
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of gods mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my fathers tomb by your fathers tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and halfraising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred	130.9513
who then are you the count had watched the approach of death	83.5685
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tonguetied	239.8316
it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful	31.2686
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by	155.8467
far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europethe english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	208.3764
give him the despatch raoul you are the chevaliers prisoner raoul gave it up reluctantly aramis instantly seized and read it	344.7987
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive	83.4544
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m	91.8403
they proceeded thus to peronne	466.8954
he knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments but whence did these impediments arise	270.2076
you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead	69.7696
now that i have the word of athos i can set out dartagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queens presence	93.2886
i am quite resigned	123.4629
i indeed invited them here today on your account	282.6546
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly	200.5888
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	200.9377
your excellency has not stated the number of guests ah true how many covers count for yourself is everyone here your excellency yes bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar	156.7283
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say why yes replied dartagnan with embarrassment	102.7921
the place royalebe it so replied athos	292.9335

that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champsélysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner	121.0253
the procurator repeated several times ah madame coquenard accept my compliments your dinner has been a real feast	350.4615
embrace also our good and brave porthos	408.5015
from the queen replied the servant	51.4899
it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit	100.9616
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortunesir i cannot understand your generosity oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something m what have you to offer to me my friend	82.2842
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other	77.8550
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of dartagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady said he	43.0219
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth	420.9646
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel châteaurenaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m	247.7286
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black fleetheir instinct telling them that for the time all was over	135.8329
unlimited credit chapter	501.1166
then davrigny spoke	1023.1859

they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming	141.7478
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars	52.0341
and all thisall this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a womans voice	143.1826
de monte cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at rome and naples i expressed my fears of travelling as a woman he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a mans passport and two days after i received this to which i have added with my own hand travelling with his sister m well said eugénie cheerfully we	125.8816

of haitian bonds	5765.8125
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy	193.9648
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	178.1768
the beggar the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced	91.7190
good heavens how can you tell me that does that alarm you cried dartagnan	50.2608
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon	205.7720
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated	147.4263
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans therefore with the puritans we must go good my friend good said athos	115.7089

imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered everything	1526.6848
i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet	1463.7891
he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance	45.0283
yes the servant has given his description	117.1490
must we then asked anne of austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal seriously	295.1901
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare	686.5173
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion	143.9875
dartagnan therefore returned to the rue férou	30.1542
well it is a question of serving the king the gentlemans duty but the king is with mazarin he is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the kings enemies are preparing for the poor child ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis war for the king yet the king	109.3248
will be at the head of the army on mazarins side but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort monsieur de beaufort	34.3133
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	84.6344
but this i know that i had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by nightsilentlylike cowards	252.6707
back people cried dartagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business here indeed as if de rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall	139.6252
everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts	117.2351
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable	90.6897
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i dont know yet	71.4359
but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too	109.4377
mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself	91.5949
at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes this was delirium	417.5727
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles societymagistrates who had resigned their office during the usurpers reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the	186.1303
man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god	291.0374
davrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man	142.9355
i do not know whether you remember that this is the th of september it is ten years today since i saved your fathers life who wished to die morrel seized the counts hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him	58.7235
i returned last night and here i am what circumlocution how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know because in truth albert you hesitate yesi fear you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you	153.3094

refusing to give laporte the young kings valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself	142.5858
in that manner	55.7553
let us see said athos	7.2990
lord de winter went out making a sign to felton who followed him shutting the door after him	25.9840
from a distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of _la jeune amélie_ and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landingplace he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident	196.6720
you have once before thrown yourself in my path	202.1785
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance	104.6676
however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work	156.2278
you hear meat a quarter past midnightin fact in twenty minutes i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do	156.8649
ones self is ever well done i shall abide by that rule grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it	128.1477
all at once theres a noise like a cannonthats the air blowing up the deck	201.6749
the rest of the dinner was to come	46.0485
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy	217.0087
well i shall see	20.2943
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke danjou his brother	60.0898
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	58.5989
his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his forehead	28.3516
where are you asked the valetdechambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom	111.2478

major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin	246.8962

they are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers those are all asked grimaud	366.9404
really if the house had not belonged to the fatherinlaw of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off	118.2416
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the counts stopped before the hôtel de londres	48.8181
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii	215.7120
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions	121.7545
aramis cried athos dont fire ah ha is it you aramis said porthos	87.7535
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us	120.4666
scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream the jeweller smiled	108.6981
the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the st eustache church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling	179.9818
while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound miladys hands together	158.8384
this woman passed for his sister	209.3264
de villefort send for the priest _i_ will be the avenger what do you mean sir asked villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel	105.0648
and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed	217.6160
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going	207.3944
the interview	3045.3755
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity	58.8311
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious	135.6883
love affairs had become his enemies	443.6335
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperors intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouchedmy friend said my mother when your masters	130.7304
orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you notyes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly	283.6260
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it	282.9164
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m	162.7657
my name has been mentioned to youthe comte de la fere you do not know that name	28.8707
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage	179.5639
forsooth i dont know half a pistole if you can find out said dartagnan	47.0346
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris she inquired	61.5994
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort	217.7101
as soon as he arrives inform me	59.8380
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock	121.3147
lord winters tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two	154.1048
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure	114.4057
i asked the price they told me it was francs	203.0419
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at dartagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look	167.1826
alas he would not	31.7835
leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage	221.6109
the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the samaritaine a singular introduction you will find that it is as good as another patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him	149.3701
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints	134.8852
the bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom	60.4275
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please	54.1036
he went to him	16.6678
i swear it before heaven and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward	159.9799
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him	93.7242
i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also how could i pronounce that word	153.7504
so important a negotiation should i think be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence	140.9106
these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercédès coloring	159.7401
thus for instance dont you in the first place want a horse yes a horse well then i can just suit you ah said porthos brightening thats well as regards my horse but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres three hundred	152.1761
livres	nan
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed	159.8325
ah but you are joking my worthy man said dartagnan	42.9992
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way	75.1773
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress but then you would be close to the sea that is what i hoped and supposing you had succeeded i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near herethe isle de daume or the isle de tiboulenand then i should have been safe could	94.6861
you have swum so far heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost all yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me tell me at least who you are i ami am no you mistrust me then said dantès	170.9665
take it said she and be accursed athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec	121.3837
i married exclaimed monte cristo shuddering who could have told you so no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince	86.7917
a dinner in the old style	136.8089
ah you fellows are good managers you ride on our lackeys horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads	194.0461
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration	219.4712
de morcerf interrupted morrel	82.0097
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali	102.4389
what do you require then i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke she is found said milady	108.5453
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance	208.5085
you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to remain on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go	47.3401
blood and anger mounted to his face he was resolved to unravel the mystery	82.3634
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed dartagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way dartagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock	69.0576
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother	91.2724
we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes and we shall have complete success do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning _parbleu_ said albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome like lawyers clerks i hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes only i	190.3097
tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day and as i am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said franz i warn you that as i have been four times before at rome i know the prices of all the carriages we will give you twelve piastres for today tomorrow and the day after and	77.4478
then you will make a good profit but excellencysaid pastrini still striving to gain his point	158.4060
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared i must have said the duke a proof of his connection with buckingham a proof cried milady i will have ten well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and i will send him to the bastille so far	75.3064
good monseigneur but afterwards when once in the bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low voice	82.4722
forward blaisois a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank	135.9030
at that moment dartagnan opened his eyes	15.8327
marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hatfontrailles with his arm in a slingwounded guardshorses bleeding eh then what are the sentinels about	192.8213
picture to yourself a pretty coachhouse at the righthand side where the ladders are kept	220.2450
you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly how so said andrea	139.9192
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars	61.8554
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology but alas but what the paragraph was correct my friend what	91.9389
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason	64.5564
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father	104.0021
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé dherblay and in spite of bazins assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion	105.4341
never sire i entreat you to do so besides in what manner can i make advances first by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her what is that give a ball you know how much the queen loves dancing	136.9198
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertakers men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial	124.5942
plan of campaign chapter xx	78.1531
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed and porthos and aramis i could not find them they did not come but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them yes monsieur well dont budge then if they come tell them	122.7105
what has happened	10.4110
the king came out first from his room	74.7890
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfs when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort	143.2725
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars	134.6568
morrel looked attentively on villefort	172.5686
do you know what consoled him	30.6729
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england	48.2293
oh no there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu i dont even know their names yes but in regard to myself my lord it cannot be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence you think you were i am	75.7215
certain of it ah stay i fancy i remember it	223.4215
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also	90.7155
will you eat any of these beans cousin porthos said mme	212.3620
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory oh murmured valentine	80.1628
we shall try to persuade the great daguesseau m	105.4835
no i do not jest _mordieu_ i should like to have seen you in my place i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied dartagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm	82.0763
he leaped towards a dressingroom near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailors jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair	124.9653
he stood badly with the liberal papers but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists	225.6902
a few dingy olives and stunted figtrees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict	667.3270
oh i declare to you felton i thought him mad yes yes i replied he	105.5622
at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed	140.6196
at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor	49.2569
de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m	84.8386
la ramees mouth watered and he returned to the dukes chamber rubbing his hands	100.6567
she had still her nymphlike form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with anne of austria over the moat of the tuileries in	157.2763
you were right sir said anne	39.3436
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orangetree one after another	229.3309
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea	96.7080
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged	463.4693
you will restore them to her majesty and as a last memorialhe looked round for some valuable objectyou will add he still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade	151.3536
from the top of an eminence dartagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur	70.2383
this he said to planchet must be the archbishops chateau the abode of the fair madame de longueville but the convent where is that the convent your honor is at the other end of the village i know it well well then planchet gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horses girth and come back and tell me if there is a	103.7963
light in any of the jesuits windows in about five minutes planchet returned	182.1457
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass it is singular said the doctor i was not aware that madame de saintméran was subject to such hallucinations it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine and this morning	99.0034
she frightened me so that i thought her mad and my father who you know is a strongminded man himself appeared deeply impressed we will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone	165.8194
it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge	74.0591

well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	57.2371
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully	55.0454
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to	114.7838
beauchamp i do and i will tell you why	55.2855
if perchance m	11090.3584
well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy tréville thats impossible it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty jussac one of	149.5294
the first swordsmen in the kingdom well sire for once he found his master i will see this young man trévillei will see him and if anything can be donewell we will make it our business when will your majesty deign to receive him tomorrow at midday tréville shall i bring him alone no bring me all four together	140.5643
de morcerf will accompany me bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six oclock	133.8845
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something	96.6372
valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and villefort was biting his lips with vexation while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance	56.2017
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because i am only twenty the young woman looked at him furtively	101.4802
although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible	107.9315
we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	104.9950
yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly	105.8659
how has this terrible past been recalled cried villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame alas said hermine doubtless it is chance chance replied villefort no no madame there is	154.3327
no such thing as chance oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this	256.2466
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay	91.4968
thats well said athos let us go home and read it the note burned the hand of dartagnan	42.2060
you see said he calling dartagnans attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hours walk we have made a tour of my domains all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied dartagnan	143.1746
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out	77.5002
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m	53.4805
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	101.1482
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done	120.4770
certainly there are people whom i love	96.6295
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral	695.0690
let us wait for a dénouementfor the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court madame de longueville was persuaded	71.6863
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	29.8676
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets	120.8998
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to love any of us the old mans eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness	105.0546
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly	125.2726
oh dearest marie she thinks of me then after five years of separation heavens there is constancy then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me grimaud signified his assent	296.1240
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safeconduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time	59.7096
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound	346.9052
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road	150.9198
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man possibly thought dartagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarins compliment	82.0135
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit	157.8665
during this storm gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern	217.9478
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being	223.5514
torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel	92.3840
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love	94.0564
he is at bergen in norway heaven preserve him said the queen	214.9951
davrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters room	195.4899
monsieur said emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to m	136.6736
is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips	80.4453
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear	273.2666
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat	359.5684
this was the price of the queens diamond	37.2239

i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale	85.3906
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse	295.5555
what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel	145.6622
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown	191.8330
horse and rider	452.8528
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further	94.9532
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	141.9384
today is the th of august the st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrivesand it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give youtill then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other when he had concluded his speech beauchamp	143.6386
bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the pressroom	63.3973
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity	128.8636
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria	177.3210
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the hôtel and went to his apartment	98.5973
a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriagedrive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers	131.6351
that worthy prince	886.8246
you are about to see said mousqueton looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold	90.4811
morrel and i think you will be satisfied on that head	38.3363
de saintméran i applied my smellingsalts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied	140.9032
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman and then he was called fernand only fernand fernand mondego you are sure _pardieu_ i have bought enough fish of him to know his name then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal	209.6075
in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me what oh nothing ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego	201.1396
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders and good old penelon making signals to m	445.7708
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	92.1516
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	230.2959
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it immediately	148.4209
well why should not we too belong to a party	221.7870
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around and porthos heaved another sigh	205.0761
haydées only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girls picturesque attitude and appearance	157.2919
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks	137.2851
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	118.5417
still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired	137.5124
oh said athos oh no it is impossible god would not permit such a crime water water cried dartagnan	121.3290
this house in past years did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing	173.8200
franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hôtel de londres was the palace the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase	136.1377
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest	111.4975
a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance	139.9820
de morcerfs murmured mercédès and since he has been here i have watched him well well he has taken nothing yet the count is very temperate mercédès smiled sadly	94.7623
and then there are robbers said la carconte	85.9165
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	207.7025
i cannot believe it murmured the banker	76.2589
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took	133.6797
when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a signa mere fishermans hut	214.4955
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which dartagnans letter had given birth in the mind of her brotherinlaw and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood	117.9679
is it my affair	145.7947
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flowerbeds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain _jardinière_ with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure	278.2817
now as dartagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced himself	208.5877
let us draw lots let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief	99.1548
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him	93.3969
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark	278.3509
then the diamond is safe said he timidly	74.6285
morrel was announced	125.4312
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population	153.3992
grandpapa says it is a panacea valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered	60.6473
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the gravedigger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard	101.7182
it was ten oclock when they arrived	22.1979
six oclock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven oclock dinner was ready and served up	71.4771
the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor	694.5227
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	172.1611
he must wait	207.2631
at what hour inquired a turnkey	557.0328
de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest	127.7006
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m	135.8539
no more edicts no more of the cardinals guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds	447.4907
why are not my frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so be it	120.8911
groslow	nan
he is badly off very badly we are in france and i am spanish so much the worse i had much rather you were french and myself also they would hate us both less nevertheless you consent yes if the thing be possible it is it is i who tell you so make preparations for departure i i am always prepared to go	184.4221
only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before in short if i go will you go too i will try you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many things what are they mazarins face smiling as it was became clouded	168.4052
do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king	43.9454
debray who both mount the ministers arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo	138.0224
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m	296.0918
it is of an original color said aramis i never saw one with such a hide in my life i can well believe it replied dartagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him	89.7939
you wish to see me and you come to england	22.6248
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are	41.0196
you there yes your majesty he answered trembling	745.0366
then bring some wine said dartagnan	164.6942
it was indeed for him that they were there	31.5772
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep	337.3075
the duke walked so fast that dartagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him	105.7051
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready	195.0989
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence you think of starting at once then inquired mordaunt	61.4207
bertuccio appeared	389.6811
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action	271.0618
they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words _this is	112.9785
the head of ali tepelini pasha of i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead i was taken to the slavemarket and was purchased by a rich armenian	117.4115
the sentinel wanted to repulse him but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his graces most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders	58.3974
to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer	411.4377
the hands were white but without delicacy the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality	394.1649
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus	89.0498
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	87.5355
charles shuddered	982.9828
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude	241.3816
m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him	85.9728
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason	196.0699
coolly	nan
meantime dartagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king	70.9573
he is waiting till your majesty is ready i am	55.0763
let us manage it better	107.3764
do you hear said the king	14.7274
you chevalier dherblay to his left	509.5010
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility	449.0359
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dantès entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative	425.8587
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully	110.0584
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness	176.5161
then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic and i on that of the huguenot	146.6112
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	96.0692
your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects	188.6236
the president looked at his auditors	63.0702
he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him	69.5782
do we breakfast or dine	1108.1302
my profession condemns me to celibacy	586.0083
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet	238.4191
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads	278.2722
de tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a cardinal	112.0785
fire fire cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends	95.7474
you are right sir said raoul	15.0726
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush	235.4407
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m	37.4110
i will give them	31.7586
bonacieux	nan
m	nan
you see someone pays me a visit	260.6180
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	207.1760
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation	72.8862
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this doubtless doubtless athos	87.8017
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison	265.6159
i will not detain you monsieur continued the countess i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m	86.3694
of course	33.2793
we will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength up great god said mme	211.1357
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own	60.4042
aramis assumed that perilous charge	1448.1171
m	nan
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all how in the wrong said athos	112.9663
he found athos and aramis philosophizing	117.9765
and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape	150.9961
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction an admirable subject cried the jesuit	306.2928
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur labbé is repeating to me said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse	111.3783
milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened	35.5557
either we shall be attacked or not	59.9643
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion	422.0706
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever	100.9300
laporte place the king in bed laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet	80.3061
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering	111.4296
i reached the lower door	114.7079
the next day athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the act of parliament which summoned the exking charles i to the bar publicly cried	191.3291
this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate	69.8038
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look	90.1952
bazin set out the next day for tours and was allowed eight days for performing his commission	125.4272
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos	37.9113
ah said he i hear a human voice edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisonerhe is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron	199.7624
i learn all in the silence of my apartmentsfor instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote m then remarked the	110.4431
president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingshe is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done	56.2473
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him	69.5458
then too i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again	105.3260
bonacieux	nan
had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of france became desirous that he too should have his guard	368.5395
the king called the cardinal	37.4485
well said the count you do not get out m	17.6885
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover	85.8063
for you know athos	52.3269
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you dartagnan became more and more astonished	167.2825
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes who told you that i had been weeping said she	107.4298
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her	88.7234
dartagnan printedas were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the bastilleat amsterdam by pierre rouge	233.2519
in case i am killed the captains name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning	169.8717
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed	137.6148
how much do i owe this gracious prince what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is right cried the marquise	143.9245
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch	153.8033

soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos dartagnan became hourly more in love with milady	227.2133
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague	202.6891
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one	81.5499

this news was brought to us	87.7865
without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his operaglass and looked another way	121.2097
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort	149.7800
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength	250.9334

worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression	345.5799
dartagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and dartagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what	91.2030

franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m	60.4243
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves	110.8933
you may retire said milady	126.4486
at the footmans announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	175.1787
no monsieur le comte answered the servant i think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes	55.9430
dartagnan dartagnan cried she is it you	181.8040
m it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by valentine during the minute and a half madame de villefort remained in the room	84.6189
dartagnan bent down to his horses neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat	105.7274
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday	116.5976
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred	184.7888
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement	275.5709
he found a young shepherd watching his flock	185.1720

carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino	87.8440
the scheme goes forward it seems on wheels dear friend good what shall i do now nothing it is finished then no not yet i should like to understand said porthos	232.8968
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary	45.1250
m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested	121.9348
we cannot say how long the night seemed to milady but dartagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness	123.3306
ah _parbleu_ thats good said albert with a gloomy tone	58.8087
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects	918.8742
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told meit was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy	228.3811
it was a mixed mass of blue red and gold	52.2724

books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hungerthat is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be	64.8729
happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone	114.9774
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	272.6425
haydée is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity only think then	332.4110
if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called clairemarieeugénie had been named mademoiselle chastitymodestyinnocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression	113.4256
on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them	125.4126
i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it	243.4038
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand	119.3135
well i am come to ask a favor of you of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his part ah my dear sir whatafter the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing	95.0324
i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m	122.9267
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all alberts establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the counts _chasseur_ also	292.3886
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother but you may have excited jealousy	125.8053
for you told me your father desired the marriage it is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union	151.4903

some voices even added long live the marshal but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet	243.1581
he had friends then after five years in prison	166.5413
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	160.0264
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv	123.9110
well monsieur laporte placed her near her majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence abandoned as she is by the king watched as she is by the cardinal betrayed as she is by everybody ah ah it begins to develop itself said dartagnan	125.2977
i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin but but but he must make me a baron zounds said dartagnan thats settled already i will be responsible for the barony on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the castle	203.2898
i will shape it out for you with my knife and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible	110.0005
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment	208.3096
on the other hand mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded	483.5853
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	53.8639
in two or three hours thought dantès the turnkey will enter my chamber find the body of my poor friend recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm	178.1868
go he said go my child edward ran out	156.4036
my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern	100.5034
ah if we had you my friends with you dartagnan with you porthosall four reunited for the first time for twenty yearswe would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together and did you promise the queen resumed dartagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation	176.6655
and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell	119.8835
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud	164.5459
i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment	50.8428
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect	124.1752
but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir	355.6459
i stretched out my arms	103.7452
where were they taken asked athos	96.0715
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me	197.7363
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble	188.0543
they have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed i think i know him who is he remember that i affirm nothing monsieur the commissary and that i only suspect whom do you suspect	70.7877
madame de saintméran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m	51.4579
de tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no harm	137.7299
from whom asked the gascon	87.5055
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan	49.7559
bravo and you are not afraid of that athos no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest and with regard to the past asked porthos	74.1801
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his pockets	76.0989
it seems a likely story to me and to me too besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain	177.6927
he had assigned himself the task of saving a mans life that day chance caused that man to be myself	196.2134
but suggested dartagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here mouston cried porthos	135.8621
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach london with the king	67.0139
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand	63.6526
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	79.1735
not at all said dartagnan	38.8250
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard	79.4902
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving	97.6477
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under dartagnans arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself	163.7614
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m	107.0023
come said dartagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing dartagnan what is to be done	45.7233
i require the proof of a preengagement	145.5163
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces and what will she do now asked the young man	102.1293
my dear friend cried aramis	11.4909
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him francs for a mouthful of bread	142.8406
there to his great astonishment dartagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into	194.9240
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawingroom	142.5325

it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part	100.3921
morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened	160.3520

it is not courage that is needed it is prudence and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave dartagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos	79.0785
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	132.5705
monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbé busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation	82.6203
in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities	294.6427

there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice _altisimâ voce_	322.9071
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	169.7116
asmodeusthat diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiecewould have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saintgermaindesprés while debray was casting up his figures	134.1633
at this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks	110.9922
and i too edmondoh believe meguilty as i wasoh yes i too have suffered much have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon	115.0956
no interrupted mercédès but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain a sob	65.0019
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	137.9008
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me shall you not go with the queen no replied mazarin	68.7714

waterjug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs	68.3873
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his fathers faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very	360.1199
moment of death	266.7824

aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in haste	134.7273

no false modesty take the best horse you can find	264.0242
on his side however great franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it	134.5155

but what do you think of the music what music why the music you have been listening to oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of	164.8488
paradise m you are right in some degree when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep then sleep here my dear count	160.0192

cardinal will end by accusing me	619.9730
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor	142.4556

the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows	192.2819

half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the	114.1384

milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	81.2847
you see said athos	22.1622
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it not at all ah that gives me more confidence this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascons soul	163.8170
ah traitor muttered dartagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix	137.7510
now then what do you say to that alas my dear planchet said dartagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me	73.1629

in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable	250.9125

dantès cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven	172.1822
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their hearts content	164.7736
none on my word i saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me thats all but since you believe i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may and danglars rose as if he meant to depart	104.3742
you have been to sea yes i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands what of that	90.2167

these two men were the executioners assistants	84.8808
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simarthe gorgeous robe of officeand the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the antechambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landingplace have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered	229.9080

franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us	217.5181
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar sausages athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person	151.8290
the juncture was favorable	507.8470
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior	106.8709
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkeys visits	187.3541
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table	168.3087
a million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep	170.7873
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	187.2241
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos	178.2403
the most amusing and the best informed of guides	230.5285
will your eminence please read and examine i am acquainted with it sign it then reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given suppose i refuse then said dartagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal would you dare	283.5001
to touch a cardinal you have dared my lord to imprison her majestys musketeers the queen will revenge me gentlemen i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis	112.4027

well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable then you have some other motive unknown to us athos smiled and dartagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying	147.2775
with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head	136.4970
what is it listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbés two hidingplaces	158.5691

to save yourselves to scamper away to fleethat is good for the kings musketeers porthos and aramis trembled with rage	117.9703
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself yes ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty i have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	80.7681
and sincei do not give it said the musketeer	66.8132
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended	284.7055
that door is guarded dartagnan you know that very well you will force it said porthos	95.8459
athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted	65.5007
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	106.3162
i have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses	47.6815
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	74.8543
listen i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you morrel your fathers son shall not die today and monte cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step	92.1596

he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the _âme damnée_ of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like a ninny as he is a ninny indeed said porthos but is the matter certain i had it from aramis replied the musketeer	177.6257
these keys were given up to him instantly	79.4425
i am repulsed on all sides what it is so indeed mademoiselle eugénie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle darmilly her confidant does not speak to me at all but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo	112.9346
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg works	68.1077

forgotten something you really wish to see her it is indispensable my lord mazarin hesitated for one instant but dartagnan was firm	108.3286
you see we were quite right to pacify that country yes but don carlos well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning well	167.2228

the young counts conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long	307.5490
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hopeher only means of safety	166.7199
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival	352.9215
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care	48.5643
d february this is capital said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on they rode forward and reached abbeville	135.4838

splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room	176.6592
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis dartagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m	136.6458

la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted	95.9726
dartagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity	492.1251
villefort had never been so concise and eloquent	122.2586
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynxs eyes the very depths of his heart	81.0662
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i ami am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it	134.6561
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated	82.6674
athos examined it and became very pale	89.0899
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for	109.4182
it was only a precaution	35.8867
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too	57.5192
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	440.6938
from whom is this said he eagerly	95.5475
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money full dress said the major half aloud	75.6345
i will make planchet brush my boots and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate	115.0863
albert ran to fetch a carriage	51.0242
he no longer feared realities but phantoms	913.5224
i will not abandon buckingham thus	330.9560
what think you of it inquired athos	133.3810
theres not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel but asked the sailor where are your companions	91.2928
but my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of me	125.7883
dartagnan ran out and returned directly after	158.7979
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dogs trick or other and that immediately said tréville	147.8608
debray said châteaurenaud	61.1692
dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	158.0002
but as m	143.7434
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m	106.6680
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could	68.4992
i will ask the cardinal it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was	64.7394
he or i	1504.5820
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man father i will said maximilian	197.8456
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired	110.8099
you do not understand asked felton	36.0383
private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business be easy on that score m	130.2751
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed	81.9422
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at tréport i felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of me possibly said monte cristo i have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire i was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge m indeed pray tell me how it happened willingly	213.6741
during this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats	137.9925
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition	95.5043
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed	152.8190
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage	184.8177
in the meantime i remain here	53.1948
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly	136.1948
what would the patron think	213.4538
albert at this moment ran in	65.4056
no one has seen dartagnan and porthos has not appeared	67.8003
she has met mademoiselle de villefort and has taken her arm see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis	154.2877
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep	132.9109
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and reentered the house	87.1502
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes good he accepts said monte cristo	85.4948
why the good god sends him back again caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair	180.4730
athos invited dartagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine oclock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve	94.6644
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage posthorses to travel either way a passport was necessary	208.2099
coquenard gently advised him to be patient	160.8606
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common everyday sort of attachment such as ours	214.6404
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor	172.3254
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	124.3642
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a womans nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love	176.1160
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door	25.2449
the cab crossed the pontneuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pasperdus	107.3378
mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber	65.7421
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition	170.5016
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor	105.0563
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living	86.8372
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden the earth black as soot the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed	133.9047
a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin	229.6557
egad no	178.9919
to join the army under the prince count and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy	85.4539
_corbleu_ i am more your friend than you thinkfor after our very first encounter i could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any malice	332.5324
de boville despairingly	1201.0591
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round	26.4053
dartagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but dartagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it	98.1276
as for myself as soon as i recovered my senses i went to monsieur the governor to whom i related all that had passed and asked what i should do with my prisoner	61.1553
ah this letter gives me an ideaa capital idea ah dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship _pharaon_ then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried	186.7638
one fine morning the king commanded m	157.7753
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt	170.7950
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him asked aramis	42.2102
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar	78.5241
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later mazarin coughed a little	176.4598
why really the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain yourself i must refer again to the club in the rue saintjacques it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police	151.7212
chapter	nan
his eyes remained open and menacing	87.5537
bernouin introduced him	112.5075
why much the same story but how could a poor catalan fisherboy without education or resources make a fortune	269.2805
there said dartagnan this is capital now let me try on the dress of yonder chap	134.1990
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation	70.8202
dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament impossible and executed in our presence what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me monsieur de flamarens yes he has just gone out athos smiled	143.7982
_la jeune amélie_ had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible	122.4394
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money	135.0201
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	964.5270
she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity	273.2285
my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence	76.1438
in a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man	100.3999
you ask but one thingand that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling	80.9039
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	54.3622
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy	60.6783
like a philosopher danglars returned at this moment alone	101.4182
andrea extended his hand bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money	87.5271
it is true i fought with tolerable success i dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others dartagnan pretended astonishment	279.3925
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a _priedieu_ all its furniture	230.9092
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you dearest valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet i cannot	99.8018
find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you	118.2016
i obey my captains orders	1008.8226
noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	237.6587
come i am a good sort of a prince added he and although i like not puritans i do them justice and it is the same with puritanesses when they are pretty	123.3192
what planchet is monsieur dartagnan here here i am my friend dear athos cried dartagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation	71.4103
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear	82.1133
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting pistols then at eight oclock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being	132.2045
bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabriai have sailed two months in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered thats all yes and your conversation is most interesting	136.8555
and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for monte cristo the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage	108.4338
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out tonight for paris eh cried the young man turning pale	64.1880
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he	195.6186
prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	51.9061
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch	165.8015
gods blood cried the officer have they killed him	103.1975
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of dartagnan and of athos it must be the best but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison egad cried dartagnan hes just the man i count upon	88.2795
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family affair	1098.8011
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by dartagnan and porthos	68.1308
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man	74.6603
de blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war fortunately sire said m	71.8348
bonacieux we shall hear no more on the contrary said dartagnan we shall hear better dartagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to mme	85.4319
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant servicea costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined	217.0651
he will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memoryand this surely is not vanity but a justifiable prideit is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others	137.1006
i have struck myself	64.2437
but said the count so great was ali pashas confidence that on his deathbed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a	101.7861

they were rapidly leaving the château dif behind	98.4972

we will embark for algiers for england for america or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to paris when our friends have reconciled your family valentine shook her head	127.4559
at one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off	259.2613
there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart	215.4559
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us but this fire continued franz	90.5124
yes i and why _you_ because i alone know what that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears indeed said milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for i really cannot tell what you mean and she looked at dartagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away	132.1161
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets	144.2696

cavalcanti albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristos eye was on him	141.2494
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner	162.8996
what is this light asked he	46.6327

they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy	110.0642
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	121.8544
why on board the tartan replied the sailor	168.9657
well his love is half real half fanciful	1065.0957
i depend upon you to escort me home	70.3948
i recognize you perfectly the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion	190.3905
de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him	90.7109
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo _pardieu_ everyone exists doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses have you seen the greek	184.0066

tis a long time since i saw thee come come dartagnan said athos do not affect to be strongminded there are tears in your eyes	89.5627
you are insane monsieur monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting and dartagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to dartagnan to serve him as a safeguard	112.1458
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as dartagnan had so often done formerly	165.8488
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me bah exclaimed monte cristo thats a fine reason to give	46.7144

the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely	207.0367
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	104.9583

mazarin was a cheat at the cardtable	154.4963
faith that would be a far better life than i lead now but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch who wont dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house	154.9543
dartagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the night	174.6895
knocked on the head	24.1141
andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawingroom and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously	57.0228
a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated	98.1148
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious	42.5072
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely	275.3726
presently they heard milady retire to her room	219.3474
in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted	73.2166
man to make a journey to london for her	51.1945
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway	181.5063
her ladiesthat is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sensehad just brought into her dressingroom the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	133.8182

you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely	80.5904

the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition	148.6703
he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii	186.8731
bravo i am ready	18.0907
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmonds time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them	141.9332
what cried dartagnan	66.3711
i demand the suppression of the thesis since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably	219.7103
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of	111.2472
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again	64.7046
i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs yes almost said aramis	178.1891
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him	48.7820
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed	141.4187
ah yes we burn as they say at the game of pincette	172.3988
i bought it from him but it belongs to dartagnan	90.2562
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind	94.9831
dessessart ought to be his passport	126.3407
this time maximilian was the first to arrive	50.2328
i am like nero_cupitor impossibilium_ and that is what is amusing you at this moment	90.1682
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day	45.1411
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the _concierges_ door and which merits a particular description	251.4913
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ringtrue said my mother	62.9758
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night	71.9170
before	nan
but why have two of each sort asked danglars	250.1609
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	140.6050
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	90.9613
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian	86.0198
monsieur dartagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rentand even better on that account ought i to know him	125.1909
the glance was of sublime eloquence	810.6427
their masters are dead i thought they might be useful so i took them meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols	156.6270
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort	110.2042
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration	191.9023
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath	193.5282
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord i merely await your commands good it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain liar thought dartagnan	262.6191
what i hate today i adore tomorrow and vice versa	1066.3641
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m	382.3055
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa	391.4162
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a sideglance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is prettyi think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow	142.7637
you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing	92.7221
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldnt surprise me at all perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us nonsense he had us in his power	78.6924
and he let us go	21.5299
sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london	80.6310
madame said albert allow me to present to you m	40.0091
had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo i must believe on seeing you caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven	85.6099
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m	73.0021
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order	61.9316
night came and at ten oclock they anchored	44.3403
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise	124.0299
it is well known how violent the kings prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men	209.4791
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his eye was calm and even brilliant	96.9574
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne	240.8875
ah deuce take it we have a precious fellow here monsieur grimaud said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the reach of my fist hush hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord	118.7890
i have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts what a rope ladder yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes cant be sent around a ball like a letter no but it may be sent in something else in something elsein something else	140.1781
dartagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	114.7095
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward the money you desire shall be at your house by ten oclock tomorrow morning my dear count replied danglars	69.4432
the poor girl under the caresses of dartagnan lifted her head	89.5782
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat	112.6776
one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree	107.7455
the valet ran directly	1100.5095
if i ever find him againand i will find him i swear were it in hell he was waiting for a woman continued tréville	99.0952
m	nan
look here i was trying on my wedding suit	302.7336
a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet	98.2785
dartagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence	72.5971
m see here exclaimed caderousse	275.2563
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	16.5302
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo reentered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan	218.6144
the scotchman	6464.3291

de tréville captain of the kings musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis	70.6425
she saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass	90.5417
this time dartagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was	94.5644
i have known persons he continuedfor he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of dartagnanwho by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made	266.4125
the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward	147.0564
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread	68.9762
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and dartagnan sword in hand rushed into the	113.3967
rooms of m	78.8045
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day all	115.3583
day yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box you know him then yes and no how so it is a long story tell it to me it would frighten you too much so much the more reason at least wait until the story has a conclusion very	98.9964

then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord	85.6659
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coachhouses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who	161.7933
spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters	128.5588
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy	147.7527
oh how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete	144.0151
i think i hear a noise she said leave me goodbye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girls heart was filled with gratitude	95.0363
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself	237.9671
louis xviii	4.2327
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet	128.8425
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room	154.6264
what blows what blood he fainted	2004.7417
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti	67.1327
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali a horse for m	117.8062
my friend said aramis if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you ah said dartagnan is that the way you return to your apartment after nine at night pardieu said aramis the rule of the convent is very severe pardon me my dear friend said dartagnan i think you said pardieu do you think so said aramis smiling it	67.9481

afraid of making any inquiries at this house dartagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	62.4818
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina	501.4350
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the infanta for king charles i who was then only prince of wales	166.0034
a woman could go up a ladder like that aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but dartagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity	116.4216
and if i have any counsel to give it is always lose she seemed to love me so she _seemed_ did she oh she _did_ love me you child why there is not a man who has not believed as you do that his mistress loved him and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress except you	98.2671
athos who never had one thats true said athos after a moments silence thats true i never had one let us drink but then philosopher that you are said dartagnan instruct me support me	107.5835

rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution	279.0597
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table	106.3639
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	119.0254
if they had discovered miladys retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends	90.7145
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber	150.0321
well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany he is rich then i believe so but that ought to be visible that is what deceives you debray i do not understand you have you read the _arabian nights_ what a question well	129.6661

she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughters innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof	312.5677
she undertook his seduction and succeeded she would have seduced a saint	332.9221
the _soubrette_ said for your master i have no other master but you soa pretty little lass my faith is that _soubrette_ dartagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest	159.2535
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friends susceptibility	63.3767
after this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave	99.0845
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me	95.5060
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discoveredthat is a roulette where he wins	168.1992
without playing and is no loser when he loses the baroness became enraged	510.2652
yes that you sent me we sent you wine you know very wellthe wine from the hills of anjou yes i know what brand you are talking about the wine you prefer well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou wine said porthos	145.9238
deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing	98.6596
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man	63.2540
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	218.2573
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him	162.4418
no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word and who thus designated it the king himself the king i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics	104.0808
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone	149.4268
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows	175.3923
the rabbit died	2841.4580
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested what will they dare to arrest a man in his majestys service _pardieu_ they did not scruple much in the case of athos	107.0575
when the soldier saluted charles athoss heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket	297.7528
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm and you should call it devotion added	198.3077
aramis the vineyard of selfsacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master chevalier said dartagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldnt you especially after two or three days of fasting oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois we havent known him so long one may readily conceive that during these jokes which	224.7131
were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent	131.8808
he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome	76.6428
i was there too and i never shall forget the old mans smile at this prescription	165.0491
jacopo will carry you to leghorn where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar	206.0069
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare	100.4757
seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hands	201.2668
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him	87.5482
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed	133.6319
himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris	100.0341
what were you doing on that armchair asked he	56.5953
dantès saluted villefort and retired	323.5002
we will judge you in spite of your silence	49.2516
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease	58.7968
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too	135.9882
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required	160.8191
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen	550.6874
danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell	32.6683
my first visit was to the thicket	118.6118
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body	215.2681
the devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf man it was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but youhow did you get rid of yours oh mine replied dartagnan was not a man what was it then it was an apparition and i charmed it away without further explanation dartagnan took the pistols which were	124.5234
upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the richelieu gate	88.9747
dartagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the sheath	48.0577
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	91.9778
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where dartagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle	133.3280
villainous host cried he he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no better yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago	212.9146
by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal what by demanding my head of the cardinal cried dartagnan pale with terror	119.4709
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for threefourths of that city known as the capital of the world	140.8032
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	96.6286
whom does this belong to he inquired	193.1561
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	147.4286
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature	126.6095
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris	102.8871
but with his simple musketeers uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank	181.6496
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewelbox so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left	129.3302
he pressed the counts hand and left	48.1524
porthos kill every one who stands in your way and after pressing the hand of athos dartagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist	105.2591
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon capitalnothing replied mercédès with a mournful smile	125.6601
i cant leave you alone in this abominable country thanks my worthy friend	170.4407
you are right it is not you who should apprise m	82.1944
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end horrible ejaculated the priest	79.1668
what the devil did you come to such a country for athos	51.6714
the world is not wanting in attractions	155.1667
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other recommendation	132.6312
how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling	333.4394
speak my friend i listen there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear oh yes	133.5608
yes exclaimed dantès and i tell you that i will save you yet well then try	52.1510
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping	413.5084
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly	99.5610

the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished	68.5981

almost immediately bazin came downstairs	693.2590
constance replied the young man where are you	13.9069
he is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody	171.8241
you only know that this money exists	150.9590
born in the neighborhood of arles she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue	199.9288
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	263.0512
truly she might have thought of you at home i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her touching sympathy so you hate each other said the count	63.4938
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe	127.9680
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count	90.1852
at length m	69.5835
well you are right it is more difficult than i thought	27.4273
to grief succeeded rage	15800.8057
the comte de la fere cannot be far off only the doors are locked that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for gods sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve	179.6494
it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing	125.4289
listen captain baldi theres one way of settling this said jacopo	1095.8872
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door	36.5865
hold see the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands wait wait said the duke	180.0498
at this moment the door of the ministers box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	65.8550
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for gods sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us	98.4890
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape simply the fact that the idea never occurred	148.8593
to me answered dantès	170.5894
dartagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy	16.2548
do you call him nebuchadnezzar said mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is charles the first the king the good king charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him	103.3214
did you ever see her furious no said athos	91.0465
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	325.9690
yes i understand said valentine it is because you love me the old man assented	40.1563
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers	261.9519
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested dartagnans permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon	125.4989
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek	66.0784
good thought dartagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable	98.1687
morrel i didnt dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is	83.7644
falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you how singular murmured maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrarywhat strange feelings are aroused by politics hush cried valentine suddenly someone is coming maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most	253.5761
ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it	229.9779
chapter lxii	52.7275
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man	78.0512
when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the _festa_ indoors he took teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of sanfelice i thought replied the young	121.3591
girl with all the frankness of her nature that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore and what said your cavalier to you he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say he was right said luigi	105.3366
but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point anne blushed and buried her face in her hands	137.1182
well if so why do you object to my doing so i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious thing and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection did he reflect before he insulted my father if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied	91.6932
ah my dear count you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting	54.6439
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor	483.9848
it was m	62.7886
cries of live the king live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions	151.5522
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that dartagnan had not come to béthune	56.9231
have i travelled in that country	134.9514
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather sharply	669.9868
overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even criminalbut live count i have your word said morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added it is halfpast eleven morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own	174.2977
sake but for yours and he arose	130.8416
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and tomorrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier	129.9359
he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense	347.6817
stop he said there he is at his post gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand	88.7095
ah the kings musketeers are arrested by the guards of the cardinal are they continued m	49.1391
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each	180.7895
in all probability this time his master would not retract	71.0269
héloïse de villefort	33.0720
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given dartagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	103.4861
villeforts only answer was a stifled groan	308.1129
monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine planchet from head to foot	262.6610
the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation the duke put his pen to the paper	142.0338
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence	199.5621
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	107.7785
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which twothirds were already filled and affixed his seal	199.2679
for example an english prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of malmsey	141.6946
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès	124.1177
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good will	153.0338
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself	181.3376
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied	74.2767
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor	159.6404
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one i admit but very necessaryhave you any money something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought	189.7818
to leave fifty for raoula young man must live respectably	616.7744
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of châteaurenaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence	161.2734
and me too said porthos	133.3266
i am not an abbé i am not mad perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not	43.8435
give me anything you like it is of little consequence go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints	181.4318
come answer frankly _ma foi_ no returned albert	387.9198
m	nan
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant	220.4242
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the selfsatisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond	135.9474
the day on which dartagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province	365.0125
but this is infamous cried he	147.2013
good caderousse he said how happy you will be i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife	92.8683
ah my dear replied dartagnan upon that very horse i came to paris what does monsieur know this horse said mousqueton	93.7067
athos walked about in a contemplative mood	195.2850
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strongminded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears	142.4870
it wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward enjoining in case of disobedience on his part	118.4044
all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him	66.8338
i depend on you	72.8116
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth	117.1496
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemeni was afraid you were dangerously ill the two men in black who guessed dartagnans meaning darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening but dartagnan took no heed of it	216.3588
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him	68.6409
oh yes but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover	106.6534
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards theres no use in thinking any more about athos	167.9558
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words october it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse	147.7923
my dear fellow i think we should ask you that question you know such news much better than we do	51.3539
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon	73.7092
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet	274.6711
barrois said valentine my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a secret spring in it which you knowwill you open it barrois looked at the old man	90.8580
this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as i think you told me dartagnan yes i know him very well and i also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterinlaw there is no harm in that	91.2314
i thank you for having recognized me sir debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor	121.6312
thank you she said	15.0979
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his masters guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill dartagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of dartagnan	117.1783
or rather of planchet after dartagnan had saved his life	148.9070
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by dartagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to dartagnan that he should marry her	197.9326
on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter dear wifewe have now reached the moment of decision	213.8076
bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at st cloud and not elsewhere before the destréess pavilion and not in another street	108.4734
ah sir replied caderousse we cannot console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me	81.3504
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters	47.4223
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose	64.4730
dear lady said mme	122.9753
pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little this evening you said well this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile	164.4323
madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke	70.4310
which he thought he alone could comprehend	103.3631
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removedthe same which is there now on the table oh dear mother it was a dream so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell but when i did so the shade disappeared my	101.8368
maid then entered with a light but she saw no one phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them	86.1556
sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper and how did this despatch reach you inquired the king	124.8775
a circle was immediately formed around the door	84.4927
my faith replied dartagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward dartagnan stood quite astonished	105.3157
to arms cried grimaud	606.6325
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my huntingknife	339.6165
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous	82.4730
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours	171.0188
i am taken shouted athos with all the power of his lungs	67.0639
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy some i shall displease others	258.8445
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thinga shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with earrings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies	270.1043

she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself you have been free to choose	137.8734
your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze	121.1536
every evening he shuts himself in there	128.7230
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the _thousand and one nights_ and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto	80.1681
you can see it in his eye	62.7998
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that	60.5647
strange athos was scarcely aged at all his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever	357.4040
are you also in accord with spain and england with madame de chevreuse and the queen sire replied the cardinal sighing i believed myself secure from such a suspicion monsieur cardinal you have heard me i will have those letters there is but one way what is that that would be to charge monsieur de séguier the keeper of the seals with this	104.2487

his drawingroom under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the wellregulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained	334.7291
he hastened to open the _secrétaire_ and found the pocketbook in the drawer and in it the letter of credit	79.8490
ah this is something new replied the king	70.4437

to be natural you think so i am sure of it	32.5617
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass it had disappeared	98.5266

two hours passed away	13.5887
there remained in the bankers house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise darmilly	138.2086
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse	33.6511
the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screwdriver to take them off	136.6598

franz thanked the count for his attention	53.8981
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one	230.5361
this is the order he said	39.7352
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain	195.1617

the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting	183.8995
adieu thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him	88.5760

his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer	50.7959
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile	150.6381
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	135.1830
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead	100.8128

from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil	150.8135
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children	160.6624
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer	87.1804
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count	185.3008
if you want anything you can ring oh my god my god how i have suffered said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy	96.5551
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	158.0899
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	466.6125

snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nighttheneven then mercédès you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude	127.1086
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellowthe true type of a duenna or a devotee	271.1708
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him	70.5772
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing	145.6646
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol	71.6273
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table	105.6833
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts	121.3610

he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent	234.2779

the visitor was about fiftytwo years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe	125.6337
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity	42.8436

i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody i agree monsieur but do not be too confident	92.6112
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château dif and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects	165.5825
what do you wish gentlemen who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone	38.6930
m monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of commandcourage haydée dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pashait was a friend	107.0913

oh oh said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me	167.5296
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board	64.3157
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andreas attentions in order to get rid of morcerf but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him	227.1903
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak	78.0639
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saintjacques	105.0298
olivain he exclaimed what do i see below there a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded	175.7249
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded	343.1629
ah here is one of them i believe in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared	70.1795

her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him	139.2558
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majestya dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son	131.3869
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister	156.7996
it is he said she	16.4260
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	170.9328
i do not allude to you my boy	24.3805
now i belong to this lastnamed class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain	260.1562
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high	42.0700
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitants shoulder	82.9148
eventually she was obliged to leave france	38.0996

imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen a don quixote without his corselet without his coat of mail without his cuisses a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure face long and brown high cheek bones a sign of sagacity the maxillary muscles	277.6509
enormously developed an infallible sign by which a gascon may always be detected even without his capand our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather the eye open and intelligent the nose hooked but finely chiseled	244.9249
his company was on guard at the louvre he was at the louvre with his company	27.9633
dartagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it	116.7919
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed	98.9546
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can	108.2242
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name and therefore said dartagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé dherblay	95.1199
i killed the duke of buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain i have punished him for his injustice that is all de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility	211.7268
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return wellwe will settle our account ah monseigneur cried dartagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure	139.1649
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you but from whom is that letter oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding _grisette_ from madame de chevreuses chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper	158.7715
and sealed her letter with a duchesss coronet what do you say hold i must have lost it said the young man maliciously pretending to search for it	99.0371
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud	222.4113
sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour half an hours rest is enough replied the gascon	124.5066
now madame said debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still francs the interest of this money in my hands but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest excuse me madame said debray coldly i had your permission to do so and i have made use of it	86.0900
oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees	156.6396
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris	82.0384
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès	202.5217
to saddle gentlemen to saddle let us pursue him and we shall overtake him my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him	81.8164
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	56.5427
but said caderousse again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed you must pay for ityou understand well what do you want i think that with a hundred francs a month well i could live upon a hundred francs comeyou understand me but that with with with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy here are two hundred	100.2363
said andrea and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of caderousse	284.2852
you will have to find the abbé busoni and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare	242.3128
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied	182.5300
well said cucumetto have you executed your commission yes captain returned carlini	450.5824
a gendarme was crossing the court	95.5902
bertuccios forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachmanrue de la fontaine no no was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage	136.0933
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual	225.9494
you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion	194.3322
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	91.9391
but what were you to do with that woman asked dartagnan with anguish	30.1378
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with all sir have you the keys they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions very well and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which	62.1340
said i have no further need of you you may go but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken it is only fifty thousand francs everything included and your fee is included in this sum but have you not come from auteuil here yes certainly well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of	93.9091
time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal	162.9929
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad	51.6393
oh said dantès timidly what is the matter villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter	60.5870
the mob dispersed	4230.5337
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	154.7260
it was the count de rochefort	21.8175
troops five or six thousand men courage plenty then the thing is easy	228.5381
the more so sir as it was mens and not gods doing tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything	133.9511
who sends you no one how did you know i was in prison i recognized you some time since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champsélysées oh the champsélysées	105.3621
ah there he is calling me now	145.4519
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friendyou can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction	98.2691
barcelona has risen in his favor all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stockjobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow	90.5202
you will have pity on me ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask	65.5166
chapter xxi	51.2103
it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when dartagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation	87.5677
the insult at the bankers door beauchamp stopped morcerf	444.8187
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes planchet began to sing un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin je crois quil gronde contre le mazarin	873.0482
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron what is monsieur voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore what is the matter with him he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen	112.0017
ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die is he then so ill dear voiture asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain	165.4419
therefore in spite of olivains remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him	111.9622
morrel	nan
dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was guarded	85.1703
have you answered the question i put to you on entering the roomwhere do you keep the poison you generally use madame madame de villefort raised her arms to heaven and convulsively struck one hand against the other	82.3741
go to go to i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself	93.1661
mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may appear yes sir returned julie	174.8585
what is it you want dear grandpapa said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud thenfinding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant _no_she said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to	116.3716
another she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n	272.1661
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst dartagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully	249.9153
chapter xlv	65.9167
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	118.5708
coquenard the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres	353.6690
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes	47.2777
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his sidenot from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times	181.2464
sir said he here is monsieur dartagnans answer but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos	50.7283
well i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future soninlaw how would you set about it ah that would be easy enoughi would give her a lesson a lesson yes	127.9908
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it	435.2164
upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our timeit is precious	88.0006
here i am wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us why all these precautions you shall know milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	83.1389
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him	161.5688
do you think so sir certainly	33.6167
and what he continued has been done with the poor body by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it	197.9330
but he has wealth i believe already doubtless he has	168.2341
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last night dartagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents you saw your wi hush interrupted athos	108.1394
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to mehis name was fernand that of my betrothed wasstay stay continued the abbé i have forgotten what he called her mercédès said caderousse eagerly	148.5587
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil you have been to	82.3588
london was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger	153.2148
it was about eleven oclock at night	32.0288
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m	93.9876
well m	261.6523
no but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintancein your own country for instance my dear little love in my country the ladies do without chambermaids	140.8420
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird	41.9074
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then dartagnan tore open the envelope of the letter	84.9780
i too said the young man am a musicianat least my masters used to tell me so but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence then hoping doubtless to effect his purpose he saidthe prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday	190.3842
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her anger	55.6216
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbés meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a	120.3431
man could do in these days to his friends and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies	118.3301
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love	73.5107
do you not remember him yes said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air	110.7299
porthos alone made no reply	61.8912
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really cannot pretend to lament it	105.7750

where asked dartagnan	40.4989
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk	101.0192
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment	227.9074

whip vigorously to his horses	120.1931
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them	66.3940
zounds give way at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late	50.4394
of what must i repent stammered danglars	298.6906

more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame	223.9913
and trodden the path of glory	665.7566

tell me his name edmond dantès villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at fiveandtwenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch	222.6156
i wrote to franzand were he here he would confirm every wordi wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of	191.2211
the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said châteaurenaud	147.0484
_ma foi_ there is no hurry	27.2837
after you however said cromwell	277.3167
dartagnan of the kings guards company dessessart is expected at the palaiscardinal this evening at eight oclock	102.9144
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	176.7211
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriagecontract was going on	107.5051
the gascon and the italian	90.0426
albert was punctual	240.7377
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m	174.3590
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging mebesides i may not be there myself where at your ball why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that purpose you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you one	95.2522
thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments tell me what it is my mother begs you to come the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting	73.3231
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain	306.1536
i am called said andrea	71.3542
at last dartagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing	110.3084
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage	159.9960
with fortyfive thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four but before six monthsyou with your music and i with my voicewe shall double our capital	266.1524

i who have a seraglio at cairo one at smyrna and one at constantinople preside at a weddingnever then you refuse me decidedly and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way but what must be done said andrea disappointed	136.4975

and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your boarders said milady oh my god poor woman i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	112.6992
all villeforts influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dantès had so nearly divulged	429.2909
still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was well ah now i think of it the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the hall said beauchamp	47.9989
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha it is true nevertheless then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated how so yes	121.5887
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein	658.1418
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from	103.4586
school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother	140.7269
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires to this athos replied quietly we also have money leftfor i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs	190.6134
she looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at dartagnan with an air which said you are very amiable no doubt but you would be _charming_ if you would only depart dartagnan rose and took his hat milady gave him her hand to kiss	68.1895
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	96.6077
you know something of that as well as i do i think	29.5501
silence said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you came but where and when shall i see you again cried dartagnan	58.5358
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which dartagnan bowed as a sign that he listened	43.4827
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their beds of dried leaves or wolfskins at the back of the chamber now arose	146.2129
the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading _cæsars commentaries_ and by danglars studying the _life of alexander_	170.7793
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him	130.5618
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty and she had signed it	112.4068
danglars in promoting a new railway line you m	538.4357
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the fact is i have gained francs by the sale of them	197.3946
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	176.3683
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and châteaurenaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back	116.3528
bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon	130.8698
the three friends burst into laughter	131.8241
my sister how did your husband die horror cried porthos and aramis	214.2710
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun	259.9604
the chateau he said to himself what chateau	238.4057
but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the _pharaon_ where m	83.0446
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximiliantoo rich	99.1481
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case	175.7358
but how did this horse come into your hands mousqueton pray said the lackey say nothing about it monsieur it is a frightful trick of the husband of our duchess how is that mousqueton why we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of quality the duchesse debut your pardon my master has commanded me to be discreet	179.7538
he repaired then instantly to the office of the _lieutenantcriminel_	126.3395
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself then replied dartagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fairhaired head by me and though hes but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining	116.6540
and encouraging me the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes	82.6757
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards	53.0890
she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed	100.3325
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve you serve the cardinal yes madame and as his servant i will	102.2651
not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart	74.0351
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de châteaurenaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf	61.3008
it was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died and what did you do then what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	47.0816
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he	121.8808
had been kneeling when m	297.5737
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain	2895.6597
the two men were left alone	34.4168
well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing them impossible cried the king the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain lord leven are	138.5479
you certain of it sir i heard it with my own ears the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands	81.9445
ive a great desire to drink the kings health said athos	61.6341
liked a pleasant jest	1059.5995
the house as i said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see andrea drew the garden the court and the house	94.2195
noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that	153.6190
he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villeforts words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain	85.3763
and this conviction restored his strength	370.1185
aramis bit his lips till the blood came	107.3401
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol	97.6051
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yoursof your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to blaspheme	187.9993
but i cursed my father	89.9082
he looked around him and saw mme	26.0691
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	212.1408
barrois said the doctor can you speak barrois muttered a few unintelligible words	187.7000
no for your skill with the sword is so well known ahwho has betrayed me the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered and you failed they positively refused morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol never well we have time look monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace	170.7574
of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club	269.5697
whats your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de luniversite	125.1231
ho ho exclaimed dartagnan picking up a louis and displaying it heres a louis that smells confoundedly of straw mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gaycome along mousqueton	207.8910
instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it	482.5980
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving dartagnans composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what	103.4945
will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you cannot pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at	67.5592
the musketeer with admiration	247.3425
the blood had mounted to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis	63.7827
m	nan
i informed my superiors that i did not feel myself sufficiently prepared for ordination and at my request the ceremony was postponed for a year	108.5210
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening	121.3310
and madame de villefort to my countryhouse at auteuil	82.4878
a circle was formed around them	163.6621
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege	195.3528
and yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so on ones deathbed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with ones own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes	198.2005
indemnity you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation the trademark owner any agent or employee of the foundation anyone providing copies of project gutenberg electronic works in accordance with this agreement and any volunteers associated with the production promotion and distribution of project gutenberg electronic works harmless from all liability costs and expenses including legal fees that arise directly or indirectly from	39.8257

he repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be announced	114.8750
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	77.0920
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m	97.7086
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dantès paused with anguish on his brow	133.6473
then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman like athos the second a good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abbé like aramis	190.1917
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos	108.5474
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done sire replied m	169.0616
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed	129.0928
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris	53.1548
one believes readily what he wishes to believe	324.2585
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m	130.3561
anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity	83.8864
explain yourself grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole	82.9113
your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men	100.9875
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything villeforts astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary	335.0924
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed	308.9957
he had his foot upon it that is all and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation	125.6371
the countenance of old dantès brightened	422.3849
the countess de winter chapter xxii	60.2439
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon	80.4124
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking	112.5476
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	98.7473
dartagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a comrade	90.8782
franz looked upthey were opposite the rospoli palace	251.9895
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt	194.7466
now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties	194.7600
adieu madame in saying these words dartagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved	131.1031
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster	142.6813
you cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger	191.4951
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord	68.0538
what do i want	23.9792
he took monte cristo aside	143.8455
that happened as i told you in	37.6667
well asked dartagnan	20.5654
the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination	309.9679
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse	282.1675
come recover the procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale	148.1756
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistolsone in front of porthos and the other of dartagnan	106.1500
will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family what is it said beauchamp much surprised surely you must be mistaken the story sent you from yanina yanina yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which	94.8106
brings me here such is really the case i assure you upon my honor baptiste give me yesterdays paper cried beauchamp	207.3479
that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil and came to my estate bracieux	122.5753
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand	140.2851
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with dartagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion	137.1993
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it	80.1076
it turned out as dartagnan had foreseen	108.9676
i will even venture to say that i am certain m	59.2129
well exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison	184.7816
in the first instance to marseilles madame to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	133.0731
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired	810.6523
yes it is i my unclei the son of miladyi the monki the secretary and friend of cromwelli know you now both you and your companions in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins	341.6442
the count of sanfelice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigis arm in a group of peasants	130.8200
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud i have brought you another said dartagnan	118.6076
silence dherblay cried athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these	183.7236
i have heard monsieur dartagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him speak monsieur speak said dartagnan who instinctively scented something advantageous	190.8380
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriagewheels as he was driven rapidly away	82.8678
there only then remained porthos and bicarat	294.7066
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city	97.0270
although about fortyfour or fortyfive years old she might have passed for thirtyfive	285.7498
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes	54.6781
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear dukeyou may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape	122.1215
which we are contriving	219.3149
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries	72.6473
he is dead and no mistake about it oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please so be it said the englishman	136.8998
i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars	81.1542
it is no nonsense it is quite true	47.3460
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault châteaurenaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yewtrees	185.6269
at that moment he cut it	52.6805
tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man	115.4986
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing	38.3213
he was occupied with the preparations for raouls departure and was seeking to gain time	76.3355
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father	118.1817
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation	62.2689
ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband guilty though he were	172.6171
their return was cheerful	552.0040
the priest stole the sacred vases and sold them but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested	134.0336
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades	58.8488
yes i am a man of honor said dartagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess itfor i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not	102.2623
make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps dartagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to miladys but she evaded him	149.1461
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each	178.7537
he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars	308.6873
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life	165.9075
the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body	235.0305
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king	129.1532
this feeling lasted but for a moment	183.5660
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table	73.0962
i will descend with my eyes shut have you confidence in me said felton	181.8760
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp	193.2742
you are acquainted with the scriptures dartagnan thought of the appointment mme	121.1926
yes	nan
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right dont be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal	192.3333
at the word _notary_ noirtier made a sign to her to stop	66.4232
no by your eminence by me	153.5437
no my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france what do you think of all this said athos in a low tone to dartagnan after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english	98.2142
come take a little oath for me on the cross i wont ask anything more of you on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth on the cross i swear to denounce you everywhere as a	168.9558
murderer as a thief of honor as a base coward on the cross i swear if i ever leave this place to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race beware said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard	146.2564
i will come and ask mine at eleven oclock this evening	63.2196
the wife of athos we have now to search for athos said dartagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue	98.0217
you cannot for a moment imagine dartagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted dartagnan	166.1224
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy	213.1819
art thou a messenger from god art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or a demon callest thou thyself eloa or astarte do you not know me felton	172.2596
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking itit was the noise of cannon	111.7437
oh what a dreadful event cried maximilian	248.4818
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglarsa small octagonalshaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin	257.0941
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so	50.9481
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m	236.8674
he perceived châteaurenaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeantatarms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done	75.6089
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony tonight about crushing an adder athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a basrelief	245.1072
now athos said dartagnan do you begin to believe that its a ruined cause and that what with your harrisons joyces bridges and cromwells we shall never get the upper hand the king will be delivered at the tribunal said athos the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work dartagnan shrugged his shoulders	154.2988
have you anything to ask of me	24.5222
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her	335.6734
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed	137.4252
do you find yourself badly lodged sister	373.0631

oh unfortunate creature monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault i swear what business had you then to go into the chamber of monsieur dartagnan your neighbor with whom you had a long conference during the day ah yes monsieur commissary yes that is true and i confess that i was in the wrong	72.4471
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals	138.3477
why does not he go about his business stupid fellow yourself said dartagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window	89.5363
the secret cave chapter	1468.7070
he began his day by breakfasting substantiallya bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body and about two oclock he had his two horses saddled and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la villete	203.7168
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us morrel swore to love him with all his soul and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god	87.1235
ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand	55.6231
i require honorable guaranties i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shedthat is our mutual guaranty	232.8768
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure	175.0651
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with	83.8741
his finger	792.8079

if it is written yonder in heaven that the duc de beaufort is to escape he will escape and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it mazarin started	70.5364
gentlemen thus dartagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him	139.9657
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors	129.6649
i must wait	105.1003
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us	354.8523
villefort had calculated rightly	737.5630
well you do not reply resumed mazarin	65.5476
he went on his way	27.7379
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothersfor you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhatyou alone are perfect no not perfect was the counts reply only impenetrable thats all	216.4597
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry true said andrea	99.3391
it was one of the gascons artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty	308.7255
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	215.0120
let us sit down to supper	30.0774
monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m	124.6775
the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbés ladder of cords	85.3560
captivity the first day chapter liii	32.2814
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure	120.7459
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of	232.0716
the islandsdaume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project	381.3307
then some words were spoken by the two women	84.8048
we have made our calculations with spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred livres four times fifteen makes sixtysix thousand livres said athos	181.7375
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	41.3922
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married her	57.9609
bonacieux	nan
suspicion instantly seized me	317.5258
i do not reject it altogether said athos but i wish to remind aramis that he cannot quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy that two hours after the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person	131.8337
will be arrested without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us gentlemen said dartagnan what porthos says is full of sense ah ah but whats going on in the city yonder said athos	123.0082
nonsense impossible said châteaurenaud only ten days after the flight of her daughter and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband debray colored slightly and followed with his eyes the direction of beauchamps glance	111.5405
do you know what has become of athos asked dartagnan of planchet as they galloped on	47.6859
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp	126.0882
your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam which she had from a bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart	136.7272
the man in the mask	59.3004
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	302.7291
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated th april in which morrel by the deputy procureurs advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the	208.1147
imperial causeservices which villeforts certificates rendered indisputable	1043.9233
trust me dont let us try to do things cheaply	85.9161
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monks dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages	159.1061
he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone	172.4840
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter	54.9800
they entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder	118.2863
the same evening some friends of mine visited mem	777.7710
i have resolved to fly with you not a wordbe ready	107.7045
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé	42.0215
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain	175.6528
what is he doing up there and they called châteaurenauds attention to him	130.7723
morrel i shall have his place	94.0854
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyones mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness	142.2054
an enemy in my house do you say edmond if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more fernands eye darted lightning	131.1425
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said	243.8693
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd well look	117.5916
through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here ah what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian	88.1441
cromwells letter	79.0785
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles	118.5155
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer	112.1755
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet	127.6501
when we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes	187.4488
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	46.0318
it was a pledge a remembrance	144.5802
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve oh oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me dartagnan bah perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome	125.1636
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos	72.8544
oh misery oh vanity you take it however yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle	215.6013
the latter smiled	250.1201
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak	229.9831
come sweep away all that for me shoulder muskets present arms aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that dartagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter	464.5997
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward	87.4629
de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair i have no objection replied m	71.8047
bonacieuxhe ran full of joy to seek his comrades whom he had left only half an hour before but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied	83.9638
where is my son asked villefort let him be removed from the house that he may not see master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet	72.9510
without you	221.9960
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber	113.5500
m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	165.2520
andrea was gone	66.9760
the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations	120.0400
both had recently come into the country	126.0767
they had understood each other without speaking	78.4445
ah said he you have remarked i must have been blind not to have seen yes said porthos that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church buried in this vile quarter solely for the sake	90.4565
of seeing me monsieur porthos said the procurators wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes	57.4057
for the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if porthos were still at the great st martin he would call for him on his way	63.3389
oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein	50.2197
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself ah ah can it be on account of the amours of madame de boistracy said dartagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as	74.7106
to court affairs	7725.7144
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together	88.1353
it struck ten	1480.4866
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are illdisposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second	93.4796
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair	221.6249
de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips	114.5982
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door	109.0699
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand	141.2049
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes	542.1159
at a quarter to six oclock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace	103.4063
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in two parties had set out for paris	61.7254
they are alive thats all that i can say about them from time to time i hear of them indirectly but in what part of the world they are devil take me if i know no on my honor i have not a friend in the world but you rochefort and the illustriouswhats the name of the lad whom i made a sergeant	69.0519
in piedmonts regiment planchet the illustrious planchet	1325.7145
living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word the young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned	76.1945
in eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave paris dartagnan had no time for a prolonged love siege	149.7170
and moreover my dear child continued dartagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian i do not understand you sir said raoul	53.6047
_parbleu_ at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day it is not that which deterred me replied monte cristo but as i determined to have a house to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought	71.3877
the house and furnished it but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris said beauchamp	126.8271
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron	742.2711
if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star	115.0904
the house to which dartagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening	90.7694
where are you going cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lovers calmness could not be real where are you going i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted	111.1917
man situated as i am may follow before you leave me tell me what you are going to do maximilian the young man smiled sorrowfully	80.5504
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwiseif he treated me diplomaticallythat is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in	167.3076
the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupantshe would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever	115.0110
however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken	96.2625
but aramis was livid	244.2648
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife port	153.6418
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women	70.9046
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more	74.1015
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures	216.9481
it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot wait said caderousse we shall see he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcantis hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless	88.5472
attitude of a servant whose master drives himself	177.2956
a note which you will find at home will tell you	57.8659
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m	153.6655
and who cares now about yanina which was taken as long ago as the year or that just shows the meanness of this slander	337.7211
at last his patience was exhausted	278.8006
it was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond	53.6971
dépinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then reenter with albert and châteaurenaud	237.6144
shall we obey asked blaisois	211.5435
m	nan
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	171.7045
ifaith colonel said dartagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast	178.9176
he immediately called dartagnan	372.6766
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring	221.0493
the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips	77.1765
a great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him	210.0333
i carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure one no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athoss ear what is the object of this visit continued he	78.5512
m florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill and he hastened to the door	139.1032
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the postingmaster	62.0079
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family	134.1010
ah sblood how you have hurt me my shoulder quite burns if you would permit me said dartagnan with timidity	146.0658
it is impossible said the procureur	17.1808
noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cabhorse	65.7348
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio	200.7091
ah if i knew sblood messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinals guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be	177.6437
arrested to laugh at you i am sure of itthey would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step	152.6064
bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose just the person we require at a time like the present said a second	162.4182
you will find me ready to follow you they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin dartagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens	79.9357
we shall require it yes gentlemen said dartagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do this new attack made no impression on mordaunt	193.7798
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die	52.1226
a moment after caderousses face appeared at the grating in the door	76.0880
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement	228.0260
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom	151.6810
dartagnan comprehended their irresolution	1806.4403
ah had any one but you been there i dont say dartagnan bowed	152.0950
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton	192.1291
i cannot stay here any longer with all my heart replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable	161.3159
if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement	92.4039
this night i have had a fearful sleep	116.5149
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunts foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	103.2231
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m	414.7885
it is a charming place well supplied with springwater and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after	298.0017
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince	32.2785
adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise	93.5251
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment	135.6967
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters	36.3800
come louise let us talk of our affairs	76.1733
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel	31.7193

this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn	180.9320
morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust ah said villefort this seems to me	76.4832
the truth	528.0355
may i congratulate you the affair is still in projection and he who says in projection means already decided said debray	196.9576
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out	108.2608
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric	168.6533
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one	70.2637
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii	29.5636
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of m	34.8222

it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much selfcontrol assuredly as for me i should have been incapable of it said châteaurenaud with most significant coolness	94.2938
the wretches were dancing	691.4767
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	143.6140
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan _thank you be easy_	380.4963
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams	126.3352
soon as kitty left him dartagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou	65.9960
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started	343.9850
you can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that i have passed with you	120.9639
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	192.3592
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	205.8866
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persistswell then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said milady perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future well here for example said richelieu when in	122.7469

my god at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened several men rushed into the chamber	69.1068
planchetart thou there cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears	100.1982
dame nanette look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet i am so fond of apricots broussel then proceeded to his wifes room and asked for breakfast it was nine oclock	133.4377

creek to the east in a right line	116.4051
how are you to get away from here	34.3410
the chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud voice here is a pardon for one of the prisoners a pardon cried the people with one voice a pardon at this cry andrea raised his head	108.9842
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as oceans most unfathomable caves	244.3719
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real	123.7794
it isbut you will not look will youit is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table	166.6704
now for the wager we listen monsieur athos yes the wager said the lighthorseman	185.5964
m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtiers room	97.6370

then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband	79.9284
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased	227.8959
it follows from this that the kings attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air	143.1279

the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	173.0253
dartagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind	49.2117

principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass	191.7287
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence	121.7972
but cried felton that is a _fleurdelis_ which i see there and therein consisted the infamy replied milady	248.3306

the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night	71.4482
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls	141.1243
noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house	223.9019

charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	78.4871
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackneycoachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres	127.9643
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	62.1154
to regret the world is to regret the devil that is my conclusion and that is mine also said the curate	104.0065
it is i who lose my cause and it is illluck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me to what do you refer said monte cristo with wellfeigned interest	85.0195
just so	147.0246
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so	51.8634

well here we are at last said one of them	40.4253
i was so delighted to see her again i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris for the cause which today takes us to england and what is this cause demanded aramis	83.3037
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majestys ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor dartagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the	165.4949
confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues	89.3983
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded madeleines brother entered dartagnans service	334.9956

your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting	274.5629
noirtier wishes to speak yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance	142.1597
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	92.4375
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count	179.6905
franz dépinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron dépinay by charles x the same said villefort	67.5974
ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely	39.8468
i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy	36.2639
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting	156.0067
i know the world is a drawingroom from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid that is to the purpose	132.1766
this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then by no means	98.0921
i never caution my servants a second timeremember that baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door	201.1473
surely answered danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys head meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form	512.6403
dartagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had notwhatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subjectbeen able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence	333.6878
then who reigns in france at this momentnapoleon ii no louis xviii the brother of louis xvi how inscrutable are the ways of providencefor what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased dantès whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes	316.9128
while occupying himself with the destinies of others	106.0871
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you withyou are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two	244.4118
heads of clans advanced upon the king	85.0912
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face	49.9400
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc dangoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home	139.8699
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	523.5001
with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths	207.0752
i said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the duc de beaufort who called for help	30.0572
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	68.1224
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment	171.5460
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m	68.5989
he hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devils punishment	163.7673
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them	254.7980
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made upwhen the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug	150.5656
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor	55.5822
he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside	100.7714
i remember now milady looked around her as if in search of something	89.6788
advance gentlemen said the cardinal	15.9975
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is	91.9554
possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotednesswhy i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone	123.5109

there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age	346.5999
the discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously	276.9257
it was evident that there was clamor and sedition	51.6188
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was mme	38.6202
they ask my age i tell it	241.8841
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of alberts eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the	125.5848
height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	108.2931
bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition	398.2816
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what	64.1827
his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches	277.5846
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously	64.1460
davrigny	nan
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night scoundrel murmured felton	128.0885
had dartagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character	112.7980
betrayed yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always loved better than the english	125.0523
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for this never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent	202.1750
me	nan
how so returned the count with surprise	72.4447
he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass	127.1286
on the sixth day the smugglers returned	82.0502
go on who were those men one of them was a foreigner english i think	137.5684
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	67.1092
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude	154.7479
the jailer went away shaking his head	63.2980
france will not perhaps be always ungrateful	100.1559
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission	99.7470
franz dépinay observed valentine	180.5856
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile	74.5095
in the first place i have never succeeded by that means	31.2000
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenantgeneral the count of morcerf peer of france oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretchto reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me no i did not say i was a stranger to you	144.8633
monsieur de st merri you begin my lord i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you who and what is this man a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter what is his name he is named planchet who himself also caused a rising about six	103.0446
weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared and can you find him i hope so	92.4922
i now believe in italian _banditti_ below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian _se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere_	230.5456
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos	48.6712
what then are you i am about to tell you wretched man oh mon dieu i am john francis de winter i do not know you said the executioner	44.4374
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison m oh pardon me sir let me live she is cowardly said villefort	176.6483
villefort after having received m	98.1556
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	43.5723
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum	186.6707
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller	75.4111
well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m	113.2934
no i must leave you at ten oclock your engagement was for breakfast then said the count	47.9571
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocketmirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible	93.8098
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us pshaw said monte cristo you will see him return to you gay smiling and joyful maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count	117.2349
did you know that no monseigneur	28.1832
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart	125.7858
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie	197.7133
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost mewell somewhere about francs debray conveyed the counts reply to the baroness	111.5425
when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings	98.0001
well that is not impossible	38.6867
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts	110.0269
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said	52.8094
i would as willingly accuse myself valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily no pity procureur the crime is fragrant	370.3294
did you come here to fetch me	20.1602
here we are said monte cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come in certainly i will my carriage shall take you back no thank you i gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow me there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage	51.1333
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds	325.0016
the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner	52.2117
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian	30.6355
oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are savedthe bark is supplied with provisions this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety	444.0490
m	nan
and bentivoglio who were poisoned	526.0637
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string	206.8075
what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	53.3376
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphaels picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object	88.9326
he hoped to meet with m	71.5144
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile	70.3991
i reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	350.8075
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum tomorrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm	84.5664
i can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us my son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes	106.8814
in the name of heaven explain yourself that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that i may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor	56.4855
on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends they reentered the drawingroom which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted	49.9812
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him	138.3789
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded	110.1446
and who has seen this _fleurdelis_ inquired aramis	117.6560
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	241.4305
captivity the fifth day milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her forces	263.4706
come haydée come and throwing his arm around the young girls waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared	80.3024
what wounded man the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by spaniards and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud a man between fiftyfive and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white	201.4361
do you know him asked the host	11.3549
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutors harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies	141.9113
it was illuminated by lamps with groundglass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoys weak sight	179.9507
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	135.3076
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe	207.9290
one momenti begfor here are the chevalier dherblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister	88.0727
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	478.3134
besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her	85.8999
debray had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong madame	66.1731
i am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a father	65.7522
during the first act the countess g entered	44.6542
it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question	81.1647
go said he quickly	45.1322
