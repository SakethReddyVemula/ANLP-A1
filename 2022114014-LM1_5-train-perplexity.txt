the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair	105.9160
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger	139.9492
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in	61.3282
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass	104.8146
is it your decision athos resumed the gascon	19.0775
the journey at two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st denis	142.2139
whom do i see yonder where in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that doora man wrapped in a cloak it is he cried dartagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man	77.2842
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog yes said porthos twill be at least a little change from beer chapter lxiii	186.3710
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another	33.8480
the council of the musketeers chapter xlviii	155.1719
morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet	361.9673
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence you think of starting at once then inquired mordaunt	63.7990
the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio	106.4496
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them	136.9265
dartagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal	101.2179
he will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memoryand this surely is not vanity but a justifiable prideit is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself	163.4630
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded	315.8488
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you noirtiers face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villeforts eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old mans heart	127.8013
you have promised me to go said the queen	22.7451
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses morrel smiled	163.8094
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performedhe believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us	244.4713
you are examining my den said aramis	12.8683
the burglary the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil accompanied by ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining	81.1519
information about the mission of project gutenberg project gutenberg is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middleaged and new computers	94.3148
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life	129.1414
and how proceed it is now eleven answered grimaud	715.6469
parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle	55.7232
this musketeer had just come off guard complained of having a cold and coughed from time to time affectedly	407.8543
dartagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or lookingindeed as if he had never seen them before	110.1394
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos	121.8663
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil	144.8515
dartagnan related his story simply with the omission of names	1069.7845
are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars	75.4587
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a laborsaving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre	266.0358
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinals cap then he added so my friend its your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape thats my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it	58.4656
yes that is my name you said then by the word of bonacieux	146.2610
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes	60.4519
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectatori who was watching the working of this mournful tragedyi who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart morrel groaned	201.3809
de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze	141.4576
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	154.8243
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis dartagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m	111.6650
but what did you do yesterday after you left me i went to tortonis where as i expected i found beauchamp and châteaurenaud	250.3449
no one ever asked her where she was going	83.4163
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady	2726.3499
you must have much reason to complain of him not very much said dartagnan	30.1998
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the _lorgnette_ and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	127.1196
you raised the whole district so they told me very nearly replied planchet with a selfsatisfied air	77.5530
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview	146.6929
you and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him	53.4784
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river	70.6708
hes not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do	159.2907
so i will not abandon this bouquet _pardieu_ returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the _contadini_ the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his buttonhole	140.2858
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much you have rightly guessed madame replied the count	84.1685
morrel and so you see lest he might do you an injury well why i paid him but cried dantès it was a hundred and forty francs i owed caderousse yes stammered the old man	67.9477
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his whitebellied blackclawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him	176.3961
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	162.8226
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republics which deputed david to devise a uniform for the academicians indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly and what is his especial talent his talent	150.2767
ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men	177.9247
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them	215.9566
the harlequin had reassumed her peasants costume and as she passed she raised her mask	115.8603
you may see matters differently dartagnan and think otherwise	155.2766
you know the interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux	296.2794
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos	49.1595
the gascon is the devil cried athos nothing escapes him the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis	98.3745
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her	82.5296
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments	105.4082
you who have chateau meadows mountains woodsyou who have forty thousand francs a yearyouarenothappy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	119.8405
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	49.9920
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my fosterfather has been in normandy the last three days who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunessir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief	83.5576
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented	69.7537
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmonds last wishes the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow	113.2331
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city	77.3924
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her the young and highspirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath	273.9155
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon and what did monsieur dartagnan reply monsieur dartagnan promised me his assistance but i soon found out that he was betraying me you impose upon justice	107.2887
whywhat do you mean by that question i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these	87.9537
our readers already know how he was recognized by dartagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey	221.1246
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me	46.5378
yes and thats all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter	45.3720
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss	1336.4550
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that charles i	160.8394
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping i do not understand you you rely on the usurpers return we do you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the th or th he will be at lyons and on the th or th at paris the people will rise yes to go and meet him he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him yes to escort him into the capital	106.5844
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companions elbow directed his attention by his glances	276.9991
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea	156.2885
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor tell me who this man was cried the young officer	77.0781
everything is in readiness for our flight and we can select any time we choose	163.5343
de villefort relieved all dantès apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort	45.2627
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him	344.4682
more than that we shall have a tempest or i dont know whats what you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon luckily the captain understood his business	179.8073
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not yes and it was they who told you something which made you angry	103.1271
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man	18.1645
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise	431.0584
ah dont be angry i beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me	73.1017
and wherefore should they do so	21.8950
you are perhaps a tulip fancier my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so	70.4749
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hopeher only means of safety	410.3074
devil take it he muttered to himself dont let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them well then said athos what are your schemes	112.1315
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villeforts for the purpose of returning the procureurs visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion	60.0995
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmonds misfortunes no i only know that some time after edmonds arrest he married mademoiselle de saintméran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand	85.7386
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel	105.7556
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips	63.3104
take this ring raise money with it and let your husband set out in an hour you shall be obeyed you see the address said the queen speaking so low that mme	62.2047
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard	86.3459
but it has none in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank	75.8210
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself	78.2773
but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray	123.2081
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages	61.5002
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away	1639.8632
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat	72.9789
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin	164.5051
expenses on the road about fifty francs	54.5196
edmond and mercédès were clasped in each others arms	95.8342
de troisville as his family was still called in gascony or m	117.6755
on both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of enthusiasm	93.8221
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light no valentine i assure you such is not the case	101.4481
de morcerf inquired eugénie does anybody know mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversingthe young woman is a greek so i should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as wellinformed as yourself i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _cicerone_ replied morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicateyes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzlait is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own then your count entertains visitors does he asked madame danglars	128.6521
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing	11.5871
did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty louis and who was the winner nautilus	618.0645
oh very shortly madame said he but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day	55.5630
it may be imagined that dartagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramiss ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and dont make the least noise aramis awoke	101.7275
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune	65.2507
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so	34.9808
villeforts impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied	54.3494
dont you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	95.4250
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wife_diable_ and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true	208.8570
surely answered danglars one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebodys head meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form	286.1548
that is doubtless our boat said athos	17.1424
make free now you have begun no you are after all a good companion i will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold i shall not sell itdo not fear not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man	77.9062
almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning	131.2832
grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the diamond	195.3559
oh my god my god cried mme	83.2593
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass	110.9189
you are quite upset come come tell me i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness athos said dartagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheardof story well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend	145.2966
danglars asked for a knife and fork	2840.3379
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant	67.6691
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier	101.0632
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air	97.1521
he urged the horse again into a trot	389.4970
i dont know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord was the woman handsome young and beautiful	140.5721
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne what would you have	69.1332
well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened	363.2873
dépinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old mans eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection	79.5045
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise	67.5117
to command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for her	112.6329
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood	59.5926
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the counts daughter	64.6991
the cardinals hair stood on end	1491.0953
such a thing is really out of ruleeccentric or stupid	1811.0486
you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones yes but we do not invite people of fashion	224.1742
at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only threequarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavernkeeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace	74.1214
dartagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands	193.0820
alas how few today exist plague ont my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me no i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers monsieur dartagnan	97.8106
let us go then said athos	19.3751
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de contis generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	160.1871
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign	128.3088
both were addressed to king charles	179.1308
dartagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords	155.5261
de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead	125.5323
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received it	102.1852
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me how dear sister said lord de winter	83.9512
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head	182.3005
her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground	329.1947
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it	117.2344
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen	128.0167
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you	63.1900
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity	156.5495
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged	137.3418
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital	110.3577
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two menhow do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented	211.0842
and to sign the contract in three days yes then in my turn i also say very well danglars pressed his daughters hand in his	69.7105
joannes _ma foi_ said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight	95.9715
have you seen him yes sir said mordaunt	29.1406
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared	132.2264
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom	93.7801
guiche knew everybodymadame de neuillan mademoiselle daubigne mademoiselle de scudery mademoiselle paulet madame de chevreuse	203.6734
i have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the french	146.3728
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	165.9567
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance	140.8352
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left	28.4503
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape	67.6165
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour	48.3788
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenants heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events	93.1489
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider	150.4686
dartagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains	494.2522
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris	187.3735
monsieur maninahurry you can find me without running_me_ you understand and where i pray you near the carmesdeschaux at what hour about noon about noon	244.1842
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted	52.0669
yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renées the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count	211.9200
it was like having a spy in the enemys camp	215.2634

it is edmond and mercédès ah see there now said caderousse and i did not recognize them hallo dantès hello lovely damsel come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us hold your tongue will you said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor	167.4511
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	103.0854
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the hôtel and went to his apartment	48.6191
have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thingi mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to	180.3643

now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door	122.5028
the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abbé faria had spread the riches of his mind	81.8672
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell	256.5078
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it	36.9045
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	368.8821
suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture	369.9487
i will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors	137.3236
every door was opened to him	22.4789
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting her noirtier made a sign that he would listen	60.0598
this was more than poor bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced he uttered a feeble groan which might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man and fainted	70.6099
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements	338.5293
you will have pity on me ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask	77.3756
ten minutes later the curate of st sulpice was announced	191.6297
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne cried the former musketeer	207.2500
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	32.9087
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne	138.7793
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes	162.1798
oh yes but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover	196.2553
while i watched the window he guarded the door good said athos	60.7497
dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters	127.1084
it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay talking of captain leclere has not dantès given you a letter from him to menowas there one i believe that besides the packet captain leclere confided a letter to his care of what packet are you speaking danglars why that which dantès left at portoferrajo how do you know he had a packet to leave at portoferrajo danglars turned very red	141.6949
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly	144.6097
and why were you alone m because you had been arrested edmond and were a prisoner and why was i arrested	119.3133
oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein	89.1678

the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions	80.9624
what is this said aramis on seeing them arrive	322.0678
de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress	1469.8517

those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier	570.7360
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze	193.3376
at eight oclock in the morning morrel entered their chamber	93.3163
i think so indeed he has six millions worth he must sell them at whatever price why because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain m how do you know debray shrugged his shoulders	151.5984
this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow	137.0794
the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing	34.5349
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	240.2673
this league was directed against france	3609.0791
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him	76.4321
wait whilst i light the lamp said la carconte it is growing dark and there may be some mistake in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last halfhour	101.9033
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread	141.5936
de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the _entrée_ by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber	92.8754
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	204.1998
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to dartagnan who pressed it respectfully	34.4154
what did your excellency say inquired the other	75.3221

they employ him because they are afraid of him	19.7236
gentlemen said dartagnan you shall have your turn	106.2582

dartagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword	46.5128
i have seen them before as ugly no but reasonably hideous what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar pshaw said de guiche	160.1769
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides	217.8504
at halfpast one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert	128.7924
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary dartagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach	335.9529
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackneycoach then the coachmans voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows	117.3482
madame will be tired tonight continued monte cristo and will no doubt wish to rest	54.9189
do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you	115.3003
de trévilles where he had dined	3018.6116
the coachman stooped down for his orders	52.2770
in england the post was well served	586.5319
well said morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes	251.4073
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither	86.6919
a procurators dinner however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurators wife	48.9633
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy	196.5848

although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him i will obey your orders my lord goodbye until saturday when i may expect you may i not yes i promised you the count watched albert waving his hand to him	57.4447
peppino was a handsome young man of four or fiveandtwenty bronzed by the sun he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear	123.4413
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement	308.6170
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	110.8404
there was then amongst that crowd a moments hesitation which looked like shame	323.6623
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information to auteuil cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became lividi go to auteuil well what is there surprising in that	162.3280

he awaited mazarins promised visit to get some light on his present situation	76.3827
the queen gave them to me the queen requires them again	198.8136
guard the prisoners well i beg of you the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and dartagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	50.7492
athos walked about in a contemplative mood	140750.4844
we are so good and gentle to your eminence	90.2451
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit	30.4586
but from whom did this ring come to you athos from my mother who inherited it from her mother	135.9999
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris do you hesitate asked mazarin	83.6556
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady	186.5115

what is the matter maximilian asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead morrel fell into a chair	80.8971
the cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in italy	80.5891
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood	1956.7114
oh said dartagnan we dont now make war as we did formerly	192.7643

dartagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the night	121.6659
at the first words of the count de guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything	133.3626

dartagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing	48.7100
dantès was beside himself with joy	105.1672
there he told the chief allhis affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins	197.4617
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard	72.2605
count count added she you know that i wait for you at this appeal dartagnan drew kitty quietly away and slipped into the chamber	99.5075
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht	76.2076

my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation you see cried dartagnan	234.3399
monsieur dartagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed dartagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle	57.0619

i pardon you said he the ill you have done me	145.8536

de tréville being there to claim them	392.8814
de villefort was not at table	421.2889
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart	68.5430
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the _pharaon_eh danglars danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness	220.1160
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated	45.7383

danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate fortunes i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins	183.0157
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke dangouleme were called the petitsmaitres	150.4940

the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat what said athos no fish at a seaport they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos	113.5974

if while he was being carried out the gravediggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose	106.3991

albert was charmed with the counts manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge	164.6089

he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the men of the south had small hands and feet	166.9146
ah dont touch me pray dont by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen	142.3407
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	37.1410
to be a bishop aramis answered dartagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear	106.9019
milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened	30.7916
stand here dont stir turn your back to the road and wait for me having thus spoken dartagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village	133.6458

ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets i fear that is true said dartagnan in a low tone	48.3594
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united	160.3382
at the outer door the steward paused	1417.7257
and on what floor does he live asked comminges	149.4016
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth	45.0773
let us be open with each other and sincere what cried the gascon do you think athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and aramis no answered athos embrace me my son zounds said porthos sobbing i believe im crying but how foolish all this is then they embraced	107.7296

cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence i do not understand stammered lucien	94.0382
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him	54.9109
m if you wish it my son said the major and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his head on the others shoulder	60.4995
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected	124.2808
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream	114.3207
at ten oclock the kings collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers	94.0566

how has this terrible past been recalled cried villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame alas said hermine doubtless it is chance chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this	156.5723

keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it the young man then entered the apartment of aramis	52.5636
some traveller seems impatient said the host	10.8222
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul	425.4980
at this moment the door of the ministers box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	144.0998
yes and who is the man i do not know why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ballroom to find you oh said the countess to franz go with all speedpoor young man perhaps some accident has happened to him i will hasten replied franz	88.3244

ah my dear replied dartagnan upon that very horse i came to paris what does monsieur know this horse said mousqueton	155.6965
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier	130.8264
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse	160.1628
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage	90.8751

his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal highness m	148.8813
there the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed	223.6053
oh why did i not tell you all	20.2297
well asked the cardinal on seeing la houdinière return	1464.3077

four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table	161.4308
dearest exclaimed valentine with her adorable smile awake and look at me morrel uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees	135.9045

oh i cannot go without taking leave of her i cannot die without confiding her to someone he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahisand son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseillesthe sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brotherinlaw emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness	195.2565
de tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress	109.6009
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at portovecchio and tunis	144.1382
adieu sir one wordone single word more doctor you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me	93.0107

go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you	78.2499
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever	65.8074
at length an old wormeaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of dartagnan	132.5937
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	150.5174
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late you see said athos pointing to mme	68.7353
caderousse terrified looked at the count	20.0829
penelon replied julie go and inform m	586.9415
m how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared	67.9592
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the icecold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves	284.0565
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	78.4598
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	121.7652
well answered the boy the thing is done where is he gone the halfpistole is for me doubtless answer me i want to see it	79.1390

that knife was for you my lad she would have killed you	53.5287
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself	147.9022
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m	150.7457
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	94.6890
i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet	2225.1204
on the following morning at five oclock dartagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mothers recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor dartagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow	199.9110
is he still one of the seventeen peers of france he is dead sir a great loss	125.9374
no pity for him who had no pity die impenitent die in despair die and be damned and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan	153.6445
it was written and signed by albert	94.5379
in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind	228.1121
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni	63.5773
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m	73.9820
we cannot fight with such names they are names of shepherds therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said athos	265.5442
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers	70.9206
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me	82.8741
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	114.8059
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all	73.0312
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me	123.9932
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for dartagnans embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i knowyou with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent kingyou my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as dartagnan porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right athos arose	110.4743
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes i do not think so my lord said bernouin but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed	66.1671
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it said athos	42.0986
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that	29.2038
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me well well the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brothers servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop but dartagnan dartagnan if he comes shall we not know it how nothing easier	81.3812
you called me didnt you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table	80.9413
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisiansthat is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received	150.2578
what is that again he asked	172.2984

the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes	105.1056
endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king	26.8788
towards the evening of the third day	204.4991
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream	29.0878
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said	46.9053
i cannot resist doing so he must live zounds replied dartagnan why dont you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch	113.7061
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient	183.1049
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little i should like to say something evil of mazarin is it permissible go on go on replied dartagnan laughing heartily relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him	120.8807
but dartagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it	63.2747
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly _london sir if you please and my master lord dartagnan_	162.7382
everything is best in its time monseigneur	308.7300
m albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea	148.6971
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	96.7223
i wrote the word _finis_ at the end of the sixtyeighth strip about a week ago	98.5556
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just nowblood will have blood	967.7722
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy	241.6471
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely	205.6124
de châteaurenaud exaggerates not worth speaking of cried châteaurenaud life is not worth speaking ofthat is rather too philosophical on my word morrel	219.0358
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three dartagnanswith two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men	146.9339
it is something to be well received	1043.3241
debray my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you	124.6888
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait ah a monthsix monthsa year it is too long a time	125.6452
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted	215.9454
as ten oclock was striking dartagnan left m	302.4735
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the _mene mene tekel upharsin_ of belshazzar	368.4061
well said cucumetto have you executed your commission yes captain returned carlini	330.8849
ah my child my poor child cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief	102.5925
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps silence laporte you may be overheard	138.8627
another queen in want of help	458.6799
go on count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called grief m i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and i almost did so	120.6462
dartagnan thought this was the moment to interfere	608.6721
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity	2300.6846
one moment longer and all would disappear	2437.1682
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars	97.9272
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance	875.0508
alas do you love nothing else in me asked dartagnan	40.2444
m i rave said morrel well then i appeal to m	69.4619
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through arras	113.4828
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom_non bis in idem_	179.6271
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission	93.3789

m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto	165.5902
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and dartagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche	74.9195
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion	472.2999
i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect you yes from the abbé busoni no from whom then from an englishman called lord wilmore who takes the name of sinbad the sailor and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbé busoni you are mistaken there i am ahead of you you have seen him then yes once where ah that is just what i cannot tell you if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do and what did the letter contain read it you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy	74.4906

the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	64.8038
ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize halloo halloo friends to horse to horse several horsemen ran quickly to him	225.5266
almost an impossibility replied the major	64.6984
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you heyday cried dartagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell whos an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman	243.8119
the road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the duc denghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of charles vii	184.2822
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied dartagnan	64.7499
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year	61.1791
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	346.8064
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m	158.8076
dartagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais what then the bodies were not plundered were they	153.5639
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man	81.8006
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced	103.4051
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door	61.8596
this account confirmed that of the mayor	81.6878
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia	99.0836
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why	111.3671
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him	36.9516
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague ont how fast you go one may soon see that youre a soldier	117.5403
their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when dead yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything	106.6002
m give way said the traveller	895.0271
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival	98.8008
run run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husbands cries	67.7910
the insult at the bankers door beauchamp stopped morcerf	398.6257
franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of braccianos	53.2261
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again	178.8427
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawingroom m	87.9943

oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of davrigny	215.3432
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	72.9837
it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing	110.5343
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king	80.4072
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all	87.1205
the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward	26.3603
my dear count allow me to show you the way they passed silently into the breakfastroom and everyone took his place	64.8268
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance	183.6168
pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little this evening you said well this evening will come thank god and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend	75.2244
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution	150.9518
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	84.3529
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more	104.7952
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart	76.0917
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m	83.0609
this lady is infamous my lord milady de winter is an angel you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you bah are you mad to talk to me thus said buckingham	66.7633
dartagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	68.4485
ah said the count watching andreas countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca	102.1660
too late by a minute cried he too late by a minute oh my god my god what a misfortune he had been informed at seven oclock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to miladys chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution dartagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton	93.1272
during this time porthos played close	344.7933
well take your hat and gloves returned monte cristo	148.6446
the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed	64.8155
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt	58.1369
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that	68.1917
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two is monsieur aramis with dartagnan asked lord de winter	116.3195
why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me	131.8117
and pray what do you call such an action but who said it was buried alive why bury it there if it were dead	155.1264
if he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks i shall soon reestablish my business and dont forget said dartagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen and now said athos while they bring the wine tell me dartagnan what has become of the others come dartagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee and aramis at a table between two theologians	119.7975
we have something very important to say to him i understand said athos but why not porthos	57.9684
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow voice	66.6493
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared	1129.7146
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champsélysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up	77.6902
she extended her hands to him with a smile	22.5901
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there	205.8770
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him	78.1402
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do	58.8158
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same	309.4789
great god cried dartagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen	137.6172
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged	66.0735
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them	92.4051
women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve oclock	286.7061
what undertaking can have brought him to paris	11.4247
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrinis the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting	102.2613
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your motherinlaw in the presence of m	60.1969
there said dartagnan what did i tell you	8.7308
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered	170.0731
mordaunt remained standing near the door	2.1785
do you remember how he cried on dartagnan on i am taken	196.9734
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors	404.1342
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica	112.9249
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back	94.6211
as for you illustrious descendant of william tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another lodging the swiss began to laugh boisterously	230.3143
no no be easy on that score	372.3080
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might betry again you have a few minutes work there and he advanced to the window	105.2426
athos in his hours of gloomand these hours were frequentwas extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness	261.2758
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz dépinays possession signed by me and with a postscript of m	113.9807
you know what athos told you the other day you eat at everybodys mess	700.4130
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	72.2321
today i am engaged in a different affair	129.3524
alas i do replied athos with a deep sigh	44.5893
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood	64.9366
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé	35.3980
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers athos smiled	173.8840
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count	50.5039
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself ah ah said porthos that is what you meant to say yes dear monsieur porthos	102.9688
i am about to struggle for the last time with them	38.6760
no count of monte cristo added debray	602.6251
ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our revenge	137.3579
my vocation commands me it carries me away dartagnan smiled but made no answer	109.2977
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of halflight that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	102.4597
attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to dantès but dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months	89.8942
search among your friends your oldest friends what do you mean monsieur nothing else than i saysearch alas i look around me in vain i have no influence with any one	80.2138
are you all here he asked	153.8796
an instant after they were on the deck	154.0125
at the third knock however steps were heard inside	419.1427
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom	205.9628
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy	139.5850
boisgoli tell noirmont that i have two guests	88.9758
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger	250.2852
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the _mandaïa_	120.8294
as for winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified	113.1882
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric	112.8046
they stopped him at the door	10.5009
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood	80.4001
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham	340.0603
davrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips	36.9416
it is not gods will that they should be accomplished	54.5897
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart go monsieur de bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed	85.2827
presently presently cried the latter when you havent your cloak on at one oclock then behind the luxembourg very well at one oclock then replied dartagnan turning the angle of the street	79.9098
you see it makes a very respectable appearance _pardieu_ cried dartagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme	77.0477
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not i know nothing said m	34.9387
and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation	354.9511
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor	325.0238
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future	88.8717
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am dartagnan dont you know me	28.1834
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me	115.9511
is the abbé at home asked he	59.6797
this garden has never been a cemetery what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently	747.4944
the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles	96.3816
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians anne was caught she could not draw backshe signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep	134.9833
no longer could edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	91.7544
dartagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him	45.9201
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled	96.0863
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy	140.9033
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twentyfive years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	89.2252
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat	142.3122
never a mistake or delaya fellow who paid like a prince	38.7447
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor	75.6258
our purveyor yes your purveyor godeauthe purveyor of the musketeers my faith never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it no said athos dont let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source you are right athos said dartagnan	102.3165
sit down and let us talk it over milady murmured athos	197.1897
to horse my friends to horse and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune	63.9208
yes a passage of st augustine upon which we could not agree said the gascon	57.6296
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened	109.0185
i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled	152.3640
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states	26.8635
why should i but still there are some signals only addressed to you certainly and do you understand them they are always the same and they mean _nothing new you have an hour_ or _tomorrow_ this is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ah yes thank you sir and what is it sayinganything you understand yes it asks if i am ready and you reply by the same sign which at the same time tells my righthand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my lefthand correspondent to prepare in his turn it is very ingenious said the count	117.3931
then you shall not leave this place said he	49.8411
ah believe me edmond as i told you i too have suffered much i repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet over	113.3430
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer	46.8558
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother	186.5916
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers thats true said dantès but the corridor you speak of only bounds _one_ side of my cell there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it	150.4805
now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going	106.9954
it was one of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket	519.6122
what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers he had scarcely finished when dartagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time	102.7247
we have had a narrow escape but said valentine timidly does all the fathers shame revert upon the son	191.8200
but what is going on in this accursed paris what is going on my lord	147.6229
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another mans fortune	107.8064
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flowergarden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him	81.5562
i say that valentine is dead replied davrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness	163.9618
come come continued darminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast	166.6854
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait	234.0179
benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn	118.9357
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times and from that date up to the present day a hundred times perhaps so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreadshe who dreads nothing as it is said	140.8372
the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also	626.6978
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness	80.1852
he will be condemned will he not asked debray of beauchamp	254.4214
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice	139.2384
de morcerf is it that excellent m	659.6426
the names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he cannot tell you proper names are not in the dictionary oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father sir sir cried he turning to noirtier do what you canmake me understand in some way yes replied noirtier	119.1771
meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician	157.2688
i am not mistaken dartagnan cried rochefort	452.7798
oh no no do not go away exclaimed dartagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you athosof such a man as you aramis and he threw himself into the arms of athos	68.0073
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds	77.3090
planchet called his masters attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces	60.2415
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count	31.4205
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself	103.3149
yes grandpapa said valentine it is so	8.7245
the approach was not such as to prepossess peoplean illsmelling dark passage a staircase halflighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet	511.3442
dartagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds	155.7480
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	125.2069
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too	416.5942
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father	84.7517
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step	66.8854
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork	1138.0518
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champsélysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel	128.1703
dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve	157.2537
dartagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy	334.0809
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience	54.1746
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you	147.7787
you are questioning me like a kings attorney	81.4511
he is asleep and the spanish woman dreaming and the cursed italian he is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away its for some purpose rely on it	165.3583
well well my dear edmond continued the owner dont let me detain you	65.7988
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten	69.0628
ifaith yes said athos for i am hungry look out for the black fowls cried aramis	138.5863
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head	162.8535
where he was no one knew	1483.9731
de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he	51.2518
as to dartagnan he sprang toward jussac himself	2879.0364
on the days when he won he was insolent and ostentatious if he lost he disappeared completely for several days after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person but with money in his purse	173.3826
i point one of the poniards at la ramees breast and i say to him my friend i am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words	114.5767
aramis started back and drew his	4.1308
diavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil everythingeverything is going on famously	753.6119
andrea was supported by two priests	2105.7434
i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her	66.0203
why the good god sends him back again caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair	118.2772
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other	70.2111
but what are you about there	146.9143
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met de rochefort	65.5621
it was a lovely starlight nightthey had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into lightwaves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous oceanwaves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes dowaves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp	814.0774
this announcement was received in silence	169.4569
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes	109.0428
a handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not my faith said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you	80.8354
fie pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher higher	164.5463
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead	122.4368
why in the first place i gave you fifty you think so _pardieu_ ah that is true	94.2419
poor danglars looked so crestfallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him	121.5011
no said she withdrawing it gentlyno my friend touch me not	262.2740
determined to put the advice of m	11.8610
m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life	204.0654
mademoiselles ladys maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied	131.5268
dartagnan signed to them to draw near	98.8900
decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young mans hand	14.1585
he was armed at all points	385.9030
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	56.8047
you can form no idea of the expression of that old mans eye when he looks at me the only person in the world whom he loves and i had almost said by whom he is beloved in return	65.2968
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i cannot leave	39.7516
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham palace	52.1024
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the waxlight always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment	264.4783
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge	127.9437
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest sons welfare	215.0371
de tréville generally held so sacred became in an instant the annex of the antechamber	175.8251
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue	38.9451
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked dartagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	192.8417
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch	222.7027
what the deuce can you expect	206.0364
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity	55.0185
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so there was a moments silence during which the noise of the bankers pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling	88.6373
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so	88.1249
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	70.2926

the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction and that will not be long it is to be hoped said porthos for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes	74.3560
but pardon said dartagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young mans shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing mordaunt stopped short	145.4979
thence introduced into a halfsubterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment	108.6959
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder	108.1170
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty what has become of him	146.2762
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five oclock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the _coupé_ of the diligence which closed upon her	69.8503
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship	182.3603
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained	275.9208
a mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment	235.7924
this time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined mordaunt	196.3083
it is singular said dartagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i cannot yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight oclock before they raised anchor	88.4057
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but dartagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down tonight upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur dartagnan to the end of the world	73.6461
oh i am very presuming i am aware	8.5591
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry	77.4084
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him	112.6555
noirtier had once made a will against youagainst your familyin favor of the poor in fact m	881.9148
she then thought that lord de winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her jailer	82.1465

the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirtyfive	215.2862
oh the devil thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours oh lord no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as i cannot possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud which i have not yet had time to remove the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions dartagnan had conceived	104.8136
do you still wish to dispose of all yes but they will contest the will after your death no my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph	106.4948
and why in this solemn drawingroom when the study is so comfortable i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation	137.3927
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within	110.6905
i do not wish to be left alone mother said the young man you know how gladly i would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening well replied mercédès sighing go albert i will not make you a slave to your filial piety albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her	109.9342

monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm	120.4611

except that which i ask of you dear love but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness i cannot wait till tomorrow silence i hear my brother	66.0233
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming	79.4625

now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellousthat which we do not understand	94.5824

they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	82.9661
once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten banknotes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all	195.8176
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal	15.5687

the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg sainthonoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris	111.5510

the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with châteaurenaud and beauchamp	111.0036
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the onehalf per cent it had originally paid	419.8726
i recognized your name in it	126.0524

yes sire yes it is the same and your majesty has a good memory come how shall we decide said the king	66.1730
a kind of steward appeared just as dartagnan and his companions were prepared to mount	79.3469
let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish but dont mistake said dartagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may thinkfor it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received	152.0043
explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt everything because having neither arms nor password we shouldnt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms yes but before we can kill himand he will be hard to kill that swisshe will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun	154.5043
that is the least we owe her thats true said athos but that concerns aramis well replied the latter blushing what must i say oh thats simple enough replied athos	89.5013
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	238.8061
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the _pharaon_ yes and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl yes now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things	111.3436
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival	124.8481
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly	120.0351

why dont we go in with them asked porthos	95.5578

then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i cannot fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambricthough cambric was dear at the periodbut a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor	131.8315

the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son	81.4530
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m	152.2648
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant	111.1131
here doctor said he is what you sent me for was this prepared in your presence yes replied the procureur	163.1030

let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you	30.1804
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual	352.8345
what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence and shall we go and find him inquired franz	85.9793
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation	73.0191

morrels daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old oneeyed cashier called cocles or cockeye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted beehive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it	120.8754
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely dartagnan his captaincy porthos his barony	138.2165
this letter had been conveyed by dartagnan and had arrived in time	24.0114
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered miladys apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends	120.2803
the conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus	310.0272
were our object money only he said we should be rich directly hows that dont you understand porthos	146.7876
however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian lifea life of politeness visiting and introductions monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty	222.0177
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus	46.3301
it may be judged whether dartagnan looked or listened with avidity	385.9381
my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks	102.4852
by no means it really seems to me very curious yes indeed	97.4776
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didnt mean mischiefthats my opinion too said the captain and ill take precautions accordingly	208.7398
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law	76.5207
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak	261.2718
he also morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of men well asked morrel	227.2972
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini	100.8514
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on somebody	197.7803
well then we will put simply _my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_ my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	220.8150
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile	221.8767
benedetto yes and to the point	331.6332
leave the room and send me a woman women are very indiscreet my sister	147.4752

anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinalhis physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur	187.2899
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord	19.1445

it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of dartagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated	232.3005
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coollysuch were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely	204.8216
stop said he i will go with you excuse me sir said franz since m	93.8356
the place royalebe it so replied athos	24.9681
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms	105.9773

what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated no returned the count	218.3664

ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to dartagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture	47.0384
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba	37.2803
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps	33.6371
adieu dear sister till your next swoon this was all that milady could endure	387.8069
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns	174.8127

in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flagstones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance	149.4147
how is it that i have never met you at his house i am no acquaintance of m	67.1294
on seeing him dartagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise	489.4700
i am planchetplanchet whom you know well but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview	89.2806
dartagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen	37.5559
he was not however a good sleeper	5683.7075
well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work today this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result	177.5595
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	368.0811
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders	126.9753
the soldier went out leaving the dinner served	211.0014
life for life man for man give me one i will give you the other i dont know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creaturethe more so as you tell me this dartagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal	132.5582
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy	168.4753
he went to bed at his usual hour and slept in peace	136.5220
tell him all this for me for these are things which a king cannot say for himself thanks sire thanks said the duke but your majesty may be assured that it is not thosei do not speak of monsieur de trévillewhom your majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you ah you have heard what i said	80.3479
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him	102.7458
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you	125.3595
having accomplished these three social duties monte cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my duty now let others do theirs andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count	52.0117
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner	36.2896
adieu perhaps farewell at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw	79.0570

stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear dartagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray dartagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure	92.6032
_peste_ matters are going all right should you know those doors again yes do you know the numbers yes what are they no in the rue de vaugirard in the rue de la harpe thats well said the cardinal	41.1931
and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs whilst dartagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present circumstances	72.7614
the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life	249.4217
then turning to grimaud very good my friend very good	64.7702
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me	109.2182
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive	94.5845
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her	99.4935
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been	87.6872
what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo	45.7104
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat	81.5554

dartagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army	86.6347
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter	75.6163
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	95.5475
yes said athos it reminds me of a family jewel it is beautiful is it not said dartagnan	39.9043

very good said groslow and opened the door of the room	19.4006
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course	88.2110

i am from gascony it is true and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel	68.0398
but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow	73.9094

they are men who do nothing for nothing you know the only reply that i desire said dartagnan the only one worthy of you and of me and he drew nearer to her	83.2665
did you ever see that man before he came twice to miladys thats it	176.1453

he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased	206.9226
may i not go and see my friends yes sir you shall see them	39.8825
if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments i could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your thoughts	89.0391

thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman	176.7971
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him	202.0754
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known	151.4881
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter xix	65.5875
i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos and the travelers continued their route	227.3562

the company went on speaking of the poet voiture	276.0905
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest	113.2784
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	152.8427

indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a firstrate paris tailorprobably blin or humann	344.8656
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé this was the orthodox phrase	176.7199
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eelsall light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said dartagnan who furnishes the wine	302.6723
on arriving at the cradle from which paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat	133.1205
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance	101.1525

i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the sorti suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing	125.5622
here i am dear count welcome home again i arrived an hour since from dieppe no from tréport indeed and i have come at once to see you that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference	126.7190
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble	79.1203
let us sit down to supper	4236.3916
not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious manner	57.6101
then valentines attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds	111.0591
cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard	89.2272
dartagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent	270.5583
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris	57.3178
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly my faith monsieur that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days and me too said dartagnan	103.7568
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself	58.4047
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised dartagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	99.5923
your history is a terrible one mr mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an allpowerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information my lord to a wellbred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other but this relation you mentioneddo you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwells person	116.5145
as dartagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer	60.1590
but there is nothing which would donothing m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help	117.7864
he remembered the count of monte cristo	1.8503
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it	106.7422
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	2143.1675
there is an excellent tavern at compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been there	121.2566
now mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew	236.8153
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbageleaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate	252.2757
i congratulate you my dear m	67.1481
i will however inform monsieur dartagnan of your arrival here comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery	51.0125
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future	187.7171
while monsieur darminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry	87.3291
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort	108.3970
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	143.8188
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit	624.5994
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london	30.0031
but no i should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	94.0179
what is the matter then with this dear child	96.4442
madame de villefort was overpowered her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared	81.3082
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady	148.7976
why did you not say so at once my dear sir all england is with cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners i bend sir to your wishes	130.7824

this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau	242.3021
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said dartagnan to the youth	38.6336

behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with waxlights	955.4155
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bedhead but his mother	289.5182
well said franz to his friend what think you of all this why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stockjobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds or some prince travelling _incog_ hush hush replied franz we shall ascertain who and what he ishe comes as franz spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men	154.6962
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled	909.7800
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures	160.2004

now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m	278.6862
ho ho exclaimed dartagnan picking up a louis and displaying it heres a louis that smells confoundedly of straw mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gaycome along mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it	197.8231

at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us	152.3338
good answered grimaud and he went right to the prisoner	111.4708
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine	77.8287
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour	104.3276
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted	114.7305
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink	232.4319
signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted	92.6301

aramis if that is all it is easily done said porthos	56.2910
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you now that i see you young and with a promising futurenow that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth edmond turned away his head with a sigh	107.6599
ah ah but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos	131.2243

madame de saintméran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saintméran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m	255.0832
laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty	172.9164

i am afraid he has turned out ill she added	239.8164
what news exclaimed a general burst of voices	279.8000
i will make planchet brush my boots and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate	134.4452
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of courseof course said the prisonersanyone can see hes a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper	95.2280
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language	887.4388
the same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house m villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air	92.6408
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place i must speak to monsieur de tréville on an affair of importance	110.5145
ough and not without a deal of trouble too has the executioner left london asked athos	264.8882

decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos	41.7122
a woman could go up a ladder like that aramiss searching look seemed to seek his friends thought even at the bottom of his heart but dartagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity	139.8096

i my lordwho told you that nobody but i know it i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria	55.8654
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos	79.0111
cruel enough if i am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges	138.9445
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris	62.3214
try aramis to keep near the king	19.1552
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	454.3505
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror	240.5988

say there is no need why dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he should	229.6063
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood	81.3843
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment	58.4137
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the illjoined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars	189.1958
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have assertedalas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where	105.8013
youll excuse me i know they exchanged bows and dartagnan returned to his companions	177.3011
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw	90.4614
ah if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said dartagnan	76.1451
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne	390.5610
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said	127.2493
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions	57.4937
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	39.1697
i suffered that is all yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	430.2508
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the queen	98.6320
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached	147.8918
this time without knowing why dartagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins	216.7486
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti	62.1033
now you talk my dear you pardon me we shall see said porthos majestically and the two separated saying till this evening the devil thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenards strongbox at last chapter xxxv	115.9800
i am all attention said the abbé	10.4556
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage	135.6723
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse it is money to obtain which i made mazarin sweat	168.2690
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before meby and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home	130.5197
the poor girl under the caresses of dartagnan lifted her head	145.5100
i have heard that name in greece in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha exactly so this is the mystery said danglars	115.6952
it might be called a magnificent prison	835.4553
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched	198.4449
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or fiveandforty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the rd m ah said monte cristo the evening of the rd of june	105.1739

the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family	132.0894
you will describe it to me replied franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it	88.6300
crushed and impoverished by taxationimposed by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dustthe people as the advocategeneral talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur	381.7813
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the redtinted horizon	476.7591
villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities he then took villeforts arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantaintree where the shade was thickest	123.4334
you are discreetso much the better	13.8015
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest	171.8902
they ask my age i tell it	90.2915
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him	130.2771
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence	61.5307
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead	45.3646
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs but gentlemen i warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration people will come to the rescue ah my lord cried the gascon dont threaten tis a bad example	106.5009
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my childs room m do you wish to see him i only wish to be alone	55.0454
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	102.8073
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence	57.7932
deschamps i know him and for myselfi will write to you depend on me	97.8310
as to the key it had disappeared	33.7450
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time	65.8633
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep tonight madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction	104.7851
in a moment the whole party was assembled	449.9677
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king	97.2339
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear countwhen one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money	187.1077
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say	38.5003
kitty will conduct you to my chamber the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words	90.6172
mazarin leaned out of the window	70.9006
he bowed with great friendship to the count	11.7696
the _pharaon_ the _pharaon_ said every voice	84.5896
ah no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond	164.8934
yesyour friend at least hopes so come upstairs with me and i will give it to you i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile	41.7833
a sort of smile played on his lips	11.0826
what are you eating there porthos i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine do the same you are right	58.8084
dépinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m	254.9348
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large	87.0527
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	129.2227
grimaud alone was calm as ever	243.0588
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh	135.9394
bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door albert was used to the counts manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the counts orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house	56.1592
it is for me then to interrogate grimaud where is she asked athos	94.9852
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom	115.0466
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed	139.3856
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	51.7869
at that instant the little sidegate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared	135.1518
my name isah but surely you are monsieur dartagnan and thouplanchet cried the lieutenant	81.4870
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	199.1117
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend dartagnan formed a part	106.1155
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity	205.3544
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours	77.6958
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more	101.1381
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of dartagnan	57.8458
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair	195.7795
they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot	178.8934
darling replied valentine has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is summed up in two words _wait and hope_ fac et spera footnotes the wicked are great drinkers of water as the flood proved once for all in	437.8769
why did you leave the closet monsieur dartagnan asked the cardinal	104.9635
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	57.3398
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dantès knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor	157.9779
bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days	196.0580
i name only the most important you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these yes i speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greeki dont speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself improve yourself repeated dantès why how can you manage to do so why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium	122.8502
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de boisrobert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me i have no doubt of it said dartagnan	102.8068
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england	101.4163
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a smile	286.3004
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other	102.5234
let us break the carriage cried the people	57.2104
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results	67.8832
dartagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into dartagnans breast crying one for you and one for methe best for last cried dartagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body	99.3091
he opened the door quickly and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild	127.6171
what do you demand that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	331.4243
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition	240.3773
the total amount was found to be as m	25.3012
my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	105.1812
de villefort giving the key to davrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work	193.8670
it is my father who has just left his study to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel	94.7534
no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowlingpiece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude	201.2500
bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter	157.6408
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends	57.8279
oh let us speak frankly continued louvieres and act in a straightforward manner	157.8861
m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantlepiece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a lookingglass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him	88.9092
valentine hid her head between her hands	24.7636
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman a gentleman exclaimed athos	62.9870
pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me well said albert	45.7247
annes head was bent downshe had not seen the italians smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up	130.1297
my only fear is that he will be too strong for you my friend said morcerf with a sweet smile that is what i wish	34.0225
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil	215.5436
gentlemen said dartagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity	92.2396
i will not die alonei will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands	157.7071
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face	83.3280
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish	239.5600
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given dartagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared	84.5249
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no oneso much the worse that has naturally led me to love no oneso much the betternow you have my profession of faith then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal lovethen mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin your ruin	176.3927
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	82.9034
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked that is true sire there can be no more doubt on that head	91.4971
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our musicpaper	1914.4938
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer	88.5025
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions	326.7325
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative	922.7059
the papers said something about it did they not then you believe the papers inot the least in the world only i fancied that the honest _messager_ was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches well thats what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly francs this month not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss _diable_ said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a thirdrate fortune thirdrate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortunefirstrate secondrate and thirdrate fortunes	172.3934
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations indeed m	759.3661
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister	157.9895
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse	67.8311
dont make a bad use of it i entreat you	18.7541
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both	75.2365
yes said porthos but there are the equipments that is very true	69.7899
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards	114.6932
instead of that louisedo you understandair liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples	1865.9758
he likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar	47.0865
taste some of this ham dartagnan it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young mans plate	76.0722
here is a letter which must be taken to its address to its address my lord	120.3913
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is allpowerful even with the king he would crush you at a word	172.4221
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	113.6304
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my housedo you understand madame oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly	168.1128
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	94.2781
danglars trembled too morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this cannot be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartismi mean about the year yes replied m	172.6406
pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands listen madame said gondy	150.3917
it is he whom we must warn	98.6891
sir said he here is monsieur dartagnans answer but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos	52.2625
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen mazarin listened intently	212.8546
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with dartagnan when he was on duty	55.3074
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we cant fail to be beaten we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos	100.1925
in a corner was the spanish companion donna estafania who had followed her from madrid	906.7281
where do you suffer asked the doctor	19.2967
at about a league and a half from the city dartagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time	122.9604
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	183.5757
chevalier said the king when the door was closed i believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions	97.9840
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images	148.8788
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead	84.8512
what man is that cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive	262.3904
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerfs face	80.1780
bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king	72.9768
oh you know it tell them tell them and the young mans voice was choked by sobs	133.4112
has not some sage said nothing too much	43.8828
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them	149.2349
listen my dear girl said dartagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or other	119.0168
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	72.4208
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer youso much for the world	378.6097
courage take courage my dear mother said the girl	54.7865
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel	48.1976

in the morning milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her	87.8578
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five oclock in the morning	65.8763
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior	73.9808
take it from me when i amdead yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis	128.2153
dantès had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact tiboulen	51.2821
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them	306.2966
they breakfasted in haste and at six oclock had already gone ten miles	151.4034
then with a sigh poor haydée murmured he	52.9590
your holiness said gondy my friend you take me for some one else no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor i recognized you at the first glance gondy smiled	61.6829
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching miladys bed offered her services	108.8302
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just	99.4463
but at the very moment when dartagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m	38.4977
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton	63.2074

besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner	339.1011
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating	135.9376
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind	29.2756
ah cried dartagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it well merit this pretended happiness then i am at your orders said dartagnan	87.6068
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling	75.3513
where is the man who brought the letter in the street he awaits the answer yes i must learn where we are going	61.4271

i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits when you see one prisoner you see allalways the same thingill fed and innocent	957.2903
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket yes said dartagnan athos is right it must be burned	76.5683
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir say my highness is furious to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there	107.6614
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds	58.2186
ah these musketeers of yours are very devilsfellows to be hanged no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire ill be their warranty	189.4457
dartagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name	105.0316
yes sir replied the young man naively i felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in spanish from the enemys ranks i closed my eyes and thought of you in honest truth raoul said athos pressing his hand	100.9976
what the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of death	388.6916
he placed the young girl again on the chairher lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole faceand remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did	226.5734
who the beggar was that i killed ah indeed and who was he twas that low fellow bonacieux and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street	77.4209
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch	53.7507
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	173.5770
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment dartagnan entered	101.3744
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti	124.4260
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès	130.9747
tell me continued winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in france that henry iv the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with m	88.9592
this lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us	328.2697
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldnt have too much information	105.1698
that is forbidden it seems to me where forbidden asked mousqueton	83.4396
now he said are you in pain yes my head is not only swimming but burning whats the matter with this head said dartagnan raising the battered hat	157.8497
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his buttonhole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also	96.6856
so you suppose i have need of an escort	127.1909
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished two	219.8801
debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any	49.8263
let us to bed and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by dartagnan	40.9566

adieu thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him	52.0675
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance	272.0121
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather	191.4717
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	52.6691
there is still something else said he	18.3026
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything	127.7627
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge then you disapprove of duelling	190.1538
davrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m	118.1296
this short interval was sufficient to determine dartagnan on the part he was to take	46.2053
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says	67.2189
come you are no longer twenty years old to my great regret mordieu ah if i were but twenty years old yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies but now we must part	171.6552

porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword	39.5548
bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of aramis	36.8337
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	1420.6538
i dont believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin how well you reason said porthos admiringly	154.7588
by eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos	29.7924
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smellingsalts	66.1978
we have quitted business how long inquired the astonished merchant	203.1656
he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty	171.8458
to saddle gentlemen to saddle let us pursue him and we shall overtake him my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him	91.6835
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	159.7036
i could have drunk fifty bottles more dartagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered	150.2225
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of livingthat will signify but little that concerns god you and myself mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m	151.9952
mousqueton exclaimed dartagnan draw up the blinds of his majestys carriage it is he cried porthos	35.6870
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus grimaud however did not even smile	155.6355
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine do you want me to go away ah no no	54.2179

i am happy to see m	185.2269
at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop	41.6929
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	204.4819
in addition to this after a half hours conversation dartagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head	155.6921
today is the th of june yes well renew these bills up to the th of september and on the th of september at eleven oclock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money i shall expect you returned morrel and i will pay youor i shall be dead these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them	66.5112
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau	134.5040
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors	100.8004
the young man appeared on the threshold of the ministers closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter	47.3775

be it then as you desire	726.4219
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said dartagnan	111.5161
at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinals treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orangetree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came fromnot even the cardinal it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos	156.6629
if a man had by unheardof and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrotheda being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breastdo you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death	224.7812

dartagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion	170.7639
he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m	171.5365
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions	388.1576
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor	123.0203
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a question	216.1665
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top	188.5526
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow	270.6946

aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning	154.4551
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied dartagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host	97.2180
is he much changed he has become an abbé that is all you alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable soldier could you engage to bring him to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock on the pont du louvre oh oh exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which i hope you will take your part where are we to go my lord to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her this is an enigma said athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it i ask no further	66.8027

he had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay	103.7403
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the _bourgeoisie_ seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	190.1484
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom	369.5464

his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the yacht	141.3805

while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to alberts while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard	157.5248

dartagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunts hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance	126.2036

gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself	126.3667

but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters	56.5757
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	85.4464
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles	251.2178

everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle	235.6154

the cardinal folded and sealed his letter	10.5834
the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question	83.2382
and yet as you come from dax or pau from tarbes said dartagnan	1024.9634
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement	457.0915

bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedettos name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so	123.6536
and they pursued their road in mournful silence	444.5119
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview	86.4187

a part of the good abbés words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home	312.2350

at ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented	347.5855
edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flagstone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto	152.7455
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats chapter lxxvi	368.5166
dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed	42.0367
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm	85.6004
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on	83.4565
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	49.5978

it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	61.7218

at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times	39.1392
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel	35.4597
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage	165.7830

and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning	77.0855
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	47.8728
danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m	50.1257
the memory of richelieu annihilates me	1.0118
yes indeed count said madame danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina i was inspectorgeneral of the pashas troops replied morcerf and it is no secret that i owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief but look exclaimed madame danglars	154.8983
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statueyielding light without warmth	178.3276
a man whose name is franz dépinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda no he is a man about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a knittingneedle but he paid your ransom he said two words to the chief and i was free and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp	112.8885
the door at last opened albert de morcerf entered first and i began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed ah here is the baron franz dépinay i summoned all my strength and courage to my support	132.7088
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror	687.7169
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water	139.7072

this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as i think you told me dartagnan yes i know him very well and i also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sisterinlaw there is no harm in that	74.7630
morcerf and châteaurenaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission	42.1089
let me kill him we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine ifaith i dont know	96.9319
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away who told you that my dear asked milady	57.8462
i had no doubt he would return the following night	81.0503
this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play for unlike porthos who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost	115.6168
haydée is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocenceit is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called clairemarieeugénie had been named mademoiselle chastitymodestyinnocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression	156.2955
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	89.7923
every one likes his own uniform best my lord myself excepted and again mazarin smiled for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours lord bless us this is modesty indeed cried dartagnan	173.7769
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome	66.6612
a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake	181.3366
bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue the hôtel de la trémouille at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence	85.1574
pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellencys horses monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared	91.5462
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence who are they replied the duke	61.4820
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her	64.3345
the jailer always brought dantès soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first	238.3114
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line	330.4731
now my young friend said he england is all our own	99.1541
the latter had surpassed himself he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with monsieur de beauforts coatofarms	379.0244
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal yes and the queen too the queen do you say to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarins hands that famous diamondyou remember all about itthat i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i dont know how she has regained possession but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you so i think replied dartagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and youto whom are you devoted now to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf magnificent my dear fellow magnificent in the first place you have plenty of money havent you	107.9767
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparationsounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon	94.7861
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him	225.3545
monsieur de tréville awaits monsieur dartagnan cried a servant throwing open the door of the cabinet	26.8915
on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it	90.7694
do you wish for a notary asked villefort	312.2228
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep	163.7693
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room	83.3373
i have during those fiveandtwenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure	126.6415
nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clearsighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing	123.7206
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search	260.6138
de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush it is probable sire replied villefort	99.1964
a firm and wellpractised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond	84.4148
afraid of making any inquiries at this house dartagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras	67.9786
welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friends ransom that this had happened but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscounti do not see him nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly	91.1593
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès	130.3744
ah ah cried one of the guards will you persist in saying most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame de boistracy when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs aramis darted at dartagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy	96.1573
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife port	271.1080
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him he knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it by whom by me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information and what did you reply that i had none as yet but that i was to dine today with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some you told him that said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face	80.9319
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor villefort looked at the count almost with terror	80.6923
dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes but as we know dartagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections	132.8223
the queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her	144.0390
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to _écarté_it is not only a game it is a _horsdœuvre_ m	295.8743
tonight we stop at derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it	44.6429

yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture give me another cutlet no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens zounds what a flavor cried dartagnan ah they are fed on thyme only your hares and how do you like my wine asked porthos it is pleasant isnt it capital it is nothing however but a wine of the country really yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads quite a vineyard hey porthos sighed for the fifth timedartagnan had counted his sighs	294.1438
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen and he raised his cane six inches higher	111.9200
de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused	50.8649
it was five oclock in the afternoon i ascended into the red room and waited for night	80.9241
as to dartagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate	87.3158
you are a christian you are my sister in religion	97.0793
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreignersscotch irish or danish	242.3057
well dont you intend to bring me another plate said dantès	122.3276
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation	664.0990
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question	38.2868
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine chapter lii	254.4692
as to myself i shall go around to see athos for though i dont think his aid worth much one must with ones friends observe all due politeness said dartagnan	192.1078
oh my god my god cried milady when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance i pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that i implore do you know him then asked felton	103.0053
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	80.6576
you appear to be a brave young man besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen	75.1689
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples	394.9463
at four oclock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables	134.8731
pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abbé busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris not having seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait nay said danglars it is my fault i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you	77.9271
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes i had not dared to sleep a single instant	40.1091
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah ah exclaimed rochefort	52.9286
on recognizing her stepmother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed	93.2614
he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet	220.2956
i will send you to constantinople no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali the sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me you say very true responded debray	390.7128
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop	72.4928
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m	49.8811
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco had done over the moor who would have killed him	135.4897
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night scoundrel murmured felton	155.8489
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers go cornélie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer cornélie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray	106.6180
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle	74.6348
but to return to our millions certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world	66.3128
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly dartagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos	144.9652
you will not sign that order my lord said felton making a step toward the duke	63.2955
the abbé busoni repeated caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count	26.4540
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	18.4116
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare	1774.8701
we are lost said dartagnan in the ear of athos	26.1692
at eight oclock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that dartagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow	60.6305
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds	157.5070
this room was occupied by dantès father	1671.2507
i really must pray you to excuse me butin truthi was not attending to the conversation marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on ones wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m	207.6363
but stop let me look at that sapphire again the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident dartagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos	119.7141
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the nevervarying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming	101.0384
how much in that little bag seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs seven thousand livres cried porthos	141.7241
my dear albert said he let me introduce to you m	82.1752
but dont let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your masters orders	95.7550
and moreover my dear child continued dartagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian i do not understand you sir said raoul	40.2884
around a brokendown carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisonersthat is to say an old man and two women	126.9595
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for fourandtwenty hours	195.5830
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all	91.9797
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos	13.6138
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the _pharaon_	64.5980
troops five or six thousand men courage plenty then the thing is easy	172.7733
all this must be prepared against	518.3828
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	188.3211
the yard was empty the clock was striking twelve	363.5598
she would have taken dartagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache	243.2130
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him	93.0104
sir said he up to this timeand it is now more than fourandtwenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for fiveandthirty yearsnever has anything bearing the signature of morrel son been dishonored i know that replied the englishman	163.4088
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghostfor he trod so softly that no sound was heardthen poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it	242.6802
now we are on the very road which all the vessels between dover and calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north that said athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis	144.9137
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you	280.5043
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine	221.4774
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres	132.8329
jewels diamonds gems that i alone	1570.7031
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father	144.6737
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you	190.7794
i tell you the queen does not love me i tell you she loves another i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham why did you not have him arrested while in paris arrest the duke arrest the prime minister of king charles i think of it sire what a scandal and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii	98.7857
athos was happyhappy as he had never been before	20.7784
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment	46.6536
ah you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible	139.8588
you must take grimaud and olivain both sir asked raoul astonished	269.8516
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes planchet began to sing un vent de fronde sest leve ce matin je crois quil gronde contre le mazarin	569.1244
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied dartagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn	85.8133
at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal	169.1554
and madame de morcerf to your dinner i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good why so because it is the air she always breathed in her youth monte cristo took no notice of this illnatured remark	109.1140
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercédès	218.5514
do you perchance think i set any great store by life there is something horribly mysterious under all this athos this woman is one of the cardinals spies i am sure of that in that case take care if the cardinal does not hold you in high admiration for the affair of london he entertains a great hatred for you but as considering everything he cannot accuse you openly and as hatred must be satisfied particularly when its a cardinals hatred take care of yourself	110.2967
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friendnot here at least	233.5073
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fishpond ah that is where the art comes in	180.8112
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened	76.9333
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion	474.2724
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beatthe child was dead	123.2374
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god	118.7188
but since you possess that virtue why the devil dont you make use of it with respect to her majesty	47.8541
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry and i am so still said porthos bowing to harrison	109.9739
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility	673.3470
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned	124.2663
the poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter	123.8561
tis he murmured winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side	48.4274
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something but why mother just to please me albert said mercédès	337.8559
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained fortyeight hours without eating or drinking	183.4344
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me	107.7055
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness	183.4139
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his eye was calm and even brilliant	65.2036
m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down	113.9862
it is closed after them and they are arrested so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the _habitués_ of the establishment	87.0711
why the devil a horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy dartagnan did not smile	347.2011
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs	63.7097
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets	726.2279
milady had likewise the best of passportsher beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles	362.2762
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor	399.6681
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was oldfashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated	130.2530
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion	92.6444
i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel	139.0952
he was a man of twentyfive or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coatlining	127.9400
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied bazin	136.9883
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spadas letter written on the wall in characters of flameif he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain	551.3994
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold	140.7454
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edwards room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villeforts apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor	79.4769
the very madness of the abbé faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity	253.6622
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercédès nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet	148.1062
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration	122.5258
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it	107.9226
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were	179.8329
come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want	84.2416
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the first	48.3077
it is francs which i now owe you said monte cristo	34.8605
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise and something must follow	289.8013
interrogate me i entreat you where is your wife in the first place why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me yes but yesterday at five oclock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped my wife escaped cried bonacieux	62.3972
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes repeated	238.7200
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence	3436.0454
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air	82.6676
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you thats well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him	59.9019
what do you mean other men may have entered before them and waited for them we can find out said grimaud	80.0105
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort	70.9718
de villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded evil	3372.0422
bertuccio the steward appeared at the door	4.2270
do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing	108.1303
but dartagnan had reckoned without the wind	65.2746
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminences guardsmen had received	196.3788
impossible that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret well what is to be done if monsieur chevalier would follow me said kitty timidly	120.5014
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brotherinlaw another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france m valentine trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks	90.1098
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercédès is not accountable to any person is she	100.6418
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone	251.7529
will you not even say you will see me again he asked	55.2319
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said dartagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you dartagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis	81.4828
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously	65.2402
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner	106.4290
but dont think yourselves in a better position than you are	75.2948
the day was passed at saint peters alone	1156.6798
ah i shall know how to make you leave your home replied albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which monte cristo did not lose sight of	74.0278
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers	175.9800
it was a mistake yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the ministers secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me francs but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m	171.2953
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg work	12.4866

the house of morrel son chapter	156.6686
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars	30.1868
i wish you to do so said he	11.4016
my friend you impose a painful task on me	88.5575
to undermine the ground for fifty feetto devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the seato plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shorewere difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death	158.1034
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you why i think there were not many intruders	137.7156
i was not rich my life was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret the president frowned imperceptibly	189.5906
the exclamations the insults addressed to benedetto who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbanceall this lasted five minutes before the doorkeepers and magistrates were able to restore silence	157.0189
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel	50.1919
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the rapier nor i either so much the better that sets my mind at rest	112.5440
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl	25.1175
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating	316.1556
theyre after me was andreas first thought	189.5683
hair sandyredmore red than sandy grayblue eyesmore gray than blue and for the rest stiff and proud let him give in his letter his eminence asks for the letter said bernouin passing back into the antechamber	170.1968
de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home	37.0811
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance	131.4964
his costume of guardsman in the company of m	16.6661
well when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say hes a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master by jove i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living athos was for a few moments thoughtful	213.4886
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet	45.0677
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so	134.9873
it was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently beloved	129.6059
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs	142.2781
it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance	85.6038
_pardieu_ and what do they say of it in the world in which world	49.3201
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette	393.2599
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven	155.3474
the womans hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face	17.0372
the four countenances expressed four different feelings that of porthos tranquillity that of dartagnan hope that of aramis uneasiness that of athos carelessness	238.3694
this would have been a method of reckoning time had not dantès long ceased to do so	139.7219
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_ who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	165.3707
well over that coachhouse are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments ah _diable_ bells did you say what do you mean oh nothing i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at auteuil to that you went to you know yes i was saying to him only yesterday you are imprudent monsieur count for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected well said he what next well next some day you will be robbed what did he answer he quietly said what do i care if i am andrea he has some secretaire with a spring how do you know yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune	117.0764
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled	115.6243
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentinelive to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me command me sirwhat am i to do you must blindly take what i give you alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die you must not confide in anyonenot even in your father my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her hands	110.9039
elssler was dancing in _le diable boiteux_ the greek princess was in ecstasies	820.6603
with discretion dartagnan remained behind but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold he turned round and seeing the hesitation of the young man come in cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majestys presence tell her what you have seen encouraged by this invitation dartagnan followed the duke who closed the door after them	59.0400
we have only the vulture to deal with	37.0229
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said dartagnan and share the three hundred we will share said porthos	101.4028

the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed	108.2429
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine	107.0962
i am as certain of it as that we two are christians the abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him halffull swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks	177.6198
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known no for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they were	180.2696

he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthosthat is to say exactly upon the baldric	172.3749
de tréville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend you will do me honor monsieur said dartagnan	79.6115

these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army	124.6783
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction	31.8060

noirtier that is it said the old mans eye	32.5151

de tréville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my roadporthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m	99.7122
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone no my lord replied the impassive young man your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me in that case my brave lieutenant let us leave milady to find out something else and go to supper but be easy she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing	135.2115
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people	64.2383
i promised to come said felton and i have come you promised me something else what my god said the young man who in spite of his selfcommand felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow	50.7952
go to the devil you do not know with whom you have to deal m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl	61.3299
it must have lost its ferocity in the second generation	553.6111
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris	67.3203
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	98.4046
the answer known he had yielded to alberts wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydées recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerfs father	114.9137
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery	86.7512
we have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners there could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received dartagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwells health	82.6054
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does	77.0622
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity	93.2746
he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little mme	195.0819
can they have received any news my lord not from england madame	130.8784
ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag	74.9931
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight	80.8817
danglars m sir replied danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog i kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness	89.1510
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string	249.5636
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed	173.3747
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist	90.1923
the night monte cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous _suivezmoi_ then he rose and went out	257.2316
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers i regard them as invaluable now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety	41.3490
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his threecornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons	513.5120
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired	75.2893
in a moment they were at the canebière	811.9177
you must not stop an instant on the way	32.8723
however promise me one thing what is it promise me i say i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is	116.1294
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	71.3366
i come for your commands my lord he said	20.6242
for tell me where can you find a love like minea love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word	254.9606
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one	62.9471
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do	37.3690
he made his way along the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture	302.9862
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern	445.4338
let us go to breakfast i shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry yes said porthos my air is excellent they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt	129.7365
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you yes and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison noirtiers joy continued	174.1229
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself	76.9180
monte cristo ran down the steps and advancing towards the spot designated beheld villefort encircled by his servants with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with fury	105.7874
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtiers breathing came thick and short	236.6972
in the name of heaven duke leave me go i do not know whether i love you or love you not but what i know is that i will not be perjured	77.3198
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned miladys neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly	323.0707
come collect yourself and tell me all i have related it but once and that was to the abbé busoni	33.1121
he had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine	199.4367
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressingroom	391.4731
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord in the most simple and natural manner possible	166.5027
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive	131.9222
if i am free why these bars and these doors	1228.0901
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet	90.9154
de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers	128.7769
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock	100.0114
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village _armentières_ read porthos armentières	307.8470
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument are you mad la ramee	106.0392
we are no longer in the middle ages there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these people	121.1681
what i mean to say is this sirthat during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting a play yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other that is quite my desire you have seen m	139.4487
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knowsdartagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	130.9436
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary	58.6370
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable enough	141.6354
de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline	492.5709
the man whipped his animals which cleared a way through the crowd but on arriving on the quai they were obliged to stop the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd	109.3243
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation	48.3497
after which the cardinal who had been informed that dartagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke	74.2881
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare	124.4218
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the place royale by the duc de guise	88.1806
are we not their majesties servants at that moment porthos entered	88.0406
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not whollynot for conscience sake but through fear	126.7025
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlés or fossins shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure worldling murmured the count	144.6535
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark	92.3511
the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery	96.2853
i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged ah so much the better exclaimed the king	114.6907
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall	188.5686
bonacieux whom dartagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him	46.0298
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that cannot be described	75.1677
then bring some wine said dartagnan	10.2195
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum	207.0402
the blood had mounted to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis	46.1979
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen the king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and i must give it for them	64.4818
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily	376.3628
de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit	414.6621
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me they are no robbers but assassins	101.3442
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing dartagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained him	140.8069
did you ever suffer from a strain athos never though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos said aramis	89.5256
de wardes that provoked her thus	1882.4600
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea you love me yes i do or may the devil take me	53.5538
i sought out the best fencing master in paris i made an agreement with him to take a lesson every day and every day for a year i took that lesson	82.6592
stay where you are i will go myself and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground dartagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier	76.2299
go on my child said the count in the romaic language	70.9525
now said the old man aid me to bury my child carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose	111.9982
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m	49.9734
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fishpond	476.4232
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel	80.8487
what were you doing in the battle my friend inquired athos of the youth twas not your right place i think as you were not equipped for an engagement i had no intention of fighting today sir i was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for rueil when seeing monsieur de chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side	107.5452
besides it came into the young mans mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair	122.1826
have you something to tell me asked he	19.3550
is he at home yes monsieur said mousqueton but in a very ill humor	127.9206
ah ah a bruise yes i think i received a flowerpot upon my head brutes said dartagnan	182.5962
monsieur abbé you are a great moralist doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos	141.3944
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her	152.3963
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesemmanuel herbaut monte cristo smiled imperceptibly	789.0523
from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh	1000.4064
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate	123.9797
as for porthoss coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two	184.0834
what do you see a troop of how many persons twenty men what sort of men sixteen pioneers four soldiers how far distant five hundred paces good we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health dartagnan to your health repeated porthos and aramis	124.0367
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand	113.6242
oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross kneebreeches and how shall i be dressed demanded andrea	213.9648
the regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct	162.7030
ah confound it yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling	159.3841
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing hush said athos we are overheard in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	109.2635
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy	238.5793
i am free replied maximilian and rich enough to support you	56.8176
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal	10.3359
well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos	68.8127
de villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless how useless cried the president what do you mean i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me	98.5968
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	79.3670
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives but what is that to me provided i see you again all this is perhaps follyperhaps insanity but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love what queen a servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly	140.0875
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted	838.6351
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse	25.1268
ere long marseilles presented herself to viewmarseilles white fervid full of life and energymarseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterraneanmarseilles old yet always young	497.3831
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation i did not sleep well you raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said athos	103.2470
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis	48.2014
one was the notarys the other that of franz and his friends	112.0004
raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand	115.6439
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	277.6219
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid	133.6501
oh i repeat it edmond what you have just done is beautifulit is grand it is sublime do you say so now mercédèsthen what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you	104.0549
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspiresis not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon	201.7295
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy	97.0115
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions	308.5667
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the halfpike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory	86.4190
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris write to him nows the time you are sure of your enterprise yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them	78.4921
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly	136.8956
cavalcanti i do not know him viscount you do not know him no i never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him but you receive him at your house that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbé who may be deceived	63.3980
the bastion saintgervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends dartagnan found them assembled in the same chamber	47.0362
he was a man about twentytwo or twentythree years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises	758.1208
it must be done said athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added	155.4326
your excellencies permit it asked the host	8.7432
then you will lie here said dartagnan	7.9785
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one	129.1508
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo and who is beppo oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle indeed you are a provident person i see why you see no one knows what may happen	83.1904
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room	48.7415
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the barons right hand with his left and held out his other hand	142.7712
whose is the ocean upon which we look	52.4564
i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at romethere he said throwing a louis down	340.8625
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head	40.6542
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie	139.4189
but that is not a mans name that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his head	77.7591
what do you mean by that nothing my lord monsieur dartagnan belongs to the service monsieur dartagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs you are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city tis that exactly	104.5934
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties dartagnan would become the preserver of his friends	119.1121
gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good christians egad said dartagnan by heaven yes we should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said aramis	104.5480
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give you dartagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	68.3265

he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles th february delivery oclock but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be	106.7635

she knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by buckinghamand buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in questiononce this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors	248.0296
this woman passed for his sister	555.2198
we shall wait for you dartagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him	52.3114
at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle	215.1146
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal	205.6030
what does this mean demanded he of the cardinal	20.7534

_my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg_ good _the luxembourg_ one might believe this is an allusion to the queenmother thats ingenious said athos	392.8299

he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated th april in which morrel by the deputy procureurs advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial causeservices which villeforts certificates rendered indisputable	185.8389
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not certainly said morrel i am at your service count still what it is desirable i should know the real cause that is to say you would rather not no the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side enough said morrel who is your second witness i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel	89.6749
in gods name answer me he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering	60.2820
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared	146.4260
he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within	113.4037
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of _my friends_this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myselfthis young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger why did you not tell me all thisyou inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look	94.6114
well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness	183.9182
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali	137.7806
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door	74.8458
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance	67.1631
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	55.6628
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention	153.8331
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe i ought rather to say what i know what you know and even what i am sure of and of what are you so sure i would say that i know this great lady you yes i and how do you know her oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion speak by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things what have you done oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor well monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post	79.8958
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven oclock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen	120.5020
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are i rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saintméran insist that m	165.7713
do you wish for any further details	494.7292
he decided then to tell all	100.5019
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart	45.6797
one ball struck the head of the alreadywounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of dartagnan	150.6883
to what do you allude monsieur said danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the generals words	58.3817
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity	97.9273
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary	44.7281
it was indeed for him that they were there	58.6259
second porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh as the englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage	81.6905
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls	151.8108
my fault said he you must be mad what do i know of the grecian affair	62.3742
the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass	42.4018
how pale you are no but i have just met with a terrible adventure are you alone athos _parbleu_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and dartagnan rushed into athoss chamber	78.4597
if he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost	305.1940
each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passersby through this egyptian scene with its strident monotonous note	3059.8704
and you porthos i agree to it too said porthos if dartagnan approves of it	97.0814
he has at the request of your father opened an account of francs a month at m	56.9057
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situatedneither too near paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility	227.4345
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man	70.1596
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tigercat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers	116.3518
an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the _lives of the saints_ to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced	169.2236
rochefort had returned to the chevalier dhumieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call	1111.2061
perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison briefly what did you learn that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two oclock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals	194.2295
patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be	147.4805
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the counts blue coat	99.7395
and here is andrea cavalcantis baptismal register given by the curé of saravezza all quite correct take these documents then they do not concern me	234.0385
can we do anything for you asked athos	37.5771
oh god be praised he said it is a real bed this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god	57.5577
what do i see that he wouldnt swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldnt swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers	102.0292
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still	89.9099
de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him	52.5891
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men dofor i tell you you must not count on monsieur dartagnan it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall	136.0405
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me	48.9895
avast there all hands take in the studdingsails and stow the flying jib it was time the squall was on us and the vessel began to heel	197.4419
goodby oh by the way youd better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote	1458.4119
he converted his chamber into an observatory	4998.8252
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself	59.9603
yes buckingham the woman was english then no she was french but she had married in england the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door	77.2837
ah here is one of them i believe in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared	59.6050
what can he be looking for thought edmond	312.9038
what do you intend doing valentine held down her head she was overwhelmed	96.2331
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetitegriefand as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not thatand love	179.2268
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content	225.9569
doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die i am content to suffer and to await death beware said m	188.1675
do you require my services now asked davrigny	364.8449
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved	795.7208
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it	127.5393
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily pineapples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis	1121.4796
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	196.7824
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment	89.2195
what vessel is that asked milady	132.9466
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject	120.8781
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais	60.4184
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	60.6789
well tempter what more do you want with me said dartagnan	23.7271
i am an officer of fortune nothing else i have nothing but what my sword brings me inthat is to say more blows than banknotes	245.2248
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight	133.4275
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance	243.5807
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water	125.8471
the cold sweat sprang forth on dantès brow	13.1410
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis	32.5683
alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter mademoiselle danglars eugénie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count	97.3307
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child oh curses woe death to you he tried to follow monte cristo but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spothis eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire	222.3542
endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether _we_ return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not my child returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flowerthe flower falls from the tree my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young my father had a long white beard but i loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life shall i see you every day then what do you fear my lord you might find it dull no my lord	94.0662
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience	472.6827
we must leave you said monte cristo	6.2385
what said cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish	55.7802
i must take care chapter xxxvii	8610.7871
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest	252.3719
dartagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m	114.1965
morrel said dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service	153.9479
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m	45.2434
i own that this woman terrifies me shall you have the courage said athos	69.5835
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching	135.4252
on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peters which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable	170.3401
athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen bonacieux undergo	761.5555
on the contrary we shall meet again said mercédès pointing to heaven with solemnity	82.3193
but i think i have it said athos	61.8745
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be a man women weep for the dead men avenge them oh yes cried dartagnan yes if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior	71.0287
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball	155.8274
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan _thank you be easy_	694.4945
de boville the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest	155.3416
if i ever find him againand i will find him i swear were it in hell he was waiting for a woman continued tréville	109.3874
and you are happy he said to his friend	53.4437
answer for i have many things to tell you too indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happenedbut what is the matter	132.6550
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmonds skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	156.9699
dartagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed	79.3759
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration_utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_ dartagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m	220.3813
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly	50140.1562
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant yes well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you certainly	124.5513
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so	16.0399
he could not see it but he _felt_ its presence	1629.6274
one has never the last word with such a man	133.9180
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities	179.3475
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same story	55.5957
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house	154.8579
benedetto he muttered fatality halfpast six oclock has just struck m	41.1321
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	201.2485
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness	74.9851
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income	46.7334
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master	68.4676
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass it had disappeared	102.4875
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably	271.9041
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba nobody somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it i think yes the grand marshal did and what did you do with that letter put it into my portfolio you had your portfolio with you then	120.2075
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed	178.8533
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment	92.3260
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother	97.7926
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian	757.5686
dartagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed	104.8201
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies	199.8442
what an injustice my dear invalid i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say	74.2327
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness	207.6274
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which dartagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	109.3713
upon this promise dartagnan withdrew and the next day he began service	52.9303
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little progress	238.7968
as for me i can only repeat may god protect you and all dear to you sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin the host was at his door and everything was preparedbed bandages and lint and a groom had gone to lens the nearest village for a doctor	129.8377
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech	57.7042
i shall kill himi cannot help it	43.7391
he opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon	201.9512
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it	108.9115
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages nay indeed your excellency i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin but let your profits end here	161.3467
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter	50.2110
the lieutenants entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawingroom but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water	73.5672
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit	89.7496
she is very amiable then is she not said albert	57.7480
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely	240.4250
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy some i shall displease others	217.9606
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation	195.5169
now in the opinion of dartagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off mme	81.5989
you do not know the italian nobility the cavalcanti are all descended from princes have they any fortune an enormous one what do they do try to spend it all	202.2098
he continued so i was going away but he called me back	62.0149
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense	139.5679
he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited	89.9438
the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood	179.3578
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest	120.8916
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing	139.1431
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine upon my word the drum draws near said dartagnan	121.7566
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abbé smiled	92.3772
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment	278.6161
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again	141.5957
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep	277.6867
good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door	60.9407
we shall be safer there than in the doorway ah my god whispered mme	94.9397
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another steplong live the emperor said the figure	268.6736
you shall relate them to me my child	23.0761
in that case we are as well off as we wish and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about silence porthos said aramis	121.2895
is that what you would say he has some but he is very avaricious that is his fault	90.2062
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters arrest	55.8345
you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable what must i do to attain such sublimity you are today free as aircome and dine with me we shall be a small partyonly yourself my mother and i	146.1641
noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference is it a suitable match in every respect and the young man is regarded with universal esteem you approve of him he is one of the most wellbred young men i know during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent	92.5330
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalierthat she found this cavalierand that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer	116.3183
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind franz smiled an instant after the count entered	64.8436
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother ah excuse me then said dartagnan	96.1790
noirtier evidently intends making me his heir	111.2254
do you know his house at auteuil certainly what do you know respecting it do you wish to know why he bought it yes the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments	141.0098
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime who said it was a crime asked villefort with a last effort	124.9065
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent	109.6904
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts	90.6786
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction	424.7711
the soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages	130.5149
danglars fancied that they had reached the longdesired point he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows	131.2662
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors	456.8076
and i say that murders _are_ committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months	243.5701
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy	63.0812
i would take the hundred pistoles	14.9258

ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old mans debts and buried him decently and so edmonds father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone	92.2891
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the window	55.4902
the devil take you said aramis	20.4612
ali had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the gates of st sebastian	121.0178
tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety	63.8592
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur when you please said dartagnan	53.1821
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus i came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your life i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have and if i make a promise i must keep it well said felton only promise till you have seen me again	70.4505
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake	500.7371
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself wellnigh recovered	150.4465
and you will tell him i will publish the report of boisrobert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade	118.7638
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him	252.2004
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead	60.7173
yes he murmuredyes be satisfied his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study	112.6251
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	78.5177
for the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable fidelity	2187.1641
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow	81.8396
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out	77.5973
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity	327.4102
besides dartagnan passed the evening with me well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with a brow flushed with anger	85.4981
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mobnot a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarins witticisms or by the jests of the multitudeseemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place	331.0453
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament	202.8675
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger go then sir and god keep you the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the anterooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishops palace	128.6297
what is it asked dartagnan who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his friend	54.4181
that is true said dartagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis	53.2448
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm	118.2314
m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtiers room	150.6328
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many wellknown faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant	106.0242
morrels wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened	142.2065
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting manfred	152.1226
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	156.3295
she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard all	78.3886
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune dartagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he dartagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england	191.1510
yes said athos by his own nephew come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said dartagnan	88.1029
on the contrary i gave you to understand i think that i adhered to the princes	101.1001
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage	306.4579
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation	107.7297
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits	307.3802
de tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the point	45.9296
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st paul or of the place de grêve it was at the traitors cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him	102.7318
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	62.9721
de morcerf will accompany me bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travellingcarriage would arrive at six oclock	146.7444
let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage you speak charmingly said porthos	287.5661
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine	154.5932
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables comminges glanced at dartagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up	124.1224
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition	148.3273
at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercédès at the second he reminded her that he loved her	64.8263
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard	109.0283
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	82.2615
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination	149.3956
this movement revealed the spot where winters body had fallen	154.7953
dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	93.3270
on him on him always on him yes you are right maximilian i will follow you	52.0874
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	98.9978
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them	291.7803
so much the worse so much the worse_diavolo_ as they say in my country reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing poverty pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a bakers door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited	169.2625
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledgehammer	137.5575
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping milady reseated herself foaming	539.1929
then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest	89.0685
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction	75.0763
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile	167.7398
patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london	85.3666
during the darkness as before my supper was brought	183.6112
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation	89.0789
but now her position in life is assured continued caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused	211.7191
grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out	197.0501
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed	78.3303
andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	199.7074
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer perhaps you like repose she said	102.6244
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris	51.1466
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern	87.8048
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	110.9834
the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m	35.4432
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollectionthe conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saintmérans death recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois	149.5241
the valet de chambre announced m	43.4967
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	187.4281
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered	1774.8718
you have not forgotten st gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto	154.9432
this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great door	59.0898
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him	61.5924
why does not he go about his business stupid fellow yourself said dartagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window	88.9718
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	97.8557
he is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the baron danglars with a fine residence in the rue du montblanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and i know not how many millions in his strongbox ah said the abbé in a peculiar tone he is happy happy	69.1613
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the newcomer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit	161.8041
my dear albert said debray rising it is halfpast two	38.4424
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the strangers face while his own remained obscured	131.3215
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	43.4563
she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m	111.6849
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch	153.8770
his delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency	352.0341
the woman is an agent of the cardinal he has agents then throughout the world cried dartagnan	84.6528
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into lifevalentine the daughter by my first wifemademoiselle renée de saintméranand edward the boy whose life you have this day saved and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo	243.4599
we are going to rejoin that good fellow porthos	78.8068
let us dispatch said the duke	17.8465
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifes room nothing is changed here he then closed the door of the landing	101.8364
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome	278.9175
i really believe you are a man and a violent one too and you you are a womana miserable woman stupid and brutal	217.4603
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious	227.8862
de winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed all	198.4170
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing dartagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying i am not calumniating you my friend	135.1219
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	98.7666
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson french had come to her fathers related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter	70.9950
what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort	140.7689
take it said she and be accursed athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec	127.9998
you are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you	69.9146
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	216.9935
bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast	133.9598
the two men were left alone	117.7840
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort	61.7307
we hastened therefore to obtain permission to print it with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others at the doors of the académie des inscriptions et belles lettres if we should not succeeda very probable thing by the byin gaining admission to the académie française with our own proper pack	363.5027
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque headdress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	84.1654
let us go in said monte cristo	7.2872
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection and how many hours of reflection do you ask twelve hours sir is it too long it is now noon at midnight i will be at your house if i should not be in wait for me good at midnight my lord at midnight my dear monsieur louvieres when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house	78.6015
as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at portoferrajo yes most satisfactory my dear danglars well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much	78.6360
come dartagnan said porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds to bracieux or to du vallon	170.1169
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but today is not the proper time today flatter and caress or you are only a common woman at the first words of this address dartagnan had seized porthoss arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force	81.5687
oh yes perfectly safe and sound my good host and i wish to know what has become of our young man he is better said the host he fainted quite away indeed said the gentleman	64.5418
the fool the ass the idiot how so if he loved her asked dartagnan	141.4123
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner	37.6007
the departure for belgium a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m	45.0227
_morbleu_ monsieur said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you perhaps said athos	69.3709
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune	93.8640
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend	17.3720
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors	312.9171
art thou dumb cried the duke	13.3859
let me see have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape	212.6424
did you know that no monseigneur	1918.2322
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m	100.9689
help to put me on the bed i think i shall feel better there have you any one to depend on for assistance my wife is at durham and may return at any moment	143.6296
the enemys army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them	222.4205
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project	188.6136
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society	394.8691
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before	97.5810
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres it appears so said athos since here they are	61.4191
cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf	58.8874
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars	169.7327
parliament can never have passed such an act as that at this moment the landlord came in	65.1340
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy	213.3872
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage	100.0125
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children	123.2035
and now said dartagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos	46.4056
de saintméran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	282.7785
ah _parbleu_ thats good said albert with a gloomy tone	32.0959
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as ninetenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step	150.0337
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began	123.8979
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a drought come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration	204.0148
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours countyou who are the very flower of our nobilityto squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists really count if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you	257.3489
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am he said to himself	50.3416
give it to me the captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air	150.5086
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things what did you please to say sir asked caderousse	69.1286
behold nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant	92.9017
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weaknessa weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance	155.3363
more pale and menacing than athos dartagnan stood on the threshold	69.6936
i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do tis well arise vicomte embrace me raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the counts arms	117.6007
dartagnans friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract	44.5818
villefort rose and ran towards his motherinlaw for it was she	88.4683
this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome	37.9373
now said the steward what have you to tell me and you said andrea	26.0849
i called on fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valetdechambre then you did not see either of them no but madame de morcerf saw me how was that as i went away a purse fell at my feetit contained fiveandtwenty louis i raised my head quickly and saw mercédès who at once shut the blind and m	128.0303
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	872.3304
no one at villeforts doubted that a duel would ensue from it	122.1639
morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting	121.0507
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour	26.5044
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable and do you not remember the frenchmans name said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator	79.2265
let us not talk about money if you please it is humiliating then you no longer love me said the procurators wife slowly and sadly	68.9692
ifaith said dartagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand	79.4007
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing dartagnan on the coachbox of the royal coach	158.0349
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather	123.4826
groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company all four of us asked athos	69.8613
what are these things he asked	204.1640
where do your excellencies wish to go asked he	26.4504
a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead	126.8204
_one_ said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death	104.4826
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood	220.7917
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	79.2479
punctuality you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was halfpast has the ministry resigned no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us ah true you drive don carlos out of spain no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans	126.0548
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand	138.6645
athos was pale and trembled in every limb	367.6561
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity	519.6115
has he built one here then no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise both the deuceand what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	137.7091
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view	261.9123
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of dartagnan	18.4297
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked gondy	44.4692
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther	224.1124
the door immediately closed and dartagnan found himself again in complete obscurity	309.7365
he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office	128.6322
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself	123.8325
is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence	115.8391
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum	266.1073
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed	73.4423
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence i thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly	71.0660

your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand	73.3154
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill	178.4696
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform i declare i expect to look magnificent in it and chose that regiment only from vanity mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son	156.6515
now to the work i have in hand and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed	68.9808
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand	92.5367
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone	159.9701
what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the saintemarguérite islands	657.8842
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat	79.8115
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter	113.1008
four in the kings room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered	64.8055
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright	125.8578
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing dartagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger	85.5721
they threw themselves into each others arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house	192.0625
danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himselfhalfmalicious halfferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame	107.3251
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned never mind ill fix that all right	141.2504
bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille	156.8426
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice my advice is this said monsieur darminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat	64.5968
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal then i must wait here or in the neighborhood only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here why you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute thats true but is this little woman then to escape his eminence bah said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am her best friend ah thats true i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease is that all he will know what that means he will guess at least	79.0254
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son	87.0788
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but im choked	574.9332
did you send this wine aramis said athos	88.1319
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions	144.0062
the evening arrived all paris was in expectation	103.4167
to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silenceunbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above	161.1488
gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor	156.3827
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder i am dying help reverend sirhelp this mournful appeal pierced the darkness	184.1091
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door	16.1270
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dantès you make me shudder	109.6357
yes madame replied the coadjutor i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced	158.9801
we must understand each other said the duke	19.3314
do you place confidence in our landlordmonsieur bonacieux i	4902.3638
oh beautiful life yes we are young yes we shall yet have happy days my love my blood my life all all all are thine my adored mistress and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table	159.4395
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient	78.0940
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope	33.4298
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat	62.7286
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me i only supposed it must be seven or eight oclock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark	52.3370
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall	49.2842
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention	153.8049
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	182.5677
seven oclock said grimaud who had not spoken a word	37.6491
and you porthos faith i am going to fightbecause i am going to fight answered porthos reddening	138.5704
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	124.0309
caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort oh my god my god said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed mans father in heaven and his judge on earth	64.8821
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned yes do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him no do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine yes then will she die too asked davrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier	139.1696
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	2101.3120
he pushed through the crowd approached athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber	134.9572
he had good cause to do so the pain i gave him must have been atrocious	162.7754
by his manner sir and his age hes the second today has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then asked raoul	109.3408
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge	180.6477
i shall follow the counts directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out	92.5267
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger	84.8276
villefort retired to his study and davrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead m	112.0680
matters go but badly said athos smiling and we shall not be made chevaliers of the order this time wait here ten minutes said m	98.7255
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion indiscretionoh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject	251.1203
do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us	63.1851
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palaiscardinal and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to him	49.5645
unhappily those times are past nonsense they will return said dartagnan	120.2619
dartagnan approached her with his usual gallantry	3995.3931
they halted for the king to dine	94.1889
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed	171.5168
my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your eminence orders an escalade but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal	85.7202
but what can i do for you then dartagnan told m	139.6331
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service madame replied dartagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majestys service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you i know that sir i have known that said the queen a long time therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem permit me madame said dartagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done wonders his name asked the queen	76.2794
this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate	68.9327
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered	186.4184
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him	116.8219
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charmsshe had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers	547.0750
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo	51.4563
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	120.8576
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial	72.9004
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant	431.5681
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman	180.3358
de villeforts house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnuttrees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance	248.4158
at the noise made by dartagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world	57.7397
let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned	77.0229
the chancellor sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel do that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the bishop of meaux	169.7699
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his armchair	85.4360
once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction	357.1593
oh oh that is a large sum	959.9803
come come madame cried dartagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	112.2331
then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydée is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes because my lord said haydée eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to knowhow she had become the slave of the count	108.5608
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house	46.2927
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athoss chamber and that of the park	104.9466
go and call out your regiment said he i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on	54.6307
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit	185.3024
m but at least you will be there will all paris be there oh certainly well like all paris i shall be there too said the count	84.0979
the days of expectation are long and dartagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour hours	626.6593
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward	117.4143
yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly	104.0945
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i	96.3080
proud of this exploit vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm	98.4154
it is nearly eight oclock and at nine i expect a visit	94.2099
i dont comprehend you dont comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me which of my friends my lord your three friendsthe friends of former days of former days my lord in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty at twoandtwenty one calls every man ones friend well sir returned mazarin prudence is a fine thing but today you might regret having been too prudent my lord pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues but you have been silent for twenty years sir	138.2492
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart	148.8574
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving dartagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern	98.5094
it is true i fought with tolerable success i dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others dartagnan pretended astonishment	243.9807
ah mazarin mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction	92.8946
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos	35.6974
this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false positionplaced between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birdswas in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a womans caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest	247.1513
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house	119.6382
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead dead dead cried patrick	77.7761
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at romei who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist _par excellence_ for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage	274.7142
each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty	461.5919
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion	160.5865
m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated	41.8662
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game	222.3938
de tréville crying to the rescue musketeers to the rescue as usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their comrades	90.5407
besides what is required of a young man in paris	29.6869
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder	61.8289
sir said davrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	376.5843
the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking composed	104.3913
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone	150.4845
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	86.7939
does he often go to auteuil added he	135.2543
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different affair yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that inot in the least i beg you to believe	92.5109
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth do you propose to me to do so dartagnan decidedly and honestly on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon	87.1878
how does he come by his namehis fortune	13674.0137
leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment do you know the mediterranean i have sailed over it since my childhood you know the best harbors there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage to dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us if he says true said the captain doubtingly	150.8837
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	27.3387
extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart	236.5189
and if i went to seek vampa would you accompany me if my society would not be disagreeable be it so	127.7892
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earthmy father and mercédès come said the abbé closing his hidingplace and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtierhis arrival at marseilles and interview with his fatherhis affection for mercédès and their nuptual feasthis arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château dif from this point everything was a blank to dantèshe knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned	143.0452
you were too young to know about such things i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about it and who told you about it asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience	40.9074
lean upon me and let us return to the camp yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged you have my word said he for the second time i give you your life the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but dartagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude	66.4387
look said dartagnan day is declining	4295461.0000
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	118.4104
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the redandyellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller	258.1372
such are for royalty and we are simple commoners speak not of crowns	1145.4708
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer	69.5404
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy	1068.5381
as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels and in case of surviving he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct what a madcap i was and what a stupid fellow i am that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram	188.0480
one may forsake a mistress but a wifegood heavens there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often wish for what is impossible what is that to find such a wife as my father found monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols	129.8736
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone	54.6419
is anyone ill in the house the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets	105.4296
what say you to that monsieur du vallon he added in a low tone to porthos	23.5338
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes	28.4100
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary yes so it is between perfectly upright people one word more said monte cristo	164.6678
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool	91.1556
come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit capital this evening with you tomorrow at stuarts the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said dartagnan	142.4435
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length	51.6611
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dressa jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat	490.4367
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my fathers stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no champsélysées	77.4463
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life oh heavens said the young man oh heavenswhat are you saying count	84.7179
_on y va_ coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms	330.1718
take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude ah here is m	84.2607
de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in or and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers	105.7555
there only remained three things to decidewhat they should write to miladys brother what they should write to the clever person at tours and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters	151.9311
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy	149.9641
monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand arrived near a clump of trees he stopped	114.9722
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect	272.5735
but vampa raised his head proudly as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold	163.0753
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars	102.1220
well have you tied the knot inquired the gravedigger who was looking on	167.2274
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues	207.7958
will you take me away with you	62.7260
your excellency is safe and sound asked the host	54.5581
is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words	65.8598
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is god m above us all sir was monte cristos response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered	244.2919
god has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept	59.9263
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen	63.3097
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesnt sympathize with the desires of others	167.4323
you know no one but monsieur de tréville he asked	35.2852
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm	182.1324
the count de rochefort grimaud nodded the third time	60.4236
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horsesone for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern	139.9081
if you want anything you can ring oh my god my god how i have suffered said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy	120.1979
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened	78.7845
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem	113.7008
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir	151.6751
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects	77.8728
de villefort said renée becoming quite pale dont you see how you are frightening usand yet you laugh what would you have	153.6018
why three days ago the emperor had not landed no matter i was aware of his intention how did you know about it by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba to me to you and which i discovered in the pocketbook of the messenger	54.3049
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasants costume	180.5041
they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions	510.3985
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said dartagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are yeshere we are said porthos	71.9551
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face	280.2747
it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place	50.0847
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise	32.7297
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow by confessing all he might prove his good will	105.4148
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it now they begin to look concerned nonsense however raoul must be diverted from this fancy	170.6052
yes and now i shall be more calm you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling	38.2023
i live because it is not ordained for me to die	58.0592
ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder	92.4962

the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air	88.6680
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	73.2285
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by dartagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to dartagnan that he should marry her	179.4232
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his doublet	150.0480
the th of february in what year in what yearyou ask me in what year yes replied the young man i ask you in what year you have forgotten then i got such a fright last night replied dantès smiling that i have almost lost my memory	91.6199
only a few days replied monte cristo	6.2658
no well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful	152.9635
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion	55.4601
i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy you are a brave youth dartagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature	234.3439
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home poor valentine i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless	137.7936
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own	51.7851
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court	124.8036
he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed	314.2642
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education	467.5136
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard dartagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal	96.0815
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte	63.3805
the motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy	106.7333
and is it your cook who prepares these pills asked beauchamp	3058.2542
as to athos he remained unmoved	377386.5938
he heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light	100.7608
who are you said the pilot in bad french	1772.8138
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crownswhich however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his _protégé_ monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville	83.3053
laws alone swamp our small staff	48100.5898
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dogs trick or other and that immediately said tréville	138.0964
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	86.9110
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any	108.8123
as happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am well speak if it depends on me oh sir it depends on you only i listeni am waiting to hear sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston since i have had the honor of being my lords steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me	116.1806
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twentyfive steps	52.6284
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted	157.1482
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly	345.7914
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos	326.0736
he turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner	88.5421
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away	49.9431
do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant	64.7178
some of that at the bottom near the laths	20629.0176
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity	82.2769
and of what malady it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face the smallpox thats a great story to tell me porthos sick of the smallpox at his age no no but wounded without doubt killed perhaps	108.6492
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea	129.4307
is it about sending me to the bastile	35.5111
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments	137.8662
thanks monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you	62.8963
as for porthos on whom dartagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute	109.2334
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked dartagnan	241.1366
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel chapter	695.7451
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and dartagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling	75.7692
thats well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to porthos and aramis but you dartagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally	38.7805
i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow	101.0330
nothing good replied dartagnan shaking his head	1.2471
he is saved he is saved cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight	159.6087
come come with me gentlemen exclaimed mazarin	60.8324
you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you	29.1912
what scotch ours egad exclaimed athos	3.1828
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young mans head fell on his breast	92.3856
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	122.2883
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated châteaurenaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other	131.4156
when they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork	196.6728
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this then turning to dartagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received	78.7832
andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari	85.2228
ay said he i see but you shall not kill me today	53.4636
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her	110.3366
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke	169.3816
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts	90.9950
it is late and the governor is asleep	239.9735
yes said milady lord de winter and now you can understand it all can you not	37.4447
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i dont know how long to the amount of or francs during the year	121.3544
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fécamp must she not m certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles and the yacht was ordered to remain at martigues tis well	230.4565
really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the handbarrow	199.8206
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental dartagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance	277.8213
he looked around him and saw mme	166.1565
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere	758.9335
ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finishone moment	271.2699
from that day dartagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven	97.9021
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing	63.7784
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game	292.7670
the daughter of ali pasha of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki and your slave _ma foi_ yes but how did she become so why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople wonderful really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream	98.8129
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper yes sir for all ive had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it	124.4390
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughters grave	97.6207
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation ah said dartagnan a singular commission who is this monsieur oliver cromwell inquired porthos	99.0363
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip	819.3950
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared	75.6644
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	441.2744
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one its true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist	159.8445
coquenard she could not restrain her tears but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband	158.6768
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds	249.6567
valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you valentine started	61.4504
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel	148.9570
be easy monsieur said planchet you do not know me yet	24.2510
come come said comminges who since dartagnan on the day of broussels arrest had saved him from the hands of the parisians had entertained a real affection for him dont be unhappy i never thought of bringing you bad news	92.0587
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our placecry down with mazarin i will down with mazarin in french in good french my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly	186.5949
it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento	273.0048
gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted	153.8875
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there yes your majesty he answered trembling	43.4028
no nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them	165.0312
everything is paid replied the host and liberally	965.7830
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence	270.2660
on beholding this house dartagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heartso powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	163.2838
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristos attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it	78.6233
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty	192.2996
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked	71.0073
ah there you are my good darminges i have given you a great fright have i not	135.4230
m general dépinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	69.7782
yes my lord well let us set out how many men does your eminence wish to escort you you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight as many as my lord wishes i will follow you	78.3552
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him	60.8367
then how do you hope valentine will escape noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot	110.0732
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior	72.8271
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder	50.3086
then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation	62.5361
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road	76.5865
but unfortunately i must wait m you must wait for what asked caderousse	64.2335
you know how little i require said the old man	35.2447
from that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard	236.6683
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials	205.5155
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed	66.9177
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same	106.8200
in the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg and future generations	47.0896
planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same	64.3294
i have told you that i was traveling on an important mission	164.9783
i live there during my leave of absence continued maximilian and i shall be together with my brotherinlaw emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply	87.4493
emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house	69.1073
dépinay said he allow me to remind you at this momentwhich is perhaps not so illchosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomballow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saintméran on her deathbed that valentines wedding might not be deferred	120.6518
danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry	150.5160
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure	97.3370
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it	79.4328
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo reentered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan	152.2847
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander very likely said albert	198.4243
adieu or rather _au revoir_ the mendicant continued to rip his garments and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles which he laid down on the table then he opened the door bowed and went out before the young man stupefied by his letter had ventured to address a word to him	71.1711
she returned to louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall	53.9206
the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no in the rue meslay	63.0539
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine	210.4798
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me so much the betterso much the better said caderousse	127.9526
do you understand the meaning of my words	14.0114
de villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible	95.4768
monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel	85.4636
when they had advanced about twenty yards danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon	162.5876
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish	304.8806
yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own well and what may you have to say against this name inquired albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess franz said no more	78.7117
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand	80.7404
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you dartagnan became more and more astonished	113.6016
i have now to confess to you	3.4867
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms	83.0490
the baroness approached leaning on madame de villeforts arm	38.4553
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice	99.0375
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass	50.4409
who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m	104.2218
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	164.3133
he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account	300.8693
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession	103.9913
the captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark	270.7425
born in the neighborhood of arles she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue	305.3578
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand	161.8018
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door	75.2192
de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence	46.6157
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak i speak of the adventureeh you know well what i mean alas no my lord replied dartagnan surprised	75.3819
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man	2.7301
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear dukeyou may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving	75.6029
you know me well enough we no longer know anyone madame you must be mad my friend said the baroness	62.6994
you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box	66.2443
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something	72.4175
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me	145.4265
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	2364.7405
theres no second constance in the world on his return to the cathedral dartagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan	93.1158
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural _ma foi_ said châteaurenaud i would rather end my career like m	232.2580
to cours la reine cried dartagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance	128.3593
at that moment the door opened	26.2562
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders	114.9871
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day	56.8649
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything	86.9854
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg	94.4016
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you	25.3512
there are men somewhere about but thats of no consequence to us said dartagnan let us ride onward at about halfpast eight oclock they reached the first houses in noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village	88.5778
do you think of dying my lord said she	30.0027
this evening the margin of possible delay expires what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them tonight pardieu we must go and look for them all right said athos	75.7260
one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès chamber	120.4536
this execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation	266.2372
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	74.7942
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears	71.8084
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised	167.6200
be kind enough then to send me francs tomorrow	387.5730
franz cried albert you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert well then hearken to me i listen you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question i do neither can we procure horses true we have offered any sum but have failed well now what do you say to a cart	102.3657
bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken	85.2887
eleven oclock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st germain	36.0695
the hôtel then is far away at the other end of the town very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage	63.9654
excuse me said dartagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him	59.8676
dartagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods	75.1041
but oh how i passed that time oh the wretched hours i have enduredthe torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it yes valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror	134.6433
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistressyour mistress above all dartagnan blushed	827.6049
love is the most selfish of all the passions	91.5610

i saw madame de saintméran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said châteaurenaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	137.4781
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said	63.9252
but i know you to be a man of honor the count again struck the gong	137.6030
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me	199.1180
i am weeping with joy he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pontdugard	138.5886
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raouls horse waving his particolored cap and crying broussel broussel halloo stop rascal cried dartagnan	298.4602

ifaith no said dartagnan i was not in voice monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either	96.5861
what are your grandmothers symptoms an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched	194.3032

i forgot there were three more steps before the landing you have hurt yourself perhaps said morrel	139.3194
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power	266.9622
one evening after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever	142.5692
i reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust	429.6783
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people	94.0178
he is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars	199.4268
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	119.8481
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand	113.9698

but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	112.8255

then he bowed a second time and retired	27.5055

ah ah is that you dear friend exclaimed porthos	54.4185
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend	118.0686

these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercédès coloring	100.7666
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivains respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention	179.8179

what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king	156.0771

ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear dartagnan what a fearful day when today we find our friends yes but under what circumstances tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done things look black enough replied porthos i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt silence cried the gascon do not utter that name but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english dartagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity	178.7224

but be assured my dear monsieur dartagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself oh i dont doubt that replied dartagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of armsa certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities	85.7143

say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of illhumor irritated him	169.0684
my mind was already made up	58.5598

dartagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility	400.8652
he repaired then instantly to the office of the _lieutenantcriminel_	90.7114
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	199.5606
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into truly athos interrupted dartagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of	135.9306
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	69.1849
the handle of this saucepan was of iron dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it	54.1628
but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the _pharaon_ where m	73.4333
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	140.2122
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris	101.1158
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair	20.5322
laporte could not leave the louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide	64.6585
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long	88.3402
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable	168.6725
the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity	208.6524
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror	187.6954
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together	300.6317
bazin hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand	87.7038
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed why we must inquire into that was caderousses reply and turning towards the young man said well catalan cant you make up your mind fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body	113.3759
arrest them ah my young man said dartagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed	77.3334
la rochelle which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other calvinist cities was then the focus of dissensions and ambition	208.0986
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château dif he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed	88.6021
a woman with athos after all continued dartagnan there was certainly one with aramis	141.3177
she loves him devilishly he murmured	413.5811
i do not recollect it said haydée	145.0914
the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer	295.4687
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility to youno to you alone listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god what do you say	149.0163
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i havent seen what does not concern me but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers and he added turning to porthos heres a gentleman whos of the same opinion as myself porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture	84.7082
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker	294.4980
the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding	137.4785
it is not your father or madame de villefort who is ill	42.5628
bonacieux i say that i have reflected i renew the affair i obtain the letter and i run directly to the cardinal well go quickly i will return soon to learn the result of your trip the stranger went out	88.5233
explain yourself my lord i am listening the queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to saint germain aha said dartagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave paris a womans capriceyou understand yes i understand perfectly said dartagnan	70.4888
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse	63.1191
the duke walked so fast that dartagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him	57.0516
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there	99.1612
oh no sir said madame danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality m ah yes said monte cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination	65.7133
do not be angry we can try it caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut	92.9318
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon	124.1581
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court	85.6872
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait dartagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended	223.1808
but athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty	162.2070
there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit pèrelachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous	209.9792
the countess took albert to meet madame danglars	59.9028
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat	106.9776
then you were about to tell me allthe isolation of your life the griefs of your heart	181.4925
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos	230.6293
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight	118.7162
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder	26.9157
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champsélysées	104.8788
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect	75.5166
but we are no longer in the city sir said she	41.2046
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea	161.3589
both entered and found themselves in darkness but mme	76.9685
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this houseyes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice	247.6428
there we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter but eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow	189.4890
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemys army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle	78.4796
yes the servant has given his description	1096.6975
you are late general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me ah i scarcely thought you were so curious as that i am always curious to see the downfall of your honors enemies and he was not among the least of them	81.0121
we have already observed with what rapidity dartagnan seized the expression of a countenance	98.6670
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile	24.5160
devil take the vain fellow said dartagnan	8.0292
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brigs departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	163.9702
ah i understand athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau	202.6442
this is all very strange said m	58.8060
without having been in the school of the abbé faria the worthy master of _la jeune amélie_ the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support	161.3883
he again ran back to the château	49.6999
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now	95.5051
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips	61.7124
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love	111.0009
well you stand well with m	134.1427
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis	133.0224
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to dartagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion	56.2697
what is this asked the captain	78.7688
de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years	64.9456
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterdays debauch	139.6790
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms	1044.8939
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september	102.1225
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever	117.8469
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris	59.6950
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	130.9813
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence	5154.5352
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck	74.8899
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen	330.1946
what says augustine on this subject _severus sit clericorum verbo_ yes let the sermon be clear said the curate	980.1188
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me	73.5268
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond	73.8762
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend	58.7598
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake what happened during the night asked beauchamp of châteaurenaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron	139.5303
but i say no more madame it is really as if i were prescribing for you the clock struck halfpast six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her	61.2403
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	93.0958
they are the count of châteaurenaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table m	219.5629
oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man	113.9257
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband	88.7725
gad replied dartagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st antoine	88.2767
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	102.4943
dartagnan alone was calm at least in appearance	135.6739
i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also	46.1037
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian it was precisely similar to his sisters apartments except that for the breakfastparlor he had a billiardroom where he received his friends	201.9557
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing i said dartagnan nothing and he read you have not answered my first note	66.6881
monsieur dartagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man possibly thought dartagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarins compliment	89.4122
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	109.7117
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another	90.3811
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes	109.0428
you know anne of austria the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go i am a dead man i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear dartagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer	104.6145
what the devil continued the king	17.8028
but first interposed dartagnan you must present me to madame du vallon a third sigh from porthos	64.6727
is he still as stingy as ever	22.6856
i thank you dartagnan you are more impetuous than you were returned dartagnan	86.0245
help me gentlemen cried dartagnan we must break in this door it is the devil in person said aramis hastening forward	85.2454
well said he do you still doubt oh murmured the young girl	58.6226
are you satisfied my lord he asked	72.7220
bravo athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him	200.7154
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed	453.1879
besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief i ought to be in that i shut myself uptell me no trulyyou comfort me come and help me from the same drawer she took a mans complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite	142.0642
but be of good cheer with certain people everything comes round oh you render me the happiest of men do not forget this eveningdo not forget that promise be satisfied	142.1876
we have so many worlds in the year of grace in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue come come that is not bad said lucien	91.9355
he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister	104.2120
oh good lord said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you	13.3672
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency giovanni obeyed	177.3367
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight	167.7937
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared	78.9033
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for anything	53.9483
hello here is my watch let me see what time it is danglars watch one of breguets repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five	119.3784
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings	191.6702
pretend to sleep louis said she	27.1095
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business	154.8098
like a philosopher danglars returned at this moment alone	33.4075
how can i go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall die by my hand pardon monsieur pity in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his handfor he began to lose his strength with his blood	85.7931
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said caderousse laughing	65.6790
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarins arrest wouldnt be rather an encumbrance than an advantage say at once you disapprove of my proposal i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	151.0760
relate your story madame said he wishing no doubt to profit by the absence of the husband so that the latter could not influence the wifes story to see if the two recitals tallied	124.7338
let goand clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards	258.0967
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m	59.3011
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	109.2431
if we are attacked we will defend ourselves if we are tried we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the sea	136.4699
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	81.6661
dartagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m	97.3270
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun	130.9104
mr spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him	61.0900
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf	210.0447
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the parkhunting perhaps no nearer nearer still	248.6840
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door	30.8941
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed	61.9884
presently the door opened and she perceived felton	162.2773
athos was introduced and announced by name	64.2014
yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that dartagnan did not perceive it	80.4819
to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance and this is to be achieved madame de villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively	97.0002
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers	122.2441
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one partyi am for fresh air	405.2009
i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	215.9444
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself	86.3395
at bottom the character of m	95.8828
faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt	32.3980
why then doesnt he attend to it himself as at chantilly ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges	100.0043
in truth said porthos i understand but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol	119.0880
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly	220.1300
dartagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly	153.1617
nay that he can almost work a miracle	272.0105
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head	66.7118
in fact mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met dartagnan and aramis and that dartagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the béarnese pony upon which he had come to paris and which he had sold for three crowns	56.9744
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us drink what asked the host quite cheerful again	164.9588
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes	169.9772
be clear short and precise as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputationof which i formed onewent yesterday to saint germain to impose on you	133.1789
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheardof that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs	129.9684
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else they continued their route	97.2010
no i would rather die by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated illfortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly follyto carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at	156.3174
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless when monte cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded doorpost	89.3751
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m	29.1957
and the drawers yes those at the side no the middle one yes valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers	75.2427
a passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london	37.5433
no false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos	89.9133
noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence	11000.8936
in these caves the treasure is in the furthest a	79.2448
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke	56.6159
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men	167.2211
coquenard had eaten his soup the black feet of the fowl and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat	138.6847
well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the island of elba disembark at portoferrajo ask for the grandmarshal give him this letterperhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission	208.3509
they are robbers perhaps he muttered	1150.0928
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo	73.9366
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m	85.0841
the duke however was not dead	1703.9386
one of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore	487.0154
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	100.5068
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans	229.7151
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five oclock in the morning until nine oclock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebièrea street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailorbut there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès	105.4840
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly onethird of the paper had been consumed by the flame	167.4388
a burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder felton uttered a groan	98.6123
well will you take me or shall i take edward madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m	113.8273
he answered in the same language	358.3480
the commission is usually one and a half will you have twothreefive per cent or even more	241.0443
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake	99.9149
and what makes me all the more wretched sir is that i was the cause of this misfortune how so asked athos	91.5635
you appear to forget yourself sadly no sir said albert coldly there are circumstances in which one cannot except through cowardicei offer you that refugerefuse to admit certain persons at least what is your errand then with me sir i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplacei mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficientwhere two men having met one of them will remain on the ground danglars turned pale cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him	162.5384
and who brought you up he asked again	141.5382
his mother the councillors old servant opened it	43.0564

at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a childs caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mothers voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given	131.2948
de trévilles note in the other	16.1738
dartagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume	148.3421
at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	169.4068
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m	94.1260
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned unquestionably so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time precisely m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman	97.5955
have you proof of this i had it and you have lost it how stupid yes but by careful search it might be recovered really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me and the count humming an air from _lucia_ went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts	143.6815
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age	159.9176
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas	141.9549
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur dherblay and myself to do in your service	66.7670

ah plague ont i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal this arrangement pleased every one	222.3434
yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth but we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable for my own part i demand it said aramis	113.6090
an approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him	129.5296
he started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her	266.3252
he is i think the son of general dépinay he is the same who was so shamefully assassinated in by the bonapartists yes	218.6159

now for the wager we listen monsieur athos yes the wager said the lighthorseman	324.1218
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood	229.3764
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited	71.0286
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier	86.9182
all villeforts influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dantès had so nearly divulged	192.4258
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countesss visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme m and you will probably find your theme illchosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present	148.1760
shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensuedthe silence of death which was allpervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès	180.6055
m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable	241.2818
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service	248.2134
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens	617.5145
dépinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss	13524.6084
the invalids eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable	165.4967
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar	389.9056
pray tell me how i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oilhere is my lamp so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations	382.9031
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy	582.6191
has morrel whom we know been killed	1029.1909
has the law any eyes to witness your grief	130.2292
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through	132.7022
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	140.6818
well monsieur i am at your service if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention	56.2336
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m	49.1828
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andreas attentions in order to get rid of morcerf but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him	236.5394
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	221.8704
what are you thinking of dartagnan he began	95.8549
what were you doing replied she	53.8612
since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles that is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste	262.1032
why this woman was a monster he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished	213.1279
i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a twofranc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon thank you my good friend	82.6688
stop he said there he is at his post gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand	60.8758
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity	886.1077
i take them said dartagnan for myself	58.4629
that last order is useless interrupted dartagnan there are loaded pistols in your holsters bazin sighed	314.4990
the count of monte cristo cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage i should think we would see him	65.7022
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now no father stammered villefort at least i hope not and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care oh rely on me said villefort	93.3357
pah where are you going cried the two musketeers in a breath	64.6651
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knewthat they had been seized stripped and bound	220.3376
and madame de villefort to my countryhouse at auteuil	2525.0793
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight	76.5571
she had heard something said about supper	2206.2593
at first the king answered that he would not go but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner and the king has seen the cardinal asked m	64.6286
i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees	93.7406
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	133.5429
at first they saw nothing around them	125.5012
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated	153.6404
de trévilles but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m	57.7266
oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches thou who like beings of a superior order to ourselves couldst understand the science of good and evil if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and sufferedthen noble heart sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the count bowed his head and clasped his hands together	198.4532
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was omitted go on go on said dartagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come	290.8216
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master but how shall we get back upon our lackeys horses _pardieu_	128.2999
the lackey bowed and let them pass	70.8380
de busigny so let us fix the stake you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight	110.7653
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service that may be true replied porthos but i am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much oh blind selflove thought dartagnan	86.5672
dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea	174.0018
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person	128.5268
let us go immediately they sent for a cabriolet	104.0088
now i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics and that in all humility that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little	116.7397
gentlemen good morning as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m	75.1059
it was the signal of a visit	106.8024
my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m	160.0846
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears	324.8221
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them	50.4449
what next de wardes cannot boast of anything how is that	59.4819
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs	1545.2321
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deepseated hatred of idealitythese were the elements of private and public life displayed by m	483.5694
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to falluntil at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer	354.4128
thank you dartagnan said comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your namethat i may mention it to the queen raoul was about to reply when dartagnan bent down to his ear	85.5768
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses what is it be so good as to give me up your sword count athos smiled and opened the window	43.6819
but the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his selflove which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart	181.9320
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing	60.6532
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice	64.9480
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken	105.3581
doubtless although less evident monte cristos joy was not less intense	122.6687
are you still resolved to accompany me more determined than ever well then come along franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino	97.9087
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded mouston breathed a sigh he couldnt understand visits of ceremony made under arms	354.4706

so important a negotiation should i think be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence	76.3098
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead	63.7934
i shall fight heart and soul for mazarin but but but he must make me a baron zounds said dartagnan thats settled already i will be responsible for the barony on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friends assurance turned back with him toward the castle	112.5374
it was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation	161.7198
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice	96.1906
danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m	91.8321
a folded paper fell from edwards breast	5807.6602
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong and both again left the room	54.7686
dartagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	138.9107
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it	105.8212
tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth	72.0260

but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her dartagnan which is not the part of a gentleman we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop bah said dartagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it	94.3715
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened oh juxon said the king seizing the bishops two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage	163.8167
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door	59.2892
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered dartagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen	59.4543

the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations	164.3977
now as a halfsmile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined	153.0736

so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purseproud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo	136.5585

well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal	29.2427
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs you guess well i know something of diamonds i have had some you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring	114.0083
how if there is any left murmured he	97.3506
we are compelled to admit to our readers that dartagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be	69.2991
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper	88.6689
save me save me porthos and aramis arose	24.7832
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions	86.2329
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects	614.0283
isnt this fox a genius athos asked the gascon	23.4743
the clock of the invalides struck one	68.6548
you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting do not fear i have little to prepare monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation	98.9451
i will then release you from all your promiseseven that of procuring my admission into the musketeers for before everything i wish to avenge myself beware young man cried tréville	152.2529
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing ah said a gallant old general who in had sung _partant pour la syrie_we will not go alone to the garden then said mercédès i will lead the way turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercédès	120.5794
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed mme	288.5921
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work	119.1574
because replied dartagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest and you have been here since about a quarter of an hour said dartagnan motioning to porthos not to contradict him	57.3204
now to apply it in your caseto whom could your disappearance have been serviceable to no one by heaven i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place	150.3219
what is the matter my dear m	18.7831
what you do not know have you neglected to obtain information on that point	110.1894
those who have read the _memoirs_ of mme	1243.9358
yes yes very sure perhaps you did not see well oh if i were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak i should know _him_ milady was dressing herself all the time	99.0197
yes sdeath in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend	57.3177
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	199.2426
oh dearest marie she thinks of me then after five years of separation heavens there is constancy then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me grimaud signified his assent	177.7543
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or antipoetic impressions and sensations	470.4211
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first	65.3181
will you not come with me he said i shall pass by blois raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go	48.1618
oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of god at least in your own name if not as priest then as son pardon you cried the pretended monk pardon you perhaps god will pardon you but i never for pitys sake said the executioner extending his arms	86.1863
what the devil there must be plenty left replied dartagnan	145.3892
he remembered how at the louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful madame de longueville	111.0225
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the morning	50.3986
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir	60.2873
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me	69.7933
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars	45.0298
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	220.2810
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter dartagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes	77.5907
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order	30.0649
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio	268.3045
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the english regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance	86.8152
im not the man you take me for you are in captain rogerss post are you not	113.8825
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis	198.2873
do you wish me to lend you some m what a bad calculator you are exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation	255.1480
how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixtysix years old	222.1860
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud yes as an augustine monk what sized man is he about my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair and he did not see raoul asked athos	287.0572
but you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus	199.5821
dandré looked at louis xviii who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head	58.1137
in the kings name cried comminges	477.0863
we must inform the queen ah my faith yes said porthos and dartagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now inform the queen said athos and how	35.2507
de boville the inspector of prisons no rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrels hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned	150.1080
these keys were given up to him instantly	33.3778
yes said châteaurenaud these italians are well named and badly dressed you are fastidious châteaurenaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and quite new that is just what i find fault with	158.5552
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my paywhich i am never paid by the wayto make the king five years older really and pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv	125.7584
stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his voice ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at noisy	276.9406
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes	327.4847
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one	304.9861
dartagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends	96.6747
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg	208.2058
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel	144.9176
many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself	206.4086
bonacieux eagerly and looking at dartagnan with disquiet	1001.7531
she was a charming woman of twentyfive or twentysix years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal	257.5045
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily the friends embraced	395.7739
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which dartagnan took and shook in his	53.5408
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery	141.7061
m no she replied it is for my poor grandmother	95.3369
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence	103.4343
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	71.2684
your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer i have my answer ready the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu	105.8252
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii	141.0364
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then i felt that i was lost felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body	169.1141
dantès went and cut the strongest olivetree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever	257.6534
sit down my dear friend and let us talk and aramis pushed forward a large easychair in which dartagnan stretched himself out	73.2366
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat	380.9922
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of buckingham gave dartagnan a chamber adjoining his own	81.7805
in the first place do you accept asked the cardinal	47.4163
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write they then separated	148.2872
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter	27.9934
why this evening said the abbess today even	1808.1217
excuse me excuse you for what	48.6019
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master or his mistress interrupted dartagnan	83.5351
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than dartagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a mans head inside the carriage	120.6175
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	116.1701
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the abovementioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his fathers abode	127.2869
you will make tea for us baptistin said the count	19.9104
ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died of what did he die why the doctors called his complaint gastroenteritis i believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused	127.1397
m the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably	178.9691
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner	178.1682
how does this misfortune affect you	1.6012
poor athos said he he will never guess what all this means	138.6165
so much the betterso much the better nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it mercédès said the old man	84.8104
andrea to think of marrying i think not sir replied m	42.1835
that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping hima stranger to your countrywith arms with money or with troops	555.4113
de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist	153.3138
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it m go then into the drawingroom my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room	59.8719
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation	241.4960
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow so tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back again	146.7810
they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopos directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	147.3178
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind	156.6382
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen	342.4999
bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and curiosity	3117.6748
i wish to thank them all at once	55.3290
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme	299.9522
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers	172.3381
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person	50.5123
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rightsthat would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood with the queen sir replied athos in his calm vibrating voice	231.6105
de villefortwhat do you mean i mean that m	23.4550
as soon as possible i am at your command sir shall we return together if not unpleasant to you on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure thus the future father and soninlaw stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy	127.6731
here cried porthos here porthos foresaw that if dartagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed	78.0644
dartagnan saw that the moment was come	85.9448
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him	43.8499
what is the matter said the count	6.0311
the same evening all villeforts servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave	46.6994
yes my lord ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling	59.0996
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day	100.3771
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends	132.6833
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived	224.6690
oh said she seizing the counts hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you edmond now you are exactly what i dreamt you werethe man i always loved	136.4766
dartagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him	43.3636
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say you are wrong you must advise me what to do do you seriously ask my advice valentine certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain	96.9219
ah hurrah theres the sun a merry morning to you sunshine	396.8863
very well indeed sir replied comminges at first like you he seemed distressed but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening ah cried dartagnan the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere yes and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself ah our dear count said dartagnan	42.7136
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	47.0462
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been	73.0914
_my mass_ lord de winter the corrupted catholic knows very well that i am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me and of what religion are you then madame asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal	87.3509
bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that dartagnan was quite overcome	156.0758
the mind can see as well as the body	29.7750
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heartthree of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning	101.0569
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies	121.5015
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew	60.0005
as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection	137.4334
m the same deadly silence succeeded these words	134.7450
i have two horsesi do not count my servants bobtailed nag	2001.2079
he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sublieutenant of the rd of the line	174.3951
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors	182.1262
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m	34.2312
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven	205.1389
bigamy my dear come now you dont really wish it but he is dead i am sure of it he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave peste my darling another way of getting hanged so you refuse my request to be sure i dofuriously the pretty landlady was desolate	159.8312
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably	210.5117
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	39.4939
they came nobody knew whence but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they came	170.3299

franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet	437.4639
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit	94.7627
in each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses	844.2045
this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in	71.3327
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same	51.6745
her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty	131.3788
the king threw himself into an armchair	45.0028

if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished	183.4638
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his breast it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely	82.9926
de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the kingand then for himself and his own friends	106.5287

but as we have said dartagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty	182.7337
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to alberts request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon	140.1161
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	95.3753
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness	47.3527

did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine no and yet you say he has sent you some as from us here is his letter said dartagnan and he presented the note to his comrades	90.8268
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed	299.5885
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before	67.4933
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber	31.8358

it is an everyday occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart	108.9861
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me m right dantès quite right	65.0562

of aramis yes since he has become an abbé	58.6060
very well cried dartagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said dartagnan	166.9541
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror	168.1692
descend my lord said the man in the moat	119.1937
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself	192.7315
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again	136.5020
and monsieur dartagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur dherblay may i ask if you have any news of him we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us no sir i am sure he hasnt yet arrived	82.7582

bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much	81.7244
a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design	1584.1150
i am twentyone years old or rather i shall be in a few days as i was born the night of the th of september m	33.9678
but the easychair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room	47.0030
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off come added the king	92.1807
the usurpers conversion murmured the duke looking at the king and dandré who spoke alternately like virgils shepherds	218.0541
but dartagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts	246.5558
each was accompanied by two priests	2459.1274
ah you are awake madame he said then i have nothing more to do here	29.2859
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the englisheminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for fishing	396.0219
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment	56.4229
in fact dartagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests	83.4983
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench	56.7214
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he	49.2858
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstoolnow let us talk about our own affairs	103.8897
you think of everything said dartagnan and i thank you for planchet my dear athos raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed	65.9014
just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road	1284.7917
oh you beautiful good little creature said milady	140.0788
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france	88.5650
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made	187.0318
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything	720.3335
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the kings room	79.1369
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so nobleminded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	139.2535
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself exactly therefore i think of sending him away from here you will be wise to do so no doubt of it but it will break his heart	105.5286
towards the house the chestnuttrees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air	244.6214
in the bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort i am of monsieur de bassompierres party	114.2221
they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place	49.0495
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room	109.1693
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul	115.0426

go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	249.0229
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind	1029.9877
she believed the order ready for execution	126.2024
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised	65.1652
i heard the chevalier dherblay say so the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures	198.5546
it is running now dartagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever	171.4813
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons	120.9701
my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches	53.8756
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far	95.1105
morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès from m	182.6432
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house	87.9477
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone	51.2373
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto	110.0255
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan thank you sirthank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her	110.7769
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos my plan yes have you a plan no i am hungry that is all pardieu if that is all i am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips	110.1563
de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens	220.7898
three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds	1125.7197
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure	53.9002
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it byi saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you foolwhat should you know about itwhy you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse	144.6226
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal	70.8619
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself dartagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenants commission in the musketeers	81.6915
this is the abbé of whom i spoke said the doctor to davrigny	74.9556
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name	124.4391
albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well	69.9942
it was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been gained but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him	186.7569
i understand answered porthos i understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it but what will people say let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it but who will distribute these things asked porthos	76.8750

m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon but you have seen him sire i went straight to the duc de blacas but you will see him then i think not sire ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive i forgot you and m	54.7512
the glance was of sublime eloquence	9559.1006
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes	101.7390
bertuccioyou are going to stay in the carriage then	30.7711
all took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the _style énergique_ commented on the feverish agitation of andrea on m	223.4933
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publishers office	236.6557
you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already	53.8270
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic	224.3601
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal lower _sacré bleu_ said athos	241.8661
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board	37.1289
what is to be done asked dartagnan	46.9478
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend	143.4054
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by dartagnan all for one one for all thats well now let us everyone retire to his own home said dartagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal chapter x	122.9619
when she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arms to him and believed herself safe but carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her	104.6077
i have only one thing to say to you	28.8606
the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it	117.2220
dartagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	146.1709
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	249.7820
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a lowborn fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them	125.1891

had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the ministers homage with civility	154.9261
for my part observed aramis i cannot say the same as you do porthos	56.6767
well then asked athos in a low tone	6.6854
the husband heard of the affair on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible animals which you are taking back to him said dartagnan	137.4848
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use me the abbé dherblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii of whom i have spoken to you madame then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service	81.7236
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being kings attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and thats rather against him well well returned m	99.2403
ah my poor friend resumed dartagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead ifaith said rochefort theres no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive now i have been buried alive or very nearly so and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile do you wish me to speak the truth yes well then i dont know have you any suspicion of me rochefort no on the honor of a gentleman but i cannot be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible what reason asked dartagnan	82.9362
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted	20.1690
thats the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine	61.1160
he will come in here and m	34.3312
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy	46.4111
i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you tréville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failedhe who knows how bitterly i execrate himto tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him	135.0546
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet continue said the queen	100.3409
mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him	106.4109
what six of his eminences guards arrest six of his majestys musketeers _morbleu_ my part is taken i will go straight to the louvre i will give in my resignation as captain of the kings musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinals guards and if he refuses me _morbleu_ i will turn abbé at these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies	128.8328
what prevents you from being so oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars marry her then said the count with a significant shrug of the shoulders	61.0430
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself ready	188.9633
they had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell	181.7620
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes	216.3239
the commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the table	36.9331
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth oh go on monsieur go on said madame de chevreuse eagerly you cant imagine how much this conversation interests me you encourage me said athos i will continue then	116.5996
all doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at rome	248.5737
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and dartagnan more than anyone	79.8070
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv no you are right my dear rochefort it couldnt be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon ah indeed i forgot to ask youwhere are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know	114.1672
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath	66.3242
the army i will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs the expression was imprudent but m	152.6664
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money m mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference	260.1547
what a hundred thousand francs for a fowl ah excellency you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves come come this is very drollvery amusingi allow but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat	171.4290

i am luigi vampa shepherd of the sanfelice farm what do you want i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before	113.3046
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host	67.1835
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners	105.1710
the movement was executed in silence and with precision	270.5586
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way	35.2024
courage cried raoul courage too late murmured the young man too late the water closed above his head and stifled his voice	48.5300
however proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the othersthat is in order to make war against us	66.9691
there was a great press of people in m	50.1120
what is this name of monte cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title i believe mother it is merely a title	91.0395
dartagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him	103.3779
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer yes much said dartagnan who did not well know how to answer	102.8464
dartagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends	216.7217
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian	70.4231

i feel if this continues said mme	156.3400
does your majesty require anything further	988.6938
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	173.1354
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m	80.2046
m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights	137.3989
if they continue to advance we must fire again	140.3361
nothing is lost then and now madame till i see you again tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out	77.9003
because she had been branded continued dartagnan	76.0711
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed	359.5670
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much	303.3769
it was at this moment dartagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutors carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladiesinwaiting drove out and the gates were shut after them	83.7773
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the eventi was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east	98.0118

pardon meat least such i have heard is your custom nay madame	126.2584
pray let me know who you really are the stranger smiled a melancholy smile	141.7919
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls	195.4630
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern	43.3360
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol	98.2426
davrigny about the death of m	84.0726
at blois dartagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal	96.2785
god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space	252.2461
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came	94.3312
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure oh my legs my poor legs where are you murmured coquenard and he tried to smile	94.8118
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myselffor i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglersbut for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend	216.6203
andrea only calls himself count calls himself do you say yes calls himself is he not a count what can i know of him	71.0742
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes	82.6396
alberts love had not taken away his appetite	139.6352
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations	5714.4102
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make	202.8157
remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service the young king looked at the officer with his largeformed eye and repeated monsieur dartagnan that is it my son the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed it	64.4480
was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senators robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him	88.1507
deuce take those italian princes a man too who could boast of dante for a genealogist and could reckon back to the _divina comedia_ a nobility of the rope said châteaurenaud phlegmatically	385.2128
at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectatorsromans italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius	272.2622
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism	539.2538
my first visit was to the thicket	288.5981
de tréville in practice instantly dartagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise	65.1139
are these persons then so rich and powerful do you not know their history i do not	57.5349
how did this happen said morrel	48.8498
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room	125.6611
no you sounded me nothing more	18.7235
why an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head	29.5735
you love me you cried he	29.3578
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m	139.1479
de morcerf yes but then he breakfasted with meindeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion but your house is not m	114.4914
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers	263.2340
m friend he cried i feel that i am dying thanks he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him	84.2845
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos	34.7412
then three or four shots were fired	68.6306
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation	170.9451
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period	73.7571
the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed	440.7295
at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice and said i want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon as to the man to be depended upon i have him under my hand monsieur said m	80.8147
i was then obliged to come back again	59.6377
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses	197.5193
look at me madamelook around me	3.1928
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the _danseuse_ who acquired such a reputation in london	110.1875
the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénies character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection	173.1550
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in ritas left breast	109.4275
noirtier asked morrel while davrigny looked inquiringly	1279.2550
now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence	41.5926
dartagnan appointed eight oclock at athoss residence	3122.9805
it was the same through which twentyfour years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed	145.6416
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment	213.4990
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	510.8492
to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help see sections and and the foundation information page at	26.1303
at this word athos and aramis jumped up	69.9898
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone	96.8716
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone	137.7612
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	52.6463
now said the baron look at this woman	59.3382
dartagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon	86.6823
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos	44.4266
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris ah reallyto paris and will it be the first time you have ever been there dantès yes have you business there not of my own the last commission of poor captain leclere you know to what i allude danglarsit is sacred	129.0460
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position	571.3173
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him	117.3608
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish to horse porthos said dartagnan taking his friend by the hand	72.9651
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday an hour after sunset if they go out today as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour in a quarter of an hour at most your arm is still strong enough is it not porthos porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man	130.0082
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé dherblay of whom you have often heard me speak i remember him monsieur come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	53.3821
but devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions	100.0396
it was necessary to reach m	151.4555
who is there answered the voice of her he sought	80.2308
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens	79.9969
however in an hour i shall know all	52.8467
come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught	127.7894
oh my god cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell	72.3461
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded	174.8785
twenty guards well mounted are all that i shall need for my escort that is very few said the marshal	77.0513
the _mêlée_ became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers	22.4421
now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you thought of inviting m	154.0881
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony	95.1442
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspectors voice called him to the visitingroom	888.5457
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to younot mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the playfellow of our king louis xiii whom god preserve sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger	181.1887
what line would you advise me to study the one that is most in use just at this time the spanish one you mean i suppose yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it	60.1386
dartagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table	124.1015
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget	127.9205
de tréville looking at the clock why thats impossible look rather monsieur said dartagnan the clock shows it thats true said m	179.3696
ah if mousqueton were here theres a fellow who will never desert me so long as you are rich ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us	154.7910
_quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem_ aramis cast a glance upon dartagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws	177.3827
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic your thesis are you then making a thesis without doubt replied the jesuit	209.8418
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold	66.6847
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed halfdesperate at the enforced delay three days ago	214.4611
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos said the procurators wife	109.9425
i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions	195.4353
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms	163.9070
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twentyfive men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison	109.3866
two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is you yes it is i and you come asked milady	54.6811
you are going sir yes said cromwell	129.7358
france is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant and who is to pursue him cried mazarin	101.0771
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence	117.7499
morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m	66.0845
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could	70.8104
do you fear any approaching evil	2558.5637
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores	472.1056
aramis and his thesis dartagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurators wife	48.1140
it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures	80.8406
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship	117.2284
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlepieces with flowers	1367.7729
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you	50.8364
the tree was easy to climb	39869.7188
apropos when do you aspect m	62.4956
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation	90.5915
cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle	133.6872
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign	220.5738
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected	51.6336
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	60.2519
de morcerf as the officer fernand mondegoindeed i do cried haydée	902.7944
the two brigands looked at each other for a momentthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow	80.7503
did you see the postscript i did indeed	129.5166
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors	147.2998
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the evening	7.3378
morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance	292.6203
oh i am dying he again fainted	1728.5481
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crownpiece in the dust	60.6619
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz	96.8143
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty the king smiling turned a few steps back	97.3449
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre	132.2680
and now to table said athos	15.5650
the people who wrote are anglogermans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor	118.4080
it is he who in an encounter with your eminences guards decided the victory in favor of the kings musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable dartagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal	73.7511
i dont see why we are very comfortable in those we wear to prevent recognition said dartagnan	342.6340
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	84.9575
you provide in accordance with paragraph a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work	25.7614
just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel why really the thing seems to me simple enough	134.6280
yes yes said milady the letter is precise	2875.4993
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo	483.5159
de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court	113.7433
oh mercy mercy monsieur what i require is that justice be done	87.5130
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon	29.3788
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father then sire may i present him this instant duke where is he waiting below in my carriage seek him at once i hasten to do so the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again	164.8533
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking	216.5000
dartagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate	359.0998
one might believe the queen was about to speak	33.9017
no was the old mans reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moments repose but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abbé	64.8466
at last dartagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing	197.2403

the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse well transfer it to me at the price it cost you i was going to make you the offer my dear dartagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle how much did it cost you eight hundred livres here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said dartagnan taking the sum from his pocket i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems you are rich then said aramis	75.7715
undoubtedly madame said dartagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office tomorrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own	80.5090
sire said dartagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question louis xiv	52.1116
do you think you have to do with galleyslaves or novices in the world	256.4221
anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy	37.9101
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one waythey killed time for him till eight oclock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep	139.7655
ah said dartagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold	573.4855
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave	89.9710
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets	183.8128
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french	165.8303
he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman	368.5252
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of dartagnan and porthos in their hands	81.8902
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity	88.8762
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done me no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england then you dont know me sir it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me none i swear to you there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured	72.0029
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will	384.3669
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own	80.5680
rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow i understand replied fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine	96.0647
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator well when we quitted naples captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever	130.8187
she saw a woman in a white dressinggown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass	402.8553
our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of francs	114.9753
neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more	114.3917
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress	60.8462
impossible what do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw killed yes she was married asked aramis	107.5560
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read	32.7279
a small door close to the lodge of the _concierge_ gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot	177.5951
dartagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence	60.0674
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment	50.3928
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate dartagnan who had time before him walked around and reentered by the porte richelieu	114.1062
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words october it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse	117.9419
dartagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat	32.1402
then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan andrea had left him	94.5975
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken	95.6812
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister	49.5101
follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps wait an instant said the host number has two staircasesinside and outside good said the brigadier	189.1921
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting	104.8313
well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we desire	120.8023
no madame if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied athos	119.7275
the elder prisoner pondered the matter	131.1767
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawingroom before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bowwindow and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble fathers departure	205.5048
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	89.3223
we engaged our word our word included everything	661.9517
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoners feverish imagination	111.3687
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered	138.9911
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	123.3659
he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses	220.4351
hence it resulted when dartagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard	93.4054
are you not he asked the priest who here in the château dif is generally thought to beill mad you mean dont you i did not like to say so answered dantès smiling	123.7390
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it	58.1124
suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead	132.5974
i dont need the quarter of such a sumi who am still only in the guardsand by selling my saddles i shall procure it	172.0427
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police	89.6098
go sir go but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it	56.1050
this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside	194.7667
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed	97.3843
you to be sure said dartagnan pressing athoss hand	45.1844
the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice	144.5693
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him	112.4124
if he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel	141.2989
everything dartagnan even folly has its limit then your means it appears are improved you have a capital houseyour own i presume	342.0264
in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearancean enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves	330.2477
in ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage	78.0410
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day	93.0953
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties	25927.0742
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing	109.5595
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure	94.5856
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no originonce a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	123.0370
i find england a charming country and i staybut on one condition only what is it that i am not forced to learn english well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears usi believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again so be it said dartagnan but ii confess i have a contrary conviction our good dartagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye but in the meantime saves the country added athos	184.7198
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him	248.5585
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned dartagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game	88.7406
athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the parpaillot	179.5751
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldnt share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain	174.4243
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis	66.8679
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose	114.3890
order my lord he said i am ready to obey your eminence monsieur dartagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor	124.2203
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner probably not well listen baptistin what did i tell you this morning when i called you into my laboratory to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet	68.1681
rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people	81.6013
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe	105.2228
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheekbones were broad and projecting a neverfailing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his buttonhole	200.9799
captivity the fifth day chapter lvii	591.8578
dead no dying saddled yes saddled and bridled then we are upon the fugitives courage we have them but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us nonsense cried dartagnan theyll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as were in pursuit theyll be afraid and will disperse certainly remarked porthos	212.6211
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber	68.4053
this letter was in miladys handwriting only this time it was addressed to m	45.3182
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force	204.2630
i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child	76.3422
peppino put out the torch peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall	108.7047
alas said milady i know it is so	17.1869
but reallyno matter go on the journey of that day had been long and wearing it was a cold day the eleventh of october there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive	153.5878
have you lost your heart indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valère reply to alceste at the théâtre français	218.4176
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me let us see the watch said albert	127.2387
here is what the letter contained milady be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be present	99.1486
welladay how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos this cannot be monsieur porthos observed planchet replying as it were to his masters thoughts	68.2727
ho there my friend the wounded man heaved a sigh	64.6057
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud grimaud replied athos	132.8063
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	107.0050
and wherefore fire said the colonel every one has yielded it is the son of milady said athos to dartagnan	76.5858
de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried dartagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from me he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m	202.9643
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices	126.4952
the surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted	14.5087
you are a simpleton said athos	8.5412
cavalcanti and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly what	116.3564
danglars alone was content and joyoushe had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the _pharaon_ secure	144.0323
you are the directors of all consciences	7917.0220
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming i follow you m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlinis part	190.7957
before questioning me he said reply to my question	107.7488
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m	136.1294
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him	131.7189
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos	128.0316
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch	747.9790
do you know that i am growing old	156.5404
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again	82.3057
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me	118.2695
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole	66.5962
buckingham threw himself at her feet and before the queen could prevent him kissed the hem of her robe	111.2594
noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strangethe father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics	164.8167
i mean the russian prince who you said had livres and we only found you must have searched badly luigi vampa himself searched in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that or spent the money possibly after all certainly	229.3074
ah ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh porthos murmured the comte de la fere	74.9364
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal	70.1341
i had fixed the embarkation for the twentyfourth but i have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be	62.1845
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence	130.4474
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course	182.6005
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard	154.4828
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it	141.5940
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto	192.9243
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that dartagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind	69.3122
he then looked at the objects near him	787.4376
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais dartagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation	107.0520
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh	104.1546
if you had been ten years engaged in war as grimaud and i have been my dear blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies	67.6368
the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world	86.1954
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop	77.0944
olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use	88.3975
he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death	104.5617
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another	187.1341
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	79.6194
put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with consider all this done	76.8182
i furnished myself with a light you did	329.6946
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted	84.6295
well my dear dantès are you now free inquired the owner	159.6852
marvelous that falls out oddly three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman	119.0501
it was a strange thing and one which made dartagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder	170.5654
twentyfour years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country	248.6758
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose	122.9318
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on	167.1994
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy	296.8018
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through	162.0679
they have closed up the grating with a board that is well god has made them senseless said felton	148.7537
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name	181.2801
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects	335.9360
do you know my dear villefort cried the comte de salvieux that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries when questioned by his majestys principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de condé and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles	92.6342
an englishman you say yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome	47.2729
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing theres no need to go over the ground a second time ah it was this gentleman said dartagnan bowing to the officer	46.2328
for my part i should not hesitate a moment i should take the hundred pistoles	50.1615
and why not asked the young man	4.1006
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	174.2933
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms just so where do you come from now i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse	72.9555
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people	181.7431
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out whos there and dartagnan answeredhaving first asked the word of the cardinallouis and rocroy after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost	176.2957
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with	86.5885
are we going to continue this pace all night asked planchet	134.4768

i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orangetree one after another	299.3266
you cursed host a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with basdry there said the dragoon	131.9712
retire valentine said she you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you drink a glass of pure water it will restore you valentine kissed eugénie bowed to madame danglars who had already risen to take her leave and went out	74.3929
to the boat to the boat but porthos i do not see him porthos is cominghe swims like leviathan in fact porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward	131.3330
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridorhis ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder	156.3257
unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut upcaptured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered	137.2701
dartagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before	76.8374
now the mischief is out depend upon it the customhouse people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden treasures mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lovers arrest	247.2605
at three oclock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin	88.5638
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just	161.2997
instinctively fernand drew back his chair	123.8253
he was called count he was said to possess livres per annum and his fathers immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme	339.2305
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought	87.4298
de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor	113.4762
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp	161.3117
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments _quærens quem devoret_	531.0307
passing alongside one of them dartagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meungthe same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom dartagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her	133.6807
will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me thanks count no replied de winter	81.6048
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor	387.3967
dartagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for	156.5329
he could already see the intendants beaming smile change to a contortion of grief	1704.8611
at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park	91.3962
well what is itwhat is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out	49.6030
ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him alas sighed bazin	302.3747
de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine wellgrown girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat	262.0573
a man of the counts temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones	337.6631
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirtyfive francs albert then took a pen and wrote frs	402.3748
at this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other	105.7768
a physician was sought for but none was yet found	522.8898
no louise no this evenings adventure will serve for my excuse	113.8818
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum	203.0375
dartagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre	147.1827
apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alone well be it so then	105.4776
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the birds waterglass	211.0294
m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt	105.2852
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen	907.9356
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself	62.0548
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian	58.9621
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together	218.7962
the valet de chambre appeared on the doorsteps	201.0182

yes sir come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit do you not guess monsieur asked morrel	49.6469
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled	53.7795
at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two frenchmen	80.3335
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony m ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget peoples faces but also the conditions you make with them what conditions have i forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it	86.3272
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing	69.5274
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you you will bring him then	51.5035
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno indeed you have then a repugnance to your profession so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as i was by justice and law but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of gods creaturessince that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair	109.9156
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but dartagnan confined himself to telling them that m	64.0481
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid	216.1416
in that case felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary	339.4604
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five oclock was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one muttered dartagnan	86.2290
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me how did the viscount albert fall into luigis hands excellency the frenchmans carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa the chiefs mistress yes	244.1511
edmond had one friend only and thus it cannot be divided	160.1629
perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled and five minutes after i left without having heard one word that had passed poor maximilian murmured valentine	134.5212
davrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative	402.8175
i have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you	316.1654
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register i have ita sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl	139.6834

he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	90.6660
morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit	103.4250
i hope so the friends embraced cordially dartagnan pressed raouls hand	564.5363
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father i will live morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment	67.7338
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to dartagnan	62.1812
dartagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him	107.2688
and you have succeeded exclaimed davrigny	282.2270
then all is agreed said she	41.5993
and now go mordaunt before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir a favor from me mordaunt bowed	76.7992
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	67.6859
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count	79.8418
the two friends made an appointment for ten oclock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone	83.7836
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out	203.1571
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal	309.0358
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again	61.0640
do you know count that persons of our time of lifenot that you belong to the class you are still a young manbut as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year	200.3191
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the counts pistol	165.0851
bonacieux help then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his	67.4050
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	107.8185
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure hell be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires	149.5425
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of dartagnan	126.3862
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that dayradiant with grace and wit	291.6458
what has he to say inquired the young man who was in command in the chiefs absence	76.6474
well well said monte cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind	76.9882
he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector	28.3365
morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the _pharaon_ of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor	66.4040
i shall hide myself in your cabin	277.9722
in the name of heaven run call aramis porthos call for help useless said athos useless for the poison which _she_ pours there is no antidote yes yes help help murmured mme	615.9509
they are beating the general alarm the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them	90.4188
if it is written yonder in heaven that the duc de beaufort is to escape he will escape and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it mazarin started	46.3901
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinals vengeance and as was well known the vengeance of his eminence was terrible	60.3387
thou alarmest me said athos who never used _thee_ and _thou_ but upon very particular occasions what has happened look you my friends cried dartagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind can this be another vengeance of that woman it was now athos who turned pale	266.3141
true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia	225.9739
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé	90.3100
i had better get on horseback and go and meet her	51.1474
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo	123.1000
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress	159.8966
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze	152.4378
when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sisters there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs yes said valentine i will now acknowledge you are right maximilian and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young girl sorrowfully	105.7099
i will denounce you before men as i have denounced you before god and if it be necessary that like lucretia i should sign my accusation with my blood i will sign it ah said my enemy in a jeering tone thats quite another thing	114.5769
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europethe english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed	130.1600
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible	107.4162
hold your tongue said he and let me answer	42.1299
the president read mr presidenti can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenantgeneral the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars the president paused and the count turned pale	94.1090
de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them m at the moment when davrigny was returning to valentines room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m	112.5359
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed aloud	211.7980
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	135.4894
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment	178.5406
those in whom the king has confidedlord levens highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once	249.7602
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked debray	249.9635
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer	61.4641
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is	164.0425
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz	73.2272
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was dartagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping aramis shook his head	107.9784
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voitures works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutorhe is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	150.8269
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother	65.3802
benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him	218.8890
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate	380.1796

i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave	28.7054
forward cried dartagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear	170.2525
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	91.8635
be satisfied replied felton he will not sail milady started with joy	125.0313
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol	56.5368
for a moment dartagnan thought that parrys brother had disappeared but he was mistaken	65.4823
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt	59.8525
on whom does my bleeding heart repose	1432.5911
the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless	86.9888
arrived at ryston dartagnan assembled his friends	13.1003
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldnt serve mazarin	190.8210
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired	104.8145
now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine ah well exclaimed châteaurenaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more	209.6304
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brotherinlaw but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you	98.7025
it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit	120.6680
at length milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence	138.3780
we are for the king and the princes added athos	118.6612
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you	42.2952
you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for meyou can have me triedand that is all i ask	94.6531
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself	308.7682
what then would be the use of all i have suffered	45.7346
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand	109.9205
there were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from athos porthos and dartagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them	65.4412
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right	136.1257
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful man did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there ah truly	75.3479
as for me i am sure of it said the duke	17.9299
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an armchair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearlgray and red entirely embroidered with silver	138.5257
that would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar sir cried de chatillon	59.9387
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret	591.5841
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects oh my lord my lord that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public but your honor will soon be called so generally i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak	124.9211
you are free my brothers free without my aid and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied athos	73.3287
bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life oh excellency no no but philosophy at halfpast ten at night is somewhat late yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive	145.7498
dantès easily recognized them faria had so often drawn them for him	95.3600
then dartagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this dartagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	100.8065
three days after about seven oclock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres	59.8524
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery	82.0945
milady passed her two arms round feltons neck and let herself slip out of the window	86.9946
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word	159.3128
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind	22.7189
and im one of the kings musketeers	85.2051
come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven oclock tomorrow morning vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage	59.8700
the th of february at halfpast two in the afternoon today is the th of july why it is but seventeen months only seventeen months replied dantès	81.3069
what he continued can i have been following a false pathcan the end which i proposed be a mistaken endcan one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking	349.1380
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway	95.8103
ah dear dartagnan see how regularly i live and how easy i am here	119.2743
those wretches wanted to take away my sword deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde	190.7132
what do you mean cried dartagnan	7.3447
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward	141.5462
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat oh this is what i feared said morrel	60.4683
i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own alas said monte cristo your words sear and embitter my heart the more so as you have every reason to hate me	137.5343
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead	69.9741
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti yes said morrel smiling it was the th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some m heroic action interrupted châteaurenaud	167.9564
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark	104.0561
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence	111.4497
has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	62.6254
dartagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind	62.8855
i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment	179.8768
no one would have thought in looking at this old weatherbeaten floraldecked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things ifin addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided withit had also a voice	329.3663
but contrary to all expectation when the st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision	130.7873
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre	19.5709
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themon the fragments of all the hope which god had given them i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them	122.8251
lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes chamber	66.9639
a nice acquaintance my friend porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the women gentlemen gentlemen cried dartagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious	57.7183
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction	208.8825
the instant she appeared the doorkeeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m	124.2397
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a halfopen door from which he could see the whole of a small room	98.7930
holloa monsieur dartagnan said he is not that you whom i see yonder dartagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy	38.3961
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber	34.7970
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have donei inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	145.3853
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about livres a year which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year at least	89.6075
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest	97.9856
bravo and you are not afraid of that athos no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest and with regard to the past asked porthos	75.0823
there is something so aweinspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe	108.5996
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments	28.7004
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold	122.4382
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door	93.4313
in a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thingand that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling	94.8649
cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count	108.4104
as captain of the musketeers m	331.5763
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room	96.3287
he found dartagnan waiting for him already at his post in the anteroom	135.0645
which asked he the viscount or the count the count oh exclaimed haydée is it not yet over i know not if it is finished my beloved child said monte cristo taking the young girls hands but i do know you have nothing more to fear but it is the wretched that man cannot injure me haydée said monte cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to fear and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord monte cristo smiled	55.2070
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word	98.2051
behind dartagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak	41.3136
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	281.9174
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him	78.0945
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory	376.8250
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow	90.8247
it was timetwo hours after he was delirious the next day he died and what did you do then what i ought to have done and what everyone would have done in my place	42.7044
monsieur is i am sure an honest man take away that fool said the cardinal	103.3674
while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound miladys hands together	231.8567
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound	602.9274

heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured	111.5982
ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos	70.6817
athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen	82.2233
but were you not on horseback	79.9777
well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is an affair of the greatest importance that demands my immediate presence in paris	82.5657
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man	92.2421
faster faster he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman	129.9086
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone	56.6387
come and open then cried dartagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle	79.1035
at the same time monte cristos voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champsélysées	91.9163
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman	121.8697
international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states	100.5068
and the steward followed the notary out of the room	47.8394
what is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queens head	161.6536
well asked anne of austria when dartagnan reappeared what does it mean it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left dartagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent command	69.2478
my god what do you fear everything replied athos	136.0134
and yours i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor franz dépinay started with surprise	179.1387
help cried caderousse i am murdered we are heretake courage ah its all over you are come too lateyou are come to see me die	338.3996
you wore a close ruff a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe and in that cap a herons feather	185.4452
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert albert understood his thoughts	86.8719
no halfconfidence oryou understand i know it from my wife monsieurfrom my wife herself who learns it from whom from monsieur laporte	226.9832
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc	757.2818
then he has neither the parliament nor the people with himthey represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of france dartagnan scratched his ear	130.6259
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench	140.3649
you meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics	1275.4489
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power one thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athosthe best friend of dartagnan	119.4929
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstancesgentlemen m	416.0733
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him	73.9165
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger and even this diamondsupposing that dartagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queenhad not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet	78.2280
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window one doesnt descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a limetree and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac aramis burst into a fit of laughter	135.4465
leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room	37.6439
danglars appeared delighted with you was he not	258.7250
you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier dherblay that i am altogether and always at your service athos and aramis bowed and went out	40.4966
you are right sir said athos	12.0419
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo	42.7909
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world	53.8444
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it	103.7597
must we then asked anne of austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the ministers proposal seriously	220.6771
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter	59.7402
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the poniard buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the infanta for king charles i who was then only prince of wales	149.0342
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking over public affairs	50.7947
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table	186.6259
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed dartagnan to porthos and went on his way	32.7249
you can restore it to his family said dartagnan	47.1892
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked	75.4529
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit	149.9158
the appointed hour was about to strike	31.1852
albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new toothpowder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering these papers become more and more stupid every day a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m	137.1508
speak then chevalier said the cardinal	14.9641
it is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	97.8208
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity	84.5353
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner	100.1363
come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine come i feel ill here and the two young men spurred on	166.6401
when she recovered her father was by her side	179.9988
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered	144.2401
the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms	93.2457
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy	37.2315
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married her	70.7887
it is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back	95.3623
could you let me hire a horse of you an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad	88.1142
there only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled	257.6265
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you	53.0696
let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it you are right but what are you going to do until this evening	48.2540
as the night before dartagnan did not return home till five oclock in the morning	18.1820
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants	129.0278
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	85.5325
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal well you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you i have my _full power_ show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name very well dont forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess to what purpose i am a victim of the cardinal	87.6269
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	558.1296
is there anything new in the wind nothing i thought perhaps that the kings death has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here what have you come for then to embark with you ah ah the general doubted my fidelity no but i wish to have a share in my revenge	92.0233
dartagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it	66.3931
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past	57.6959
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you sufferyou maximilian whom i love as my own son	158.3598
as soon as the earnest money was paid dartagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almostnew doublet of the elder m	220.8387
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you the devil said dartagnan whom the positive tone of m	103.9813
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties how is it all the better yes for his eminence will give you all that you wantland money and titles ah ah ah said porthos opening his eyes at that last word	87.3722
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement	284.2923
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two schoolgirls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m	202.1203
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your motherinlaw madame de saintméran heard her	88.4103
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed have you no letter for him asked the young man	142.1199
he said nothing but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me	59.1705
dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success	260.8371
he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak	25.4918
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life	47.5229
most likely said dartagnan i am one of his most faithful servants it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes a certain dartagnan a béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london do you know him personally asked the governor	87.2659
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice livres per annum from the day i was married	105.6681
tomorrow morning dartagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him	67.7474
and you oh i dare notshe forbade my sending for you and as you say i am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts	172.7109
to no one on my honor everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m	53.9336
that will do replied the cardinal	19.8595
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society she must go there whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert	163.7261
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	75.9277
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferryboats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to postparis presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions	319.4361
you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness	588.7461
what do you prescribe doctor demanded villefort	132.4312
gentlemen and citizens set me free i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin	97.9941
but perhaps you have never loved child replied the count	108.1198
but i could find nothingabsolutely nothing	173.0363
the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond dantès	51.0411
he will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been there	45.9846
well said the queen it has been refused the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	62.0813
what is to happen said porthos	12.0290
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained	92.5204
we thought it dead he repeated i placed it in the chest which was to take the place of a coffin i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste	81.5209
de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison	448.5048
danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wifes this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france	54.5813
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her selfpossession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now i have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true executioner	90.5402
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos	58.6524
i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information what day do you fix asked the president	70.8016
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door	74.9343
there is here no question of crime or treason	324.0697
there is a third and the most terriblethat is my condition as a mortal being	744.7759
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water	504.7710
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison	115.4105
i hope i shall gain renées favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me	431.0446
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat	81.1820
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression	165.7462
that is not all sir continued mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from mr cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can i do for you mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this moment mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make	87.0469
i am sure he will look like the great mogul they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses	273.1565
nay dear mother say the accused person	399.1832
after this he took from his cupboard the banknotes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night	66.5596
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldricin ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous	264.7357
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visitsthe bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villeforts departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind	231.2458
ah that is really original said beauchamp	38.7608
the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at rouen after which if nothing new occurs i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisylesec and i said athos am returning to bragelonne	159.0671
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad and you are not so any longer no captivity has subdued mei have been here so long so longwhen were you arrested then asked the inspector	113.0732
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder	215.1392
she had still her nymphlike form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with anne of austria over the moat of the tuileries in	100.9374
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists	267.8572
the steward gave him a gun this was what vampa longed for	520.6688
i will take him dead thats all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse	122.8640
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach	228.0583
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better	274.3797
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers dartagnan felt completely solitary	1017.9127
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m	66.0942
let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves	35.1310
they had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety milady was a phantom which when it had once appeared to people did not allow them to sleep very quietly	111.4311
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn	308.1949
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove mine one instant my dear friend replied the abbé it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength	82.0694
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting	107.6452
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting	84.8072
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villeforts dressingroomi saw i tell you silently enter a white figure valentine screamed	185.0726
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles	294.9632
what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be	47.5282
you promised to obey me implicitly	2210980.7500
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns	25996.0020
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more	116.2809
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all	90.2723
yes my lord and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal and we start in his carriage then yes my lord and with us no other escort but you two is it not enough	53.0621
oh as to that i do not engage myself	138.2877
yes before witnesses oh this is very interesting said debray if there really has been a crime we will investigate it there has been a crime said monte cristo	70.2777
noirtier the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded selflove and defeated ambition	663.7925
caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest	89.6695
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	333.4262
we have already wasted too much the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out	69.7617
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host	42.4293
by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars	678.0961
you have an excellent memory milady but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness	160.0429
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours	144.9899
sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them	78.6348
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly	72.5075
while the struggle between day and night lasted dantès still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the preeminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse	87.3349
two months and a half elapsed in these trips and edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other	183.0663
and sobeing beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and richand that is happiness sirwhy do you call me unhappy danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation	266.5138
ah replied he guessing franzs thought i know this is a serious matter what should you do in my place i who have nothing to losei should go m you would accept yes were it only out of curiosity there is something very peculiar about this chief then listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is truehe stopped to see if anyone was near	119.8368
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again	404.6859
you have been to sea yes i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands what of that	95.0752
he then gave himself up to his happiness	58.6705
i do not know replied dantès	69.8045
fortunately you have the sapphire the jewel is yours my dear athos did you not tell me it was a family jewel yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told me	54.4371
she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days	49.5462
m yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name	73.3516
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so dartagnan saw that he became pale	63.6595
de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted	105.1561
de villefort no madame no it was your granddaughter then was it not yes a groan from barrois accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the attention of m	142.3499
you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about dartagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it	120.3600
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos	123.6877
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away m and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo	54.5185
are we not eating a horse porthos	429.0095
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of heramorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her	198.1337
madame danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth	112.9049
andrea cavalcanti a murderera galleyslave escapeda convict an ironical smile curled the lip of eugénie	1517.2461
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently	173.6524
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction	1484.6278
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	85.5556
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million the count took into his hands the papers which danglars had so proudly presented to him and read to the governor of the bank	87.8214
a recollection of athos came into her mind	61.2997
when i like caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	55.6187
i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to dantès	103.4616
in a very few minutes the four bottles were empty and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud that might have rested on their spirits	218.5282
i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by	57.2164
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem	2896.2646
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne	193.0172
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than another	84.7714
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny	137.3336

my faith replied dartagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward dartagnan stood quite astonished	91.2133

dartagnan was conquerorwithout much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for forms sake	73.6527
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for levêque of latude from the bastille	133.2574

sir said de winter i thought i had already made you aware that i am weary of this persecution withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london	84.9371
how should he have been otherwise	188985.8438
corpo di dio monsieur dartagnan said mazarin you are worth your weight in gold chapter liii	66.5567
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see dartagnan	106.5191
she listened at eugénies door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place	81.4860
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner	6.7178
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m	107.8058
dartagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scrupleon the contrary thanking his majesty greatly	254.6102
i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	103.7365
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative	105.0171
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man	80.1509
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the momenta conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation	156.9338
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me	52.1451
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds	826.3182

i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice	64.3534
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	86.9629
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	83.7823
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave dartagnan uneasiness	125.0656
after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened	174.0982
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led dartagnan into it	96.2202
besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let planchet post himself behind us with his carbine planchet is a frondeur answered dartagnan	253.2145
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglarsexcuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery	136.6539

my dear friends said dartagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners it was not long before they joined the escort	82.2614
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	96.0714
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at dartagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of goodfellowship	79.8897
take twentyfive of them aramis and give me the remaining twentyfive all right i am glad to see you are of my opinion	56.7078

then he saw beneath a thick clump of lindentrees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawingroom into the garden	155.6780
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me	88.7709
at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down	106.5564
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it	70.0503
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of dartagnan and his yellow horse	83.8804
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eyeglass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a halfofficial air without smiling or speaking	426.6779

kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women	77.5021
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion	141.2278
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter	51.2554
as little sensitive as was the heart of dartagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance	115.6940
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abbé edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abbé edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la réserve oh yes i can see it all before me this moment was it not his betrothal feast it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested yes and up to this point i know all said the priest	88.7658

i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria	22.7356
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad alas sire it is but too true louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance	101.2626
i do not understand you i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him fernand cried mercédès i believed you were goodhearted and i was mistaken fernand you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage	99.3895
de morcerf with all my heart returned albert italian cigars are horrible	480.0586

fortunately lord de winter is rich lord de winter is ruined for the moment oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources now is the time when baron porthos would be useful now it is that i regret dartagnan let us entice them away this secret aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence	135.5948
very well what did i say to you	10.5051
ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey	866.8983
ah i wish i had never seen you cried dartagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason	299.5435
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to dartagnans chair	129.0110
then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me oh the voice of nature said monte cristo	78.4819
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening	97.3075
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome	1583.1741
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one child	87.2460
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway	284.6245
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis xi his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of robespierre he repeated this maxim of tristans gossip divide in order to reign henry iv when besieging paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls	376.4683
first one gunl goes under then the other	50.0333
_ma foi_ i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellowcreatures	452.3043

what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall	2389.2258
some of your people have committed the strangest mistakethey have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel i know it monsieur replied villefort and i am now going to examine him oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do	98.3954
he is worse than thathe is a devil returned the turnkey	35.8647
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food	402.2833
count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own maximilian you know i have no relation in the world	48.7224
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him	101.3379
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne	118.6708
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him	247.2254
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the senseit being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood	260.2120
at last his patience was exhausted	797.7971
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth	210.0256
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing	49.9934
mademoiselle de villefort is the culpritshe is the poisoner to you as the kings attorney i denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your duty doctor i resist no longeri can no longer defend myselfi believe you but for pitys sake spare my life my honor m	175.4841
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens	639.0666
and the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen	236.8172
albert listened with the most profound attention	2310.3083
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way	155.4533
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure	99.8959
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes	64.1235
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold	93.6403
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos	138.5105
can i be of any use to you chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	78.6759
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwells desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed	81.2147
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieuryou will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself	83.0652
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn	136.6671
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you	56.0120
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards franz are you m	94.3003
he turned ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street	37.4734

franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	153.8416
and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twentyseventh the name of porthos and at the thirtyfirst the name of aramis	140.8977
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrels entrance it was again opened for the count	64.5735
come then my friend we will go forward havent you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary and how long ago was that when i last drew my poniard ah good another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt	92.9372
for you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my son which recalled him to life almost instantaneously m oh do not place any reliance on that madame _one_ drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him	179.1895
come come cried dartagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment	143.3555
she is not dead demons do not die so easily	62.7556
you are laughing at him caderousse no he replied only hark how he sighs come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us	194.3339

ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six oclock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated	310.6933
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m	48.2265
has not your excellency heard that the french _chargé daffaires_ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri oh yes i heard that well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at portoferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered	186.6783
the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champdemars and satory	929.5181
we dress the king in groslows clothes	170762.5000
forward planchet forward you are a brave fellow as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used	134.6525
so dartagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply	124.7798
noirtiers happiness i interrupted valentine i shall not leave my grandfatherthat is an understood thing between us	178.9009
is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said dartagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome his father who is coming in his turn long live de beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass	62.5473
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years	56.5839
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	122.9750
the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig and if i deceive you bring me here againi ask no more the governor laughed	101.8857
the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word	126.1460
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the papers	324.0104
no one has _brought_ a letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of itself what do you mean blockhead i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom and where is that letter i left it where i found it monsieur	72.1268

no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence renée uttered a smothered exclamation	153.6212
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind	108.7430
oh lackadaisy im beginning to feel queer cried blaisois	1863.1388
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans	3972.9033

mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be	608.0067
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted	67.0390
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted	378.9572
ah my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us	128.7704
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column	61.8059
now as at the moment in which dartagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance	134.5571
the prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken	124.2954

she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the wavesthat immense breaking of the oceanwith her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on these verses were not excellentvery far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry	196.8428

take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay	130.1050
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice dont touch them devil take me if i taste one of them murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry there was silence	86.4894
i beg you to do so replied albert	31.7847
my dear mother said he do you know if m	44.2824
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself	168.3022
yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare danglars smiled at the goodnatured pleasantry of the count	99.2587
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying if she had committed two crimes i would say here m	145.8747
you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain	136.8425
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	81.1578
the accused replied that his name was jacques michel bonacieux that he was fiftyone years old a retired mercer and lived rue des fossoyeurs no	180.1438
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him oh count said de winter for whom do you take me for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way de winter shook him by the hand	51.8459
you have then decided to come to england again said lord de winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in paris never to set your feet on british ground milady replied to this question by another question	99.4118
the house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here yes my friend returned the count and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master oh monsieur said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all what was the name of your old master said monte cristo	57.3977
wait an instant my friend and you shall be satisfied	28.7514
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am mme	74.4698
as dartagnan had foreseen athos was not within	40.0222
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by dartagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them	77.1485
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here dantès whirled the stool round his head	152.6397
down one of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of light were visible	91.1883
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer entered	96.5883
let us return to your apartment	336.8129
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again	95.8356
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the kings attorney but can you not say that sir	78.3405
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and mannersa freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables	217.5765
that will fall in wonderfully well you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the queen then the cardinal added _a propos_ sire do not forget to tell her majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her chapter xvii	97.7591
i assure you i intend to play the devils game tonight dartagnan rattled the gold in his pockets	235.2044
let us understand each other my lord replied dartagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake	46.4771
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection	116.4785
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress	69.8995
nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself	134.4590
and what brought you here i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort	142.4660
there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself	145.7390
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queens dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicionabove all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again	125.6562
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne	222.4244
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand	73.9046
at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads	140.6019
in fact her position was terrible	844.5950
well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice	51.2932
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands	32.7959
bonacieux that he had never spoken to the one or the other that he had come at about ten oclock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend m	37.0432
and truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying the baroness and him	149.5138
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught	108.0147
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks	57.3786
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saintmérans morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear	96.8322
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	215.5932
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs	550.7291
de villefort her devotion to the elder dantès	90.2819
dartagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands but i spare your life for the sake of your sister dartagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face	82.1141
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down answer	57.0576
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape	94.3774
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused	133.5526
without your aid continued he repeating the counts words i should have been a dead manthrice dead my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	99.4705
de monte cristo yields his right of using his we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion	73.0729
will that satisfy you must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	219.6825
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felons life might live as other men	120.4221
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again	45.4939
as i am very poor and am not afraid of being robbed i went and opened the gate and saw three men at a few paces from it	54.6155
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel	135.1190
i have resolved to fly with you not a wordbe ready	866.8946
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m	59.4969
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name	79.5883
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him	57.4199
help help he murmured oh god have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud	91.9437
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis	65.9329
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy	89.8076
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me alas alas what a fearful extremity valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother i would rather die a hundred timesoh yes die no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope i will think of maximilian you are my own darling child valentine i alone can save you and i will valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her handsfor she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courageand began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress	155.0904
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort	24.9124
yes shall my father be informed of your wish yes do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately yes then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa	77.3635
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him	182.7998
de châteaurenaud has also the honor of his acquaintance but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa what of that why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner oh yes and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner to be sure i remember it all now he called himself vampa	89.5304
and whatever might beconsidering the violent character of miladythe danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her	113.3778
come said the captain we have done all in our power and m	75.9165
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixtyfive years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	128.9885
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	69.0962
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth	104.4750
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again	188.6173
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor	280.3628
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought dartagnan	116.2971
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine oclock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it	59.2459
i say _there_ for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there	154.3140
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead	62.5187
coquenard did not seem to observe it	83.9569
what is he contriving asked aramis	18.6587
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton	406.5652
and he is very rich i am not so sure of that and yet you said he had money fifty thousand livresa mere trifle he is well educated hem said monte cristo in his turn	102.9455
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the kings attorney	249.3597
what are these things replied anne with queenlike dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful	448.6772
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return	257.8299
you have never seen our africans count said albert	1030.8643
why said aramis onehalf were hanged and the other half were shot well i said dartagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot	86.3504
what doest thou here goodfornothing she said and why art thou not at notre dame i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazins permissionyou know mother monsieur bazin the vergeri came to speak to monsieur broussel and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way	153.0520
no for your skill with the sword is so well known ahwho has betrayed me the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered and you failed they positively refused morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol never well we have time look monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club	157.1556
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was dartagnans mount	1066.1084
and madame de villefort two m	359.3091
_avanti_ said the same sharp and imperative voice	533.7844
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice or even three times than they should be misunderstood	95.6615
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment	42.0347
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions	861.0721
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn	624.6580
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england	90.5603
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said	119.2500
quite quite alone replied the manor at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment	138.6962
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real	105.1548
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressingroom with mademoiselle cornélie	222.4814
the aldermen of the city give a fête on the third of october	109.5555
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini	76.7709
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou accepted	166.4653
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her halffainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream	123.0196
you he said you how did you penetrate hither	836.3298
de blacas i must change your armorial bearings i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this device_tenax_ m sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience	243.0340
the general depended much on it he even came to force m	150.4048
if it be so we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position and if it were an interrogatory replied the cardinal	104.2761
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass	144.2479
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip	138.5775
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master	60.8845
de blacas taking his hand restrained him	78.6070
wretch said he to the young man who since the death of buckingham had regained that coolness and selfpossession which never after abandoned him wretch what have you done i have avenged myself said he	87.4473
its tiresome work to keep awake a whole night yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream	217.5536
dartagnan and the englishman dartagnan followed milady without being perceived by her	224.1788
the sea continued to get calmer	1764027.3750
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use	76.7308
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister	942.4395
and aramis i see you have not forgotten the name no she said poor aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses	301.8083
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	88.5814
molière had not written his scene in lavare then	3188.8000
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris eugénie covered her face with her hands	82.6878
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls the duke smiled	539.4449
you understandno more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	48.3378
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded	124.0624
my lord has forgotten the supper no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present go on then have it your own way come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	108.2359
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	114.1780
and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which faria had related to him now open sesame chapter	159.3322
de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus	63.1886
i hate him i confess it openly	4011.7039
at this point grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet when he found a spigot he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard	218.9581
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope	237.6451
reflect that i am your wife you are a poisoner in the name of heaven no in the name of the love you once bore me no no in the name of our child ah for the sake of our child let me live m no no no i tell you one day if i allow you to live you will perhaps kill him as you have the others ii kill my boy cried the distracted mother rushing toward villefort i kill my son	68.4951
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him	126.7916
come this way gentlemen come m	200.7856
they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of braccianos ball to which all rome was invited	59.3606

now if you will come on board m	114.0344
yes i will tell you all but take away the young man i cannot endure his presence he is going with me	67.7683
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of dartagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady said he	40.3916
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms	81.6169
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us all replied mordaunt	69.6959
on on forward forward cried dartagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five minutes and they darted on anew	131.3042
admirable and dogmatic repeated the curate who about as strong as dartagnan with respect to latin carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him and repeated his words like an echo	116.2722
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m	76.2982
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought	178.9534
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	85.8739
athos you have done wrong but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer	58.6269
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column	94.9367
the first idea that occurred to miladys mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant	117.2281
athos said she wait a moment and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment	69.5791
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds _ma foi_ my dear sir replied franz make no apologies	203.3117
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love	395.1411
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur dherblay	88.7683
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise	42.6387
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	109.1994
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	108.6265
oh i am a christian cried dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him	99.2962
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward	58.6485
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning	211.9190
do you understand that my dear franzno horses he said but cant we have posthorses they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting what are we to say to this asked franz	187.6594
and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m	93.8230
he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done	108.2965
we have no time now for suspicions said athos	979.7090
theres only the price we are not agreed about how not agreed about said caderousse	147.1880
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	31.4328
here are thirty francs i will sleep at the _cheval rouge_ and will secure a place in the first coach	251.8920
m who could know that i was here already said the young man	37.3444
thanks dartagnan thanks cried aramis almost in a state of delirium	57.6810
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme	119.2939
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m	152.7072
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends	37.3106
once out of auteuil andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity let me ask you why you deceived me how have i deceived you how do you ask	59.7968
cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends i am at your service sir replied the major	49.0145
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something	67.0331
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the carriage this did not take long	47.2014
no before a woman you would dare not fly i presume remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything you are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses	91.8898
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	201.1422
noirtier said madame de villefort besides they are to come to paris in about a month and valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m	105.1631
what is the meaning of that noise oh my god cried morrel turning pale what is it a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and halfstifled sobs	122.6025
come porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business nothing good replied porthos	49.3801
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive	75.8252
oh my god my god what has happened lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us sir said chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him	105.1604
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	37.8394
the dead are everywhere said morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles	60.4615
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty	357.9322
that is good to see said aramis	84.5646
in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in the massacre of st bartholomew in and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generalsla rochelle is impregnable except to famine	189.5461

we are not such devils as we appear to be	14.0639
my faith said dartagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to m	116.7442
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents	196.0814
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair	133.9075
that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champsélysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner	60.5492
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward	97.7793

the prince read as he hastened on	92.0975
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it	140.9018
i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the _arabian nights_ a wizard of the middle ages but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence	224.8286
do you think athos will be sorry to see us oh cried porthos oh i understand wait a little porthos before crying out for on my word you havent reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone	117.2382

monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face	79.4684

now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker	133.8522
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m	70.2003

then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse	111.5429
but his majestys decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours dartagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeers uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it	235.4793

he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror	64.6575
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth	178.7883
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period	226.9689
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting pistols then at eight oclock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being	144.3585
you and how by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring	617.8450
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants	185.9039
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life andrea visibly changed countenance	160.3607
is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself yes miserable wretch cried morcerf it is your fault danglars retreated a few steps	140.2404
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth	233.9433
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness	585.5234
now go down said the abbé folding his arms	77.4860
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly	56.0191
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles	772.2227
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter	206.1916
i am like nero_cupitor impossibilium_ and that is what is amusing you at this moment	15.2642
did you ever hear of such an idea monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face	116.4537
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza	141.7991
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right	69.1827
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart	67.8530
i will go to the queen and louis xiii opening the door of communication passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria	34.3124
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so	64.6069
all that which a man wounded in his selflove could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurators wife	59.8221
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said dartagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right _animadvertuntur in desertis_ a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal	105.9849
no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say	83.3494
holloa said he what does that mean if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal	108.0933
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door	33.9255
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascons uneasiness	281.6175
ah may you be a true prophet said dartagnan laughing	129.1389
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming and the two friends began to laugh	54.9121
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass	122.6199
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so so much the better for himhe will suffer less said the inspector	120.2150
edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber	52.7652
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said dartagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make _sorties_ and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans	82.4766
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales	219.8900
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence	106.2111
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure	64.7537
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance	74.2870
now for the tallyho athos threw himself into dartagnans arms	26.7753
you had begun to pervert my poor felton	61.7104
shall you keep it or send it back i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it	75.9714
really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort indeed m and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing	79.4441
but to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat danglars without telling them there is a stranger	165.9018
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars	98.1363
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	80.6943
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countesss box	126.4435
ah you lose ground you are turning	112.2233
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	100.7378
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	97.2781
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly i am mate of the _pharaon_ belonging to messrs	46.9734
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride	170.5187
yesterday morning madame coming as usual i presume from the extreme end of the globe	108.5156
the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices	1048.0400
it must be nearly four oclock	16.4735
albert beauchamp and châteaurenaud remained alone	102.8333
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m	73.4668
danglars in promoting a new railway line you m	662.4423
then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you	79.6990
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad augury	1592.5575
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back	44.6975
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio	426.7485
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with all sir have you the keys they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions very well and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you you may go but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken it is only fifty thousand francs everything included and your fee is included in this sum but have you not come from auteuil here yes certainly well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count and he made a gesture of polite dismissal	74.8638
what is that exclaimed the queen	15.8260
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	709.4072
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	656.9081
certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocketbook	61.4329
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme	102.1763
no madame the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes	235.5903
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed	63.8565
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m	66.9060
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn	225.2465
no this is his blood where were you then where you left meunder the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all	119.0700
to be sure for monsieur de wardes now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur dartagnan go to bed mademoiselle said milady i dont like comments dartagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in	94.9593
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful	119.3981
are they all full grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty dartagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captains alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment	145.4524
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m	75.2271
you must be cruelly bored here that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you whats that it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventyfive pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice	65.9376
they reentered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud	85.4991
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today a fine pleasure indeed monsieur upon my soul everything degenerates and i dont know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no noses	190.5868

what are you sent by general oliver cromwell the most illustrious captain of the age i have this instant left him replied mordaunt alighting in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold	109.0356
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep	135.2974
i shall be at vendin to place it in position	49.5729
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf	115.7896
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles	66.7694
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all knowpoor franz dépinay ah true said debray you did fight some time ago about what m the devil take me if i remember returned châteaurenaud	105.3776
a greek murmured the count of morcerf	25.7276
there had been no stipulation in her favor	67.0817
what to do there would be a very simple means very natural tell me what to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you but where can i wait oh there is no difficulty in that	103.4012
de monte cristo knows everybody five millions here is his receipt	144.7974
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal	224.1892
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	185.4257
the evening was no longer joy but delirium	655.7426
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades	469.3063
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort	50.8150
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve oclock	126.6970
she had fled with him from her convent with your brother yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death	153.0944
the fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next day was a dead hen	123.6315
look at me well in your turn	102.6636
empty he exclaimed the infernal demons we must pursue them said groslow they cant be gone far and we will sink them passing over them yes but the fire ejaculated mordaunt i have lighted it ten thousand devils cried groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save us mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it	115.3781
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us	99.1763
but dartagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him	124.6691
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket the casket would encumber you	115.2179
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change	76.8369
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow debrays example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous ah you do not know with what i am threatened	90.0276
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace	226.7180
i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching	372.4091
and now said dartagnan to athos entertain no further doubts about me i undertake all that concerns the king chapter lxiv	144.5858
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon	360.6115
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen	80.9152
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	242.2055
they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty what do you fear vasiliki said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud	129.0350
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread	49.8496
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemmathe one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold	466.8253
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said	21.7667
it was the marquis de saintméran	19.7755
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son	90.6398
you have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her	447.3770
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest	80.5021
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head	174.0711
come athos said dartagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the gascon	53.1120
you see i cannot escape even if i intended unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know i do not look round you then dantès rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the château dif this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor	130.1452
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word	69.6447
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m	77.3706
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m	90.1624
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others	86.8358
lord de winter perceived nothing of this	14.2262
of intrigues and secrets of state continued dartagnan complying with the recommendation	120.1465
aramis pushed his back into his saddlebags and sheathed his sword	345.8219
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth i consider it lost well then i will buy it of you you yes i but at a tremendous discount of course no for two hundred thousand francs	94.3720

as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold why so asked mordaunt	129.9201
hold hold i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were i open them again and i see what you are nowa hundred times more beautiful what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances and upon what then must i live	97.7017
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him oh father i exclaimed you are very good but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me	85.7367
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it	196.6086
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse	19.4377
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly not well then and so he is in paris yes and what effect does he produce why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle marss diamonds and so people talked of something else my good fellow said châteaurenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	135.4584
de motteville will not be astonished at this reply	60.7988
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration	232.1288
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him	84.5557
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear	87.7476
dartagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step	93.0921
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never	1311.9618
a waxlight placed on the mantlepiece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	216.6328

he will indeed give us the favor of his company you will i hope be grateful for it porthos do not lose sight of his eminence aramis then joined athos and dartagnan who were consulting together	71.5257
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice and he is in the fort levêque said the king	66.5041
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together	193.5558

the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again	72.4855
de monte cristo is our enemy replied mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered her	119.2777
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino	144.7758

these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos how many have we killed of thema dozen or fifteen how many did we crush under the wall eight or ten and in exchange for all that not even a scratch ah but what is the matter with your hand dartagnan	91.3666
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives	142.8960

there is the little door opening into the garden	72.1856
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it	74.1215
tell me now if persistence is not a virtue my faith but this is droll cried dartagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter	82.5785
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spotthe appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening	223.8284

he was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them	187.3645
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself ah ah can it be on account of the amours of madame de boistracy said dartagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs	72.0049
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain the hostess who knew dartagnans skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair	82.6193

it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highlycolored tinge of his own heated imagination	90.6474
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger	144.4947

coquenard who knew that a simpleminded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal	212.4969
de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on mea favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman	186.3713
nothing but saddles now do you understand said athos	13.3519

did edmond make you his heir no merely his testamentary executor	11874.1973
the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing him from arrest there has been no arrest how it is sometimes essential to government to cause a mans disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv	188.3508

she thought that lord de winter would perhaps send felton himself to get the order signed by the duke of buckingham	53.8263
he would enter into the ministers schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity	402.4019
the escape was fixed to take place at seven oclock there was therefore threequarters of an hour to wait	40.0454

it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot wait said caderousse we shall see he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcantis hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself	104.8853
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven	474.9909
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the months end nothing is gained or lost ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all i can understand that said dartagnan	130.7385
eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly	49.3998

it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a threecornered hat	245.1178
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy	30.4374
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but i conjure you do not abandon me	95.8430
danglars sold yesterday at and pockets francs	716.4151
i shall soon return and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as i have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late i will come back and reconduct you to the louvre thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied mme	68.9551
ah it is you monsieur what do you want of me she asked in great distress	72.5476
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine oclock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priests breviary	133.6908
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it	118.4448
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him	74.6777

tomorrow perhaps he may change you	14.3060
bravo count bravo it is frank at least said morrel	205.9847
he he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung not so foolish as all that ah muttered athos i may be mistaken i havent the unerring eye of dartagnan who is speaking of monsieur dartagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room	63.1600
dartagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated	145.0780
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i dont know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself	73.1293
this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox	385.6544
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock	240.5758
alas he said to himself if i only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul	189.7348
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber	43.6650
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night	83.7180

we have walked eight paces whispered dartagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery	131.5138
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy ah said mazarin breathing more freely	98.1466
in order to make ones way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman	200.7981
she revives cried the young man	1.0955

they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles	253.0247
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	96.2847
i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived	39.1046

de morcerf has any enemy mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my father my son she said persons in the counts situation have many secret enemies	105.8615
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them	124.0610

monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawingroom now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea	145.5994

adieu till we meet again apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make dartagnan shudder but dartagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt it matters little now to me	109.7068
you smile yes why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	55.4501

soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers	125.8371
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	133.2583
de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him	57.5194
he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire	755.5581
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man	30.4307
i am finishing the most execrable mornings work what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently my papers thank god nomy papers are all in capital order because i have none but m	290.7733
m ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed	83.9470
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you	57.6437
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	447.8051
dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was guarded	130.3526
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall	115.3320
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for dartagnan and an ace for himself	162.8468
it is by his courage please observe by his courage alone that a gentleman can make his way nowadays	395.8481
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days so added he turning to renée judge for yourself if it be not important you are going to leave us cried renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement	83.3331
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m	2095.3286
julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawingroom with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allées de meilhan	75.7741
personally i do not know you this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	107.5344
poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately it is a poor lame posthorse in what state was the house when you left all was quiet but on returning from m	106.9851
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me	83.8893
oh father do not look in that way at me oh i am guilty then you will not pardon me the monk recovered his usual expression	73.0499
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinnerparty at auteuil he slept soundly	181.8622
it is true he had been playing the day before playing the day before and with whom lord who can say monsieur	150.3188
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	60.8345
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me	58.4315
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars	151.9515
whether noirtier understood the young mans indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him	127.8167
i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark true said porthos	244.3558
but you said that your name was dartagnan who i yes you somebody said to me you are monsieur dartagnan i answered you think so my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it	95.8420
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but selflove but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs	137.4727
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward	103.0411
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the mans countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing	159.1589
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the counts that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes	69.7353
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright	190.9215
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes thats true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i dont doubt	113.9901
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve	1315.0916
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin how far is mazingarbe two miles and a half thank you grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man	94.7779
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for	41.7143
the result was that even if the kings troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege	139.5719
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them	239.7406
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness	392.8790
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner	121.9899
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me	51.6261
i was mistaken said the host hes not quite dumb	271.5486
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him	83.2054
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive uswell it will be the worse for you	93.1159
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you	58.3351
what chance brings you here gentlemen said châteaurenaud shaking hands with each of them	24.6878
anne of austria took two steps forward	72.7416
oh pray for mercys sake dont fly from me	28.7318
i am no swordsman well dont be alarmed if i return at one two or three oclock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter	52.4182
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to milady	66.5797
but continued aramis the details escape me and me also said porthos	85.9567
dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of the camp	191.5207
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair m who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young mans ears	83.8356
you do not like dantès i never like upstarts then tell me all you know about the catalane i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries what have you seencome tell me well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping blackeyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin really and you think this cousin pays her attentions i only suppose so	156.1403
i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nîmes we are getting to the story now yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary	68.6314
good you may be easy thenyoull get there dartagnan then saw a musketbarrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters	276.1278
so that he told me that poor monsieur maillard go find the coadjutor friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir say then father bazinthe heir of monsieur maillard the giver of holy water at saint eustache hey i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms all the same i should like to do him that servicewhat do you say to it i will tell the coadjutor said bazin	100.4455
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	98.6630
and aramis said the duchess quickly	912.3776
give him the despatch raoul you are the chevaliers prisoner raoul gave it up reluctantly aramis instantly seized and read it	221.8098
you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied dartagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me	78.8734
you have spurs yes but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away	39.6663
ah if we had been five murmured athos thinking of dartagnan and porthos	134.7331
for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks	90.0495
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived	71.9039
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments	1671.4843
do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse	78.2653
not at all prince said monte cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have i done for you	77.4898
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand still if people will shut themselves up said albert and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen i am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house yesterday i was at your house sir said the young man because then i knew not who you were in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby	104.0526
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost	82.6750
thats all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos	106.8385
i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortunealone with that strongwinged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet	421.3469
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him	70.9198
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette rue tiquetonne and there await me thats agreed said porthos	74.7676
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key	64.4536
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio	533.1470
at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_	260.8410
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs	264.5843
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of supplies mousqueton said dartagnan you must render me a service what monsieur you must give your recipe to planchet	117.8193
what hinders it exclaimed the king	13.3989
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow	83.2918
an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count	45.2562
the groom cried aloud for help	140.5732
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep	198.5984
their vows were sacred and irrevocable	2200010.0000
oh yes with all my soul well then listen valentine said the count i have a favor to ask of you of me	55.2179
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	152.4284
do you know that i die tomorrow at ten oclock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment	93.2625
now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very day	158.8120
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone	154.5889
and now raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits i had forgotten it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you what is his name i did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be	72.2589
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out	46.4411
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed air	101.1999
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the sofa	747.6506
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him	47.8565
whose is the sand upon which we were reclining	45.4290
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again	137.5100
what will our two friends say	285.0059
you must dress him up during my absence	186.1601
one thing only puzzles me namely how franz dépinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife	110.1223
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow	41.7956
de morcerf so early had you not a meeting with my son this morning asked the general	55.7763
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve you serve the cardinal yes madame and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart	72.5287
a great favor zounds monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin no matter said dartagnan in his most wheedling tone	49.8135
oliva corsinari was it not oliva corsinari a marchioness a marchioness and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family yes that was the way it ended and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you said monte cristo	96.7532
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table	134.3495
what will you do with the letter then asked porthos	68.2007
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances	112.0217
we have seen them at villeforts they proceeded then on their course	424.3332
dantès must be crushed to gratify villeforts ambition	15604.0059
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see after the worthy mercer later	202.9429
then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you proceed said monte cristo	41.2474
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room	94.8613
dartagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen	333.8244
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of itdeny it boldly and you are saved be satisfied i will deny it it was the only letter you had it was swear it i swear it villefort rang	162.0368
morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what the money well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest thanks my friends thanks cried morrel gratefully take ittake it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman	128.1873
in fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the cape of corsica and so elude all further pursuit	219.6972
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers	80.2671
yes my lord how much were they worth why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me a thousand pistoles i said a thousand pistoles porthos exclaimed	86.3791
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger	106.1535
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop	170.1313
de tréville was the father of his soldiers	52.8416
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	104.5864
de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it	97.9879
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed you are here in the apartment destined for you madame	51.8449
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspectors visit but a dream an illusion of the brain	171.4124
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the foundation or pglaf owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg electronic works	30.1469
you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation	57.0193
a door opened through which the attendant and the baron disappeared	145.5067
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	54.8570
is he a deputy oh no	14.5798
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	110.8780
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression	136.3986
m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	92.6273
_au revoir_ then that is all i have to say today	67.0825
this time dartagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was	99.0320
tell me he saidtell me what you want well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back andrea turned pale but said nothing	73.2387
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance	159.7622
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows	171.8407
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home	106.1830
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni	141.0908
ah madame said comminges hastening to dartagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector	48.4175
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse	274.9167
it is done gentlemen said athos	10.0941
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat	306.1749
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battlefield	164.0675
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him	187.8768
oho said he is the hotel on fire on approaching the hotel of the roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected	91.1585
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière	238.5929
when in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held secret	227.1730
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled	119.0484
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight	88.3801
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits you	124.5921
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause	220.3158
latterly i heard his friend monsieur dartagnan give him that name that is it madame that is the same	47.3302
i dont think so answered the other hes too stupid to imagine such a scheme	168.6192
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale	54.3726
oh how distinctly i remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead	85.2749
here we are said monte cristo it is only halfpast ten oclock come in certainly i will my carriage shall take you back no thank you i gave orders for my _coupé_ to follow me there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage	49.0216
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	221.1313
then if he persists notwithstanding all thisas that is as i have said the limit of my missioni shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france	116.8732
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm	124.3509
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers	426.8030
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced	375.9391
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated	223653.2188
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce dartagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos	65.7358
oh oh said dartagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer	77.7892
tell mewhere there but listen to melistenand you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you oh you frighten me but speak i will listen you recollect that sad night when you were halfexpiring on that bed in the red damask room while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery	142.3384
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet	68.4555
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot	447.3132
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them	90.7120
make haste and dress yourself in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you yes that i have suffered but the culprit that is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate but peppinowhat has become of him peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion	97.5218
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk	263.4040
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet how my friend planchet	224.7543
de monte cristo he is admirably adapted to revive ones spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters gladly said albert let us calli love him chapter	460.9670
what is his name count albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome in what language would you like me to converse with him monte cristo turned to albert	46.4704
the intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	155.7325
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act	31.3767
but stop i can manage your business for you	31.0911
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athoss closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords	106.9924
i claim then the right to choose my opponent	351.9967
the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him	491.5709
oh mon dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one why not because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird unfortunately that is true	153.0690
but dartagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers	162.2863
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me	103.2254
napoleon would doubtless have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of and the senator of protected him who so lately had been his protector	127.5462
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up	187.8092
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m	169.9850

i cannot endure the modern school of painting you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great faultthat they have not yet had time to become old or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canovaall foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur they are your compatriots but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other	175.8992
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man	26.7845
de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together	413.7091
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince	55.6586
at length with a violent effort at selfcontrol the name of that woman he said	44.0760
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings i presume you will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin tomorrow so then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken of course said dartagnan they began the day he was sold and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures and you know added dartagnan that whenever i catch him i will kill him this mordaunt and i too exclaimed porthos	92.7231
besides i shall only take the time to go and return yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him	63.3980
franz dépinay an expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes	55.7458
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors	295.7482
well i will live if you promise me still to hope and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my strength	84.4351
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony	126.1618
but even while they watched his daring progress edmonds foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear	131.0939
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me	136.2605
come come my little fellow dont be angry	332.2820
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string	155.4106
my whew thats a frightful place that bastille only to think of it makes my flesh crawl	324.7762
then extending his hand the old man said i thank you my son and now leave me alone yet replied carlini	65.5752
_pardieu_ said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels	879.5210
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	84.7544
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selims fiery lance	153.3534
de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be what does he appear to be why you have just saida man of high distinction i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such but what is your own opinion albert i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese i do not ask you of his origin but what he is ah what he is that is quite another thing	78.3698
i was dancing the galop at torlonias with the countess g then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped	75.4566
albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up	56.1725
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struckit was empty	283.2804
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything	93.4000
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it	113.3043
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained francs	32.3139
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open and the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk what monk the monk that was shut in with me no he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window	62.0043
come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter	22.0817
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel m	132.1422
villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his brow	8.1832
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence	580.3286
i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it	76.5570
the first part of the entertainment being concluded pistache was desired to say what oclock it was he was shown monsieur de chavignys watch it was then halfpast six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised	275.1169
speak you kill me be satisfied you are not guilty toward me and i have already pardoned you what next	79.3259
i told you so exclaimed madame de villefort	7.5936
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools	140.5430
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel dartagnan began to recover himself little by little	114.9381
it is for me to reply to that and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn	57.7533
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance	64.1996
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them and you were wrong madame	87.1922
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one	96.7545
de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heartbroken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent	92.8058
la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood	63.1493
de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held	48.4256
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	177.2718
bad monsieur bad replied the king i am bored this was in fact the worst complaint of louis xiii who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say monsieur soandso let us weary ourselves together how your majesty is bored	122.4070
i will profit by the advice and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	195.2919
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more who i am madame	101.2232
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimauds ear	335.5129
necessity has no law besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least	148.2317
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper	73.4863
on the sixth day the smugglers returned	496.5483
he borrowed this from _don quixote_ the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered	358.2087
with what ideas does that letter inspire you oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that m	89.3385
benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains	517.1544
you then served louis xviii and you did not show any favorit was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect himit is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself	134.3468
well my dear friend win itit is at the point of your sword	86.6514
the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon	73.5815
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain	119.1444
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society	136.6405
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	173.4489
but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of dartagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer	80.9450
dartagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale	404.3399
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brotherthat is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	220.8390
but look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of athoss horse	77.9694
dantès instantly turned to meet him	1.7543
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you alberts freedom what influence can i possibly have over a bandit have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten what is that have you not saved peppinos life well well said the count who told you that no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant	86.8172
they went towards the forest and soon entered it	91.7332
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her	102.1818
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseauyou rememberthe mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger	214.4418
m well baron said he here i am at last some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker	119.2658
whom the man we are seeking it seems said dartagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries come replied the same lofty tone answer are you waiting for him underneath these windows	144.6747
at the extremity of the wood dartagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle	68.6365
did you drink some too m	232.7687
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	114.0047
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions	124.2990
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused	64.5624
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	118.9628
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again	108.7289
he committed a crime it is true but he repented of it and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont	184.2218
this evening your destiny begins to change amen exclaimed dartagnan stopping the carriage	61.8590
coquenard turning about in his chair a real feast _epulœ epulorum_	4597.8931
who goes there cried a hoarse voice	65.2385
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his headif anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three daysif anyone had said to either of us then livethe day will come when you will be happy and will bless lifeno matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulityand yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing youhow often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasivelook at me	160.1366
monsieur de lillebonne lead my horse by the bridle if you please as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full trot the carriage drove on and dartagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner	42.6551
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity	55.8183
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him	50.0411
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the _parade_ he had already three inches of steel in his breast	116.3379
they are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel very well and youwhat will you do ii return to paris what without chastising this insolent boy asked the lady	122.1521
oh sir reply i entreat youis not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis xiii who must be now about fortyseven or fortyeight years of age yes sir you are right in every particular and who served under an assumed name under the name of athos	90.1561
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal	78.9129
an hour after her table was cleared but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the soldiers	106.1017
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentines room opened and monte cristo reappeared	56.3701
they went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden	154.3241
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing	216.9194
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness	81.8364
read then for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause	95.2510
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme	511.8052
proceed was heard on all sides	84.2404
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog and yet meyou see plainly that i love you you say so i am an honorable man you say so i am a gallant fellow i believe it i am brave oh i am sure of that then put me to the proof mme	60.7055
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway downin vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground	152.4508
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his fathers or in his cabin on board the _pharaon_ very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the kings attorney and thats all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke	124.8765
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening	214.6350
sblood does that astonish you and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method	89.8834
he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust	1133.8745
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	24.2103
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	89.5849
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate	84.2009
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what	51.3160
valentine oh heaven forbid woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy on yourself then unhappy man on yourself i am the only guilty person am i not said maximilian	141.1491
at this moment the clock struck eleven	164.7352
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his homeyes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house	207.9135
but said the count so great was ali pashas confidence that on his deathbed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave	83.7785
on arriving at the extremity of the castle dartagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv and surmounted by four stately gilded weathercocks	211.7464
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning	199.9939
i thought i had been deceivedhad mistaken the spot	3680.2371
heigho said porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur dartagnan is waiting for you in the stables porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well	65.7201
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step	70.0021
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m	68.7705
at nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to arms	144.8318
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m	41.7837
how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars	183.5423
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too	118.6753
to questions frankly put said he a straightforward answer should be given	159.7072
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings	347.8210
laws alone swamp our small staff	48100.5898
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it	72.5196
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her	72.7182
but in what force was the enemy	101.3244
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor	758.7363
dartagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down	80.6345
would you like to become rich or at least independent	505.9233
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall	142.3352
you only know that this money exists	1511.9811
by her step she must be young perhaps she is pretty	94.1599
porthos murmured dartagnan look well at that priest yes said porthos i see him	51.6666
happiness almost stifles me the two friends began to dance around the venerable st chrysostom kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis which had fallen on the floor	120.9201
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the customhouse officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aiguesmortes	138.0523
here i am wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us why all these precautions you shall know milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme	67.6600
de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m	101.6241
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw everything	219.5324
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which dartagnan bowed as a sign that he listened	66.7406
the count went out first then albert	368.0067
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony	153.0296
de villefort i beseech your indulgence for him villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism	210.7858
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false angostura is it not inquired madame de villefort	196.0371
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy	252.6337
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer	153.7974
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm	56.7344
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what i mean yes sir	74.1563
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count reentered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his masters features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word	74.8657
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon for if hes a coward he will disgrace thee some day monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammonts regiment and i refused to accompany him monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said dartagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong heres a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him i will cut out thy tongue	156.4793
the duke exchanged a signal with them	52.3451
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his hand	94.9824
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource you are right valentine but how shall i ascertain from the notary m	82.5363
presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault	123.1536
they pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin	161.6507
they must be enemies he is right said porthos battle	158.1409

it was just five oclock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear	74.5565
this woman is certainly a great liar	15684.4668
rather say that you have a new love not so i speak frankly to you	178.7589
it was in this pavilion on the ground floor that dartagnan and porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament	125.9973
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom _errare humanum est_ is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body and you will find traces of poison no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies what do you propose to me davrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my houseimpossible still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish itif you demand it why then it shall be done	120.1005
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear	109.3714
go go i implore you and return hereafter come back as ambassador come back as minister come back surrounded with guards who will defend you with servants who will watch over you and then i shall no longer fear for your days and i shall be happy in seeing you oh is this true what you say yes oh then some pledge of your indulgence some object which came from you and may remind me that i have not been dreaming something you have worn and that i may wear in my turna ring a necklace a chain will you departwill you depart if i give you that you demand yes this very instant yes you will leave france you will return to england i will i swear to you wait then wait anne of austria reentered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with gold	121.1360

and my faith the governor of the provinceone of the gentlemen i expected todayseemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him gave him cried dartagnan	91.6817
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion	174.8612
farewell he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	23.9709
but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women	106.9734
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches	141.8909
have you then power against death	392.5378
m the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamoretree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain	93.5139
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life	47.5097
the young girl looked at morrel	248.0329
the felucca is mined said dartagnan	2.7801
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots not badly answered ifaith said gondy laughing but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur dartagnan the lieutenant of musketeers asked gondy	131.6437

monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours which you please monsieur said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past seven thirtyfive minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking	106.5749

de morcerf at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene	76.6880
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency	233.8570

i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young ladys eyes swam with tears	114.3232
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the gascons blade terrified them	192.9741
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive	233.0733
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried dartagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to reenter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which dartagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse	93.7396
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its silence	789.5137

but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament	148.5288
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action	108.6035
here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment	119.9115
he was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return	90.5204

bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said dartagnan	38.1006
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest	133.6973
but the dead cannot return their fire certainly not they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls	121.4324

the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips	105.9176

those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not	35.0944

at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance	106.3900
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road	74.0805

at the sixth cabaret then as we said dartagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him	102.6140

no be assured i am not mad	194.2343

mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and dartagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	151.8994

the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	226.9419
danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage	49.2109
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees carlinis features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side	89.3160
dartagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he dartagnan and his friend had rendered to the queens party in the morning	64.7307
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m	107.9062

it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you	126.8490
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast	105.0614
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo	41.0604
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him	175.5737
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise	61.6726
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited but dartagnan with his gascon imagination saw in it his future fortune and passed the night in golden dreams	125.1505
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take	57.5826

how was he going to find athos	214.3332
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss	103.8141
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death	39.3100
de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	163.7042
now you are rich said monte cristo	4.6124
my profession condemns me to celibacy	3526996.7500
goodday monsieur dartagnan said planchet proudly	2056.0068
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a mans face	224.7667
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle	27.5558
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard	75.0643

mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a basrelievo representing an equestrian statue	262.9364
yes said cromwell you have done since i knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave soldier do you remember sir it was my idea the scotch treaty for giving up the king yes the idea was yours	95.4518

albert sprang out bearing his _moccoletto_ in his hand	49.0184
send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall judge only replied tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue cannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution	189.2056
here they are monseigneur there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it	61.7133
de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure	92.2976
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him	52.2283
if i am killedwell then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes it is well replied mercédès with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy	69.0860

porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale	36.4719
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man	15.8591
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo	103.9650
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments	76.1316

on perceiving the count he rose quickly	267.3365

he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	102.5657
thank god you have come eh goodday dear friend replied dartagnan	84.3338
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us but this fire continued franz	72.4966
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles did you ever see mercédès again inquired the priest	87.3602
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything how ought she really to be supremely loved she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently	157.3968
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard	74.6648
monsieur said mademoiselle daubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voitures friends	90.0121
here we are said the gascon	58.8457
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois porthos the second to marry an attorneys wife and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abbé	111.0344
i think nothing i quote a fact that is all	32.9101
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression	157.7946
it was ten oclock when they arrived	54.3162
has your excellency anything to ask me said vampa with a smile	49.3639
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his buttonhole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged	86.3337
as i told you it is an old family jewel and yousold it asked dartagnan hesitatingly	265.4612
is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the treesthat poor innocent offspring of mine which i never even kissed but for whom i wept many many tears	354.8117
andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the bankers house in rue de la chaussée dantin	104.9495
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieuxcolombier resembled a camp from by six oclock in the morning in summer and eight oclock in winter	49.7849
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me yes monsieur said the englishman bowing	63.1647
i not only permit i desire let them come in the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	94.1409
de villefort yes sire and he comes from marseilles in person why did you not mention his name at once replied the king betraying some uneasiness	72.9905
how so returned the count with surprise	217.8775
his house has been full ever since	888.9669
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured	163.7120
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket	52.7217
cama the pilot of the _saint ferdinand_ went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali babas enchanted cavern i tell you what i have been told then you advise me to accept oh i dont say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the matter franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted	116.4653
with the deputys knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence	95.9404
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure	140.2830
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him	92.0304
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	552.3357
i should find myself therefore more at my ease _facilius natans_ in a subject of my own choice which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy dartagnan began to be tired and so did the curate	293.6296
m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display	375.6714
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities	245.2351
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask	145.3049
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp true my lord exclaimed la ramee	46.6876
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m	103.7967
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf	74.9040
excuse my not coming to meet you but added he looking at dartagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me no has the host told you nothing then i asked after you and came up as soon as i could porthos seemed to breathe more freely	68.7018
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	226.4474
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened what is the matter sire exclaimed lord leven	66.7672
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and dartagnan was a gentleman	82.2196
let us talk like men he said looking at the count	37.4212
the queen walked first every one followed her	93.5054
now as dartagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his	151.1938
m what is he doing there said the inspector	50.1004
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty no no blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and _pardieu_ you know his fathers name his father yes noirtier noirtier the girondinnoirtier the senator he himself and your majesty has employed the son of such a man blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension	159.6936
the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any	252.0881
well he said to the lieutenant	3726.0769
de tréville entered the kings cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip	116.9276
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate	25.7536
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible	118.2493
let us start then we need no witnesses very true said monte cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see	57.7688
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him	124.1198
noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you	34.1635
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham	63.7825
go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me bernouin bowed and retired	79.7733
john felton i trust your word john felton i put faith in your loyalty my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance	105.4131
has he any friends then he added aloud did he make any resistance no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance to whom did he give up his sword he did not give it up he broke it he did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage there was a momentary pause	68.3728
he will come and visit the comte de la fere dartagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him	49.2986
here it is answered the other	106.0472
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon dartagnan when he spared the life of her brother	118.6171
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent	85.2006
one step farther into resttwo perhaps into silence	494.0578
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle	100.4112
what say you to that crime of which i have the proof she was my mother on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune	96.1947
must i use any password to procure a horse only dismount another will be immediately saddled albert hesitated a moment	280.0208
_diable_ he said after having swallowed the divine preserve	525.6974
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first	85.1520
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers	83.9732
but here is the letter very well said the prince give it to me later	43.4090
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed dartagnan aside with his hand	81.6315
de tréville captain of the kings musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis	79.0629
come come sleepy head quick the ladder but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window the other one the gardeners	155.0988
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers	55.9706
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimauds shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them	99.7955
look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the wall	96.8899
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness but your eminence replied the prince	106.3410
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one	96.8239
she found milady with a smiling countenance	2325.5012
was that it if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said dartagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavyfor with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery at all events answered dartagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinals they beat them when they draw their swords he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money	108.6322
these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the secret	87.8524
the boy found him sitting where dartagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary	59.7404
fifty thousand francs muttered la carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune volume two m m m chapter	98.0694
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husbands inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door	92.0886
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimneypiece they were a pen ink and paper	117.1158
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy yes replied aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess i once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us	92.0567
at six oclock the curate of st merri was announced	121.5720
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux thats true	156.6036
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully	176.8485
spur your horses whip get on the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body	144.2236
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmarethats all	225.5533
night came and at ten oclock they anchored	1331.1514
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	124.4569
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort	123.4369
are you a man of imaginationa poet	772720.3750
he said very good muttered the major thensir replied he	198.9553
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say why yes replied dartagnan with embarrassment	79.1459
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference	192.5045
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m	68.9395
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	84.4284
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days	50.4024
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him	77.5963
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind	33.8111
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology but alas but what the paragraph was correct my friend what	112.6732
dartagnan and which she had given her son secretly	305.0407
nevertheless to dartagnans great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely	3063.0498
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter after all the disclosures which were made this morning m	143.6143
do you find yourself badly lodged sister	40425.1094
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them	68.0365
faith no thank heaven replied raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering i fear we arrived too late	165.1954
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom	108.4764
at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles	288.0909
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge	182.0260
but what has happened then since last evening count the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi i have seen a ghost and that ghost told me morrel that i had lived long enough maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other	158.1244
come said boville with a tone of entire incredulity five millions to that gentleman who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me perhaps he knows you though you do not know him m	77.8173
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor	112.2961
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which today we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years well in spite of that dartagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her no indeed said dartagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance you see then dartagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is athos said dartagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven so then said athos offering his hand to dartagnan	82.7319
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill	110.3247
ah how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh tis a noble gentlemanmonsieur athos yes true as gospel said dartagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities i remember well said planchet he was fond of drinkingin truth he drank but not as other men drink	114.1239
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose	111.1486
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself come and sit down close to me said milady	55.6213
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peaceloving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air _à langlaise_ and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures	506.4814
have you seen alas did you recognize valentine groaned	247.8673
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron	465.3791
at nine oclock the president of the club presented himself the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage	59.9953
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another	93.6709
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga	215.5336
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon ah my dear m	103.9646
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come m you think then all is not over yet said albert horrorstricken	230.0641
four men surrounded him besides the postilion	298.7351
but this i know that i had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by nightsilentlylike cowards	867.3345
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction	286.1245
and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure m	500.4404
the next day was spent as usual	155.0559
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed	85.2762
my god my lord i have long despised thee pardon me my god receive me oh my lord caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan	75.2623
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired	161.6069
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the customhouse officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew	150.3679
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the contraryand it is i who say itsee enemies in all directions	155.3740
yes without accident perfectly safe and sound porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal	124.9455
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment	362.3885
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs then sell outsell out marquis or you will lose it all m but how can i sell out here you have a broker have you not yes then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instants delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price	95.2940
it is the talk of all paris and you count have made this match asked beauchamp	169.7411
i understand you fernand you would be revenged on him because i do not love you you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk	110.5715
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome and you reply i do not know and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son	96.4241
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	175.5200
sir began raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil	126.2343
debray who was present at the explanation valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer	67.3331
yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucienand considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures	91.3609
yes a chef doeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos	1241.2126
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian	247.9136
both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them	290.6971
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building the dog again shook his head as if to say no then said the prisoner lets think who it can be	75.3495
m high walls not more than eight or ten feet that is not prudent said caderousse	35.7725
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically and why her rather than another because a mistress is one of the cardinals favorite means he has not one that is more expeditious	121.2125
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m	113.2855
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat	190.0815
whatever may ensue i will go if you are determined said athos do so but the bastille said aramis	67.6730
dartagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side	7.5287
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold	161.4898
yes if i am killed said albert laughing	63.0310
de villefort villeforts eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride he took the cross and kissed it	58.8832
now as a quarterpast one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes mercédès will have become madame dantès m fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company	73.7743
dartagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance	51.7078
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related	94.7540
the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine	83.7505
he took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his finger	50.7313
i therefore may hesitate between you	40.5578
stay where you are i will tell you mme	160.8673
i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us	106.7672
from twelve to two oclock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker	253.5062
well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m	62.2795
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	93.2563
it is you mordaunt he said	23.3155
who knows said gondy such men are like thunderboltsone recognizes them only when they have struck every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart	104.6066
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commencedby the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it	82.4389
he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country some contribute their talents others their industry these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause	776.5570
the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mothers room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door	92.2383
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	110.7102
you are not angry with me not the least in the world till then then till then bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick pace	81.7290
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there	47.9213
ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you	58.5344
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin	70.1306
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits	53.2931
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon	68.9013
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same questiona stupid one i admit but very necessaryhave you any money something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoula young man must live respectably	196.5179
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited	196.6989
i am the abbé faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this château dif since the year previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle	70.5250
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself	37.4875
you have to do with that woman we four will go and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number you terrify me athos cried dartagnan	102.7434
porthos opened his mouth to reply dartagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	229.3828
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so dartagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door	213.9278
no dear morcerf you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible	84.0267
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others m	84.6570
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles	372.1293

my letter of recommendation cried dartagnan my letter of recommendation or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten	119.5229
in france the first fear of the king of england charles i on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the rochellais he tried says richelieu in his _memoirs_ to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure	132.8098

noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretchhe therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest why what nonsense are you telling us said châteaurenaud	115.8079

and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous so young said albert forgetting at the moment the counts command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέspeak nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness m speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile	122.1989
in after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band	99.8890
mercédès drew near and plucked the fruit	166.4196
you have done thisi hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees	27.1963
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him	78.2370
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use i would make of it oh hear me to the end that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercys for pitys sake i will embrace your knees you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you my god to youthe only just good and compassionate being i have met with to youmy preserver perhaps one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door	121.3588
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	58.0359
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear	65.5505
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined	479.1270

but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter	77.8473
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan	100.5407
dartagnan shows himself as athos and porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour dartagnan returned	43.2115
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt and he threw the money into the river	75.5395

it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it	330.5240
oh do not deny it answer continued milady	786.3004
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek yes such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball was he not a finelooking man yes of lofty stature yes of pale complexion and brown hair yes yes that is he how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man	100.1037
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	119.0968
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again never see you again exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julies cheeks never behold you again	177.7373
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do that is it replied the cardinal dryly	62.9539
sit down there before me dartagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen standing and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed	85.8812
stay said dartagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw dartagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms	78.5311
excuse me albertsorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance	391.6945
there is a man after my own heart	50.5413
it was danglars letter to the kings attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m	37.2597
i hoped to be able to rely upon that and i madame said dartagnan embarrassed you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way dartagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme	92.1944
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence	64.8193
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girls head already her cheeks were becoming red	181.2951
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	101.9421
are you not rather young m	110.3576
i dont say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind its a sure way to prevent its coming true how so why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny	127.2715
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table	119.3877
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward	25.2180
the three friendsfor as we have said athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himselfwent out early in the morning and returned late at night	131.0128
yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boyslayer not too much so replied dartagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you	117.6549
greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence all eyes were turned towards athensit was the fashion to pity and support the greeks	301.3349
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle	114.6095
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly	68.3752
what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffledup individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom	93.1834
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes good he accepts said monte cristo	101.9171
blaisois found bazin donning his beadles gown his services being required that day at notre dame	163.3485
but first let haydée be informed that i have returned here i am said the young girl who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely	63.7639
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed dartagnan with a look of astonishment what danger i am told that there is a general insurrection the uniform of the kings musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns did you witness the injury sustained by comminges monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards the cardinal smiled as he spoke	97.4331
he turned it gently on its hinges	1019.1099
one plays with anybody but one fights only with equals and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice	57.4000
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand	91.7580
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him	48.1612
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès thats all right edmond	104.5295
châteaurenaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane	213.9772
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question	116.0376
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria	208.4358
sang diou let them come on besidesdo you see that door athos yes what then well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air i recognize you there my brave dartagnan replied athos but you are no longer our masters	103.3031
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask assistance	227.8684
alberts attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed	154.4986
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you	32.6638
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis	25.2284
thats a daring rascal whispered the count	1.5901
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the customhouse officers	134.5281
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce youwith your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received	107.2553
he went with groslow to the captains berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by captain rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat	101.9005
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	261.2404
and now when are we to go asked athos	36.8125
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me bah exclaimed monte cristo thats a fine reason to give	51.7365
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	30.2150
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him asked aramis	58.7666
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak	13.0699
stop a moment cried dartagnan pray how many men have you on board captain i dont understand was the reply	166.1019
porthoss chamber is you say on the first story number one yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that i could have let ten times over bah be satisfied said dartagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard oh monsieur procurators wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier and did you convey this answer to your guest we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission so that he still expects his money oh lord yes monsieur yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post do you say the procurators wife is old and ugly fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathauds account in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be softened	127.5966
the knife fell to the ground	334.9666
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty	109.2969
at your age no i was drunk	275.5410
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the bankers feet he could not have experienced greater terror	62.9653
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the lawthese advocates to promote your majestys welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	125.9525
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which i had undertaken to watch valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred yes said valentine besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m	136.7901
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon	100.6687
in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was marie michon said madame de chevreuse hastily	52.7041
alas said dartagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to meto me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile	122.3838
if you deprive me of that take away my life also we are forbidden to shed your blood and by whom are you forbidden by him we obey you do then obey someone yes a chief i thought you said you were the chief so i am of these men but there is another over me and did your superior order you to treat me in this way yes but my purse will be exhausted probably come said danglars will you take a million no two millionsthreefour	123.6291
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows	148.9526
were it liquid gold monsieur blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine	255.6064
a dinner in the old style	1123.8324
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor	98.8849
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m	136.6273
but let us be quickthe king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort levêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in m	74.9101
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum ah sir you know well i would risk my life for you thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet	196.3654
well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness	177.1792
davrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret	151.4613
dépinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m	132.6048
were you not already rich enoughyou who possess nearly a million	648.4597
then there is his son andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his fathers millions	125.3445
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbés room ah no yes no repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name	79.7246
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word	96.5834
yet i let him die what do i say	22.8850

we cannot say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly	70.0599
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods	160.6593
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart	105.8821
but cried felton that is a _fleurdelis_ which i see there and therein consisted the infamy replied milady	247.1254
those fellows strike hard and dont leave off in a hurry	99.2585
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation hush said athos speaking in a low voice	22.1516
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his deathbed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime	165.7918
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant and here i am said the sergeant	62.3567
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case	284.1683
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside	81.8072
about what time why about fifteen or eighteen days ago exactly so and yesterday evening he came again yesterday evening yes just before you came my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies	135.4366
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine but in what carriage do we start i have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty let us go to the king dartagnan bowed and followed the queen	53.1802

but presently the exempts face suddenly brightened	6528.5386
unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action	155.0133
danglars said another sign in the negative	69.4501
i am in a hurry to begin	246.2365
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you	109.9782
he called for dartagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him dartagnan not being on service	133.3515
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country	532.7322
patience madame i am coming to it thats fortunate in april you went to dine at the ministers	96.0992
i will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent i read the note and sat up to await you and he will be guillotined will he not said caderousse	107.1625
you are much pleased with yourself said he to raoul when they were alone are you not well yes replied raoul	78.8920
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle	126.4324
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night	67.4245
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden	124.0385
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is magnificent	178.2548
let us talk a little said she	69.2358
what are his means of existence	1788.1271
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blundersi mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more is there indeed my good fellow	193.6869
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse	253.9267
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man	32.3687
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	93.9457
delightful indeed you could not belong to him	20.4757
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink	72.1780
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty	94.5721
poor bruteaccustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia thats why you want to purchase my english horse said debray you think he will bear the cold better you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa you were very much frightened then asked beauchamp	129.9988
milady wished to please the abbess	2408.2334
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung bravo villefort cried the marquis excellently well said come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten	190.1046
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo	239.7448
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night	59.1424
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he	88.6430
comminges turned and saw dame nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand	208.2488
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside	222.0276
teresa had a great desire to see this ball	40.9488
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette	106.6734
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives	334.5348
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish	73.3570
just heaven what have i read cried the duke	43.6569
no and yet they refused to buy it why said châteaurenaud	58.6497
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and delbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have	106.5593
when quite a child the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity	2091.8884
as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fête she was received by the city officials and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy	95.9543
the opinion of athos was that dartagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish	70.2061
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristos opinion the villains sought his life not his money	120.2971
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw dartagnan who stood expecting her	80.3593
there and elsewhere the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow	101.5400
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horses tail and thus they took me to nîmes	159.0971
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was	85.3988
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck	497.0685
your eminence said comminges as i was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door	113.9861
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelidssee our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back	240.8077
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse yes truly dear friend and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly	110.1775
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the nightlight held it up as if to test its transparency	129.2517
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth certainly agreeable undeniably witty he has unfortunately too much wit well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man because he is an enemy of whom of the cardinal what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man	116.0341
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	950.9976
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down	45.7581
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis	15.3743
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriagewheels as he was driven rapidly away	87.1434
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret	3213.5466
i think i understand his reason said morrel	61.8903
come let us talk a little about my father who then am i you siryou are my adopted father	211.4858
there is halfpast ten striking albert m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp	73.1775
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse	197.6154
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said dartagnan	66.1416
the ballet of la merlaison chapter xxiii	403.9206
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber	150.8308
sblood cried he to dartagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you	25.0949
you think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles	339.1857
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition	108.7603
all this showed dartagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this veil	116.3213
i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple come aramis said dartagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of buckingham mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing	119.1620
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated	37.9637
its little enough but so it is no it cannot be are you my friend caderousse yes in life or death well i will tell you a secret what is it but remember ah _pardieu_ mute as a carp well i think andrea stopped and looked around	96.7104
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur dherblay i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me really monsieur you say strange things said aramis	76.6675
then he took away his mothers portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	300.5268
the halfpistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket	49.3977
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris	37.9832
yes you i know you now	106.3299
yes sire and yours monsieur dherblay yes sire as you wish then	59.2348
i followed her i caught her i bound her and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother	164.5236
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds i have nonenor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts what has happened said the count simulating total ignorance	238.3177
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall	114.5535
beauchamps i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	45.6534
may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars m i have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred	97.7853
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon perhaps returned the count smiling	67.2621
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside	88.9610
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no faith said madame de chevreuse say on	61.9136
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down	55.2496
is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarchs _life of alexander_	852.8843
who and what are you demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hours time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim	181.2642
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck halfpast four	107.5099
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this morning chapter xvi	109.5117
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois	175.2086
dartagnan held the bridle of athoss horse and porthos that of aramis	88.9694
the man who abducted my wife the cardinal rang a second time	35.2401
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent	107.9672
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation	81.8866
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	124.0648
perhaps you would prefer being alone no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the operaballs	138.0362
this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse	820.1724
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitors cross that lesser criminals were executed	195.7787
davrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered	71.4736
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	170.1339
the money is nothing that letter was everything	194.5944
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful	432.6277
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel is it a very beautiful vessel i would not wish for a better to sail round the world of what burden is she about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather	129.8463
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m	163.5178
and as the man approached dartagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern	53.9345
doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast	89.9922
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champsélysées to the house of monte cristo	53.2884
morrel and then ran on to mercédès	8455.9971
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends dear dartagnan oh how he will thank you i hope so	55.6883
albert rejoined his mother she was very pale	48.5036
the blood no longer flowed from his wounds	48.4781
but take no notice we know all about that well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple what asked dartagnan	50.2001
well did there not happen an event which saved austria	251.0683
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done	48.3341
my dear la ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart i say what i think there is no compliment in what i say to you then you are attached to me asked the duke	58.0438
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate	172.8622
goodnatured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate	205.9322
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on	183.1457
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassins wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain	95.5584
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword	17.5677
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake	440.4048
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine paintingbrush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen	99.9801
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited	120.3031
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited	94.3111
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars	153.4234
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph	160.7081
thank god we dont want either rope ladders or gagpears now my lord said athos do not let us disturb you	94.3197
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time	65.5859
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine	525.5725
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp is it not it is absurd said debray	142.8560
be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for youfor you as aramis athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear	233.5009
aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that dartagnan and porthos might enter	185.8784
the curate related the incident to the count of sanfelice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month	68.0094
and i am madame héloïse de villefort the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time	31.1266
morrels clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek	187.5057
the performance of the civil marriage	154.9734
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	202.4958
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mothers neck and kissed herher own eyes streaming with tears	196.7809
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	128.9489
well she is a monster who at twentyfive years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals	107.3214
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme	113.9503
you understand this do you not my most precious wife	351.6652
ah why were you not there gentlemen	1292.4072
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties	132.6349
de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saintméran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles	85.6172
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet	41.3846
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	292.2068
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness	94.3465
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saintmartin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren	235.5932
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done mordaunt bowed humbly	95.3544
do you then love mercédès i adore her for long as long as i have known heralways and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition i did not think that was the way of your people what would you have me do said fernand	91.1856
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach	685.0337
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise	43.0000
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel	43.1768
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion it matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs	126.2679
well then we will go into paris	186.2134
the man of meung replied dartagnan and disappeared	30.9288
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows	58.7140
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat	135.7086
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world	74.4965
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other yes in favor of some member of your family no do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary	111.8959
i am a priest resumed aramis	22.5141
as was his custom dartagnan presented himself at miladys at about nine oclock	122.4214
she raised her head with an effort	79.5678
when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence	166.4504
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move	98.6106
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death suddenly about nine oclock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying	118.8639
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	45.1143
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study	95.0158
noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning _poor m	1749.1339
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued	208.0121
captivity the first day let us return to milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of france has made us lose sight of for an instant	51.9789
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion mousqueton smiled disdainfully	179.9325
my faith everything considered you are very well off here	76.5877
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier	188.4015
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief here i am said vampa instantly appearing what do you want take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocketbook and let me live here i ask no more for libertyi only ask to live then you suffer a great deal oh yes yes cruelly still there have been men who suffered more than you i do not think so yes those who have died of hunger danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed	94.1452
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters	70.1153
embrace also our good and brave porthos	369.3494
in a second i had disinterred the box then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i doublelocked carrying off the key ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery no your excellency returned bertuccio it was a vendetta followed by restitution and was the sum a large one it was not money ah i recollect replied the count did you not say something of an infant yes excellency i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box	79.9762
the sentinel who was relieved at six oclock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him	47.6914
de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that dartagnan had received from the duke of buckingham	32.9224
a cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal	7.3915
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum	149.5278
the joy of the king was lively	467.9374
but your excellency wished to know two things what was the second the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes the story will be very long excellency what matter	89.7655
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos for i madame i may say i was your victim when wounded dying i was abandoned by the surgeons	121.9420
my jeweler and my secretary the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply	106.0349
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so	78.1197
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew	142.9433
your hand madame your hand and i depart anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her	68.5682

for pitys sake cried the young man whose agonydrawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble	487.2124
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment	92.4956
i will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved go said valentine whatever happens i promise you not to fear monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her	68.7676
oh _pardieu_ less than nothing said aramis a charming little seamstress whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake the duvil said the swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade aramis read the letter and passed it to athos	196.6057
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of	85.7572
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side	63.1350
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else the devil all this is very sad which you tell me what will you	69.8125
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees	119.5757
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	135.5762
monsieur dartagnan said the commissary addressing athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur dartagnan whom you show me what not monsieur dartagnan exclaimed the commissary	91.6276
m the boat continued her voyage	2967.1113
_peste_ edmond you have a very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile	69.0075
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse oh exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish	138.3549
he went toward the place where he had left him	24.6630
dépinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family	191.6217
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful operaglass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass	205.6267
the three friends burst into laughter	65.2262
nevertheless you come as one in authority because i happened to be in the antechamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance	99.4513
morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last halfhour to tell me that if his ship the _pharaon_ did not come into port on the th he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m	135.5374
you know the vessel is lost the _pharaon_ sirthey signal the _pharaon_ the _pharaon_ is entering the harbor morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheardof fabulous facts	345.5473
m i am sorry to see observed monte cristo to morrel that i cause no small disturbance in your house look there said maximilian laughing there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat	129.0500
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelleenserval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place	85.9528
unfasten it or i will break it in said grimaud	104.3426
do you want any money no sir i have all my pay to takenearly three months wages you are a careful fellow edmond say i have a poor father sir yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	86.9896
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk	46.9316
young edward a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continuedyes gentlemen edward the infant phenomenon who is quite an adept in the art of killing you are jesting not at all	298.5750
where is he ill very ill say you	115.2310
could you allow me a few words in private what did i tell you said the governor	36.1241
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful	261.9428
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him	83.0256
it is certainly the king said the man rising again	56.9688
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me	72.9421
and then besides the useless blood never no never i have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it hush said dartagnan the some one is coming the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule	104.6614
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way	53.3361
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself	168.0270
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts	2025.8424
what could put such an idea into your head yourself ahwhat next most assuredly i should like to know upon what occasion oh _mon dieu_ that is very easily done	266.6841
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me this voice startled her	112.9656
so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection i said porthos i will do whatever you please and besides i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good but your future career dartagnanyour ambition porthos our future our ambition replied dartagnan with feverish volubility	132.7258
monsieur dartagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least	86.9693
say rather crime replied the doctor	85.6535
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort	145.6503
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at all	62.6854
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saintjeanauxbois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest	89.7303
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors bah much monsieur mordaunt would care	80.9169
if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you but inquired dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves no no be easy on that score the family is extinct	153.0508
but one word more count what is it advice be careful advice is worse than a service oh you can give me this without compromising yourself tell me what it is is my wifes fortune five hundred thousand livres that is the sum m	109.1105
albert and châteaurenaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first	61.0179
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady	195.9357
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it	113.7508
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte	180.1638
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes	176.3821
never have i seen you look so young so beautiful the duchess shook her head	114.4192
well monsieur he is still here ah _pardieu_ my dear dame said dartagnan springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life where is this dear aramis	52.2871
back shouted dartagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistolshot was heard aimed by dartagnan and one of his adversaries fell	132.5799
baron danglars follow me said the man	13.5640
four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two oclock in the morning all the cargo was out of _la jeune amélie_ and on _terra firma_	133.6549
you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them i should think so indeed if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo	65.4664
at two oclock the tennis balls began according to grimauds directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over	111.1370
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one	100.5078
dartagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying no sir i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look outwell then look replied dartagnan	74.4358
privately yes well i will remain with you at this moment villefort returned followed by the ladys maid and after her came madame de villefort	80.4718
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her	92.3806
i have no right to it	458.4479
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord	94.8667
i my lord said the latter i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt	122.6634
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend twothirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended	142.8239
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount willingly then it is settled yes but where i have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature	131.8346
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramees unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	323.5574
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	52.6407
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort	148.8241
what a confounded country this england is this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal what do you think dartagnan asked athos	67.3312
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point	66.9437
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor	438.0009
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves	95.1445
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	202.2521
but dartagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valetdechambre with a smile on his lips	42.2140
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet	478.6835
what asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of pistache	107.6689
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window	95.4988
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned	252.9841
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressinggown	470.9973
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole	68.7505
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous mazarin was superstitious	192.2992
do you expect news from him i expect himself himself	137.7879
at the end of the second day m	126.2035
meanwhile let us sit down and eat caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor	335.6174
a little farthera little farther said the other	7.8622
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champsélysées which had already assumed that palacelike appearance which the counts princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences	117.1989
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her	70.1613
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle bravo cried porthos	138.4671
the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtiers old servant who had heard the noise from his masters room and run there also remaining behind the others	98.6203
then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure	114.7591
they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room	147.0580
and what friends awaited him without	142.2744
i waited your orders said dartagnan crossing swords	396.6729
bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully	5426.5151
good thought dartagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddlebags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend	78.6724
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina if the news be inauspicious we must fly this nightbut supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so said my mother	179.1577
madame de lannoy whom according to your majestys command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day thats it cried the king to him no doubt	115.4490
ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind	186.8982
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips	159.9927
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword	74.0183
nothing nothing only shut the window	29.4757
i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held	220.6413
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter	106.5804
thats well said athos let us go home and read it the note burned the hand of dartagnan	78.6131
the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided	216.6488
you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon i hope have news that will be agreeable to you grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior	72.7848
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous operabox more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a kings ransom in his waistcoat pocket	547.4617
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtiers lips seemed to start from his eyes	91.6691
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it	489.6411
my faith i dont know much about it said athos	62.0194
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle there was no one like him for that and now replied dartagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	105.8607
we are alone sir said buckingham speak my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson yes sir and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign it here it is my lord give it to me said the duke	76.5482
if she seduced your brotheryou said she seduced him did you not yes if she caused his deathyou said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner	115.0367
what cried dartagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos yes that disturbs you by no means and here is the second dartagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis	97.1530
these gentlemen are with me said winter	2707.7683
come come tréville hold your tongue said the king	34.9380
i only ask you one favor and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next speak to the master madame said felton happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing	162.2414
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained	114.6506
it was alas the ghost of former greatness	381.1502
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired	263.9185
come my friend said he courage then he turned to the officer	123.2740
locusta and agrippina living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of the roman empire sullied by so many crimes	111.0734
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets	88.4345
remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish	131.7523
unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition	334.2571
madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other	64.4676
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all	78.0970
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawingpaper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarins life	461.5417
no cried porthos there go three or four limping away in fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city	149.1080
you see we were quite right to pacify that country yes but don carlos well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time about what about the papers my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers then you will dispute the more m	107.7297
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained	114.0303
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the ironpointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators	192.0474
here edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years	65.1410
i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée	115.4661
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head	64.1222
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood	76.2169
de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess	100.3810
as the day advanced the tumult became greater	1011.6768
for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse	135.4728
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer	413.5182
i must go thither tonight instantly that is to say when you have received my instructions	64.0995
who can possibly have told you i had had that dream	69.9522
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellowcreatures	134.5977
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemiesthe faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin	100.6982
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an orderfor you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak	155.8990
what is it said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock	256.4160
de villefort has just confirmed m	290.9695
well said she you see he refuses yes but why need this annoy you you know albert women are singular creatures	205.3418
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the counts house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved	107.0650
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too	110.3809
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscounts age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert	102.3721
joy joythe sum is large five or six millions is it not yes you know the amount on the receipt of the count of monte cristo why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this i told you we were informed beforehand then why do you apply to me that i may be sure i have the right man yes it is indeed he	45.7103
he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited you know not the subject of their conversation he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london was this woman english he called her milady it is he it must be he murmured tréville	92.4951
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children	180.1921
this rabbit dead the abbé adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day	514.8632
now sir i am listeninggo on i will come at once to the point	27.2882
noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door then that of the bedchamber and then extended his hand to villefort who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal	60.9111
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	23.3620
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man	3.1725
i wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment i felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible	102.3414
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man and not more than justice either you ass could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coinerssay yes monsieur you are right said the host	93.1257
go young men go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely	2100.4915
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues the two young men looked at morcerf as if to sayare you mad or are you laughing at us and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon ah cried albert it is very lucky that m	123.1963
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of dartagnan cruelly mystified him	106.0246
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty	127.7241
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbés cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue	90.4529
as for me i will give my last sou for it	203.8950
well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt what love asked the young girl	48.1984
morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection	174.6913
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work	70.2926
and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie	212.3461
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her	1012.4996
what is it that we really desirethat which we cannot obtain	1069.0869
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror	224.6047
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of gods mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my fathers tomb by your fathers tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and halfraising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death	98.5430
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life thus dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth	313.4344
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation	235.3173
i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask	157.5782
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation	93.4582
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	90.6062
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time mme	89.9776
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest	205.4133
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality	89.5189

athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street	37.6699

fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasinesscorsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	183.9870
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it	222.1098
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst dartagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully	309.4001
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended	116.4402
dartagnan uttered a slight cry of joy this woman or rather this apparitionfor the carriage passed with the rapidity of a visionwas mme	256.9917
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres	486.1183
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied ones self not in paris but in venice	113.2970
the bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges	114.6662
i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust	214.8843
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m	79.5640
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him	45.8490
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses peste said porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin	67.7423
then you hope said davrigny with surprise	51.8716
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent when he is absent i am there but when you leave him for instance oh when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majestys special guard	83.7257
if you like replied the latter	97.1830
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you ah yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon	47.2382
let us draw lots let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief	92.5603
see look at fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	166.8845
villefort walked to and fro behind them	36.6980
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand yes said dartagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you cant think that dartagnan dartagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	93.4409
not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering	118.3045
as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him	62.6280
we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven we are the poor succored by god but why not address yourself to your sister the queen asked the girl	134.0020
but is he really a prince i will not answer for it said monte cristo	28.6574
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance	128.6628
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance	154.0421
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop	131.5623
touches upon the strange effects a halfpistole may have	61.4764
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	173.9849
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a magdalen by correggiowas raised and turned towards him	138.5956
i will not continued he after a moments silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale	216.9072
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step	73.3478
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly	91.0138
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone	119.6806
my good dame asked dartagnan can you tell me what has become of one of my friends whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago a handsome young man three or fourandtwenty years old mild amiable and well made that is hewounded in the shoulder just so	91.0023
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight	94.7237
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain	128.1045
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house	74.4205
yet you have unquestionably some ambition i have sir and what may it be i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listeni have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists	120.3793
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession to whom tell m	223.4492
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	77.5568
he is at constantinople among the turks exclaimed raoul alarmed	499.8327
no replied dartagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people cannot see whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion chastised monsieur said dartagnan the expression is strong it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face ah _pardieu_ i know full well that you dont turn your back to yours and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly	127.8213
goodday penelon returned morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain the captain m	60.4430
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel	91.5546
yes replied albert raising his voice	31.2820
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki	61.1242
powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saintnicolas the city hall designed by puget the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebière	191.4147
_hola_ lubin my pistols planchet called out dartagnan take care of the lackey i will manage the master planchet emboldened by the first exploit sprang upon lubin and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his breast	100.8773
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him	167.2864
dartagnans intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him	117.3319
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage	866.7668
besides mother remark how vivid his eye how ravenblack his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkleshe is not only vigorous but also young the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts	187.0150
like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evenings diversion he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day	105.2982
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it	76.4551
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened what	91.1992
ah really this is magnificent but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear maximilianthey understand i mean because he wants petting	207.7119
do you think he would recollect you my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me well go and talk with the boy said dartagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible while dartagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts	107.2435
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen	66.0758
i ask for it without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm	71.9920
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty	102.9114
well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queens manner	64.2303
milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart	97.5606
what is life to mevery little without you mother for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name	100.4822
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	94.9020
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m	14.5183
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks	322.2983
i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion	114.5120
m the epistle is laconic said dartagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter	53.0700
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children	53.3136
alas monsieur said she that is too bad what the devil do you see so bad in it said dartagnan	50.2520
she should have wanted nothing have you ever seen the queen of england inquired dartagnan	81.5027
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself what signal the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose	171.4768
soon he saw the lights of la consigne	2472.7307
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	113.3171
revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the kings authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed	102.3370
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	378.6772
ugh i am tired cried dartagnan sitting down	21.4802
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar	104.0571
have you any money dartagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket	65.2899
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	241.3524
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting	107.5354
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind	180.5469
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor	422.4179
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment dartagnan whistled a little air of incredulity	267.9110
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his masters bed the chimeras of planchet faded away	167.4244
in fact the rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before	129.2426
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sicklylooking	636.7700
oh oh replied dartagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen	58.9694
de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion	409.0262
morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons	147.9909
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine	157.0699
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed	60.2849
aramis smiled as one who hopes	63609.4492
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escapeinaction is a pardonable offence i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal	120.0582
the arts change about and make a tour of the world things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow themthat is all but there is always the same result	137.8169
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky	165.8977
morrel i hearyou insinuating dog you m	64.5453
besides they felt that the _dénouement_ of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make	212.9380
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	146.1452
one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the _soubrette_ under the gateway of the hôtel but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed she took him gently by the hand	81.0277
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply i am a priest said the young man	13.5211
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory when do you leave immediately the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you	149.1127
dartagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself	111.5120
this mystery required an explanation at least so dartagnan declared to himself	96.7486
by the light of one of these torches dartagnan perceived men in uniform	145.7956
what is the king doing they asked	162.0661
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentlemans side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	104.5091
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself	67.2942
the _cicerone_ reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman	28.7632
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it you ought to be satisfied if your majesty is so said tréville we are oh yes i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of dartagnan	56.6507
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	296.1491
is there any difficulty in the way no replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn the deuce that puts a different face on the matter	122.0315
good heavens how can you tell me that does that alarm you cried dartagnan	30.3647
we cannot say how long the night seemed to milady but dartagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness	155.8255
it was mousqueton who was obeying his masters command	510.8882
richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money	63.3592
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing nothingthe chest was no longer there m the chest no longer there murmured madame danglars choking with fear	259.1967
i saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count he eats then yes but so little it can hardly be called eating he must be a vampire laugh if you will the countess g who knew lord ruthven declared that the count was a vampire ah capital said beauchamp	117.1559
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might	308.9894
still though not actually received at the hôtel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess	150.3578
but doctor you see me already so grievedhow can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow	364.6224
how very astonishing cried he at length	67.8119
well i too could keep a servant i too could have a tilbury i too could dine where i like but why do i not	155.1321
bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag the cardinals cried dartagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife	147.1738
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity	90.3501
i have taught you how to handle a sword you have thews of iron a wrist of steel	346.6861
le baron franz dépinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders	17.9582
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like dartagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light dartagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville	120.1502
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve	129.9522
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay	80.1808
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father	111.0983
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty	122.7952
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès	71.2722
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition your arms my lordwhat arms zounds my weapons what weapons my military weapons yes my lord at any rate i think so make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	236.9672
at ten oclock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the kings guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel	144.9195
what time do you breakfast albert at halfpast ten precisely asked debray taking out his watch	76.7153
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an _auberge_ recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man	121.8873
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there yes youre right replied the companion	137.0772
the fact was that emerys son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed	93.7668
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family	91.0877
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	62.9743
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat	2264.1929
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing	85.1131
while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could m dear valentine well would you believe it	102.5548
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man	13.9859
oh yes was the ready answer	4921.3916
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil	59.5322
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped	33.4574
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them the queen spoke with some impatience	110.9745
tell me _pardieu_ it was the most simple thing in the world	53.0862
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance	118.3935
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed	246.7914
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto	229.3104
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus	83.4414
on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well	171.4798
as soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck	84.8063
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head	88.6486
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one i	58.8881
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know it how do i know it said dartagnan	35.8701
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	72.7375
the miserable villain he had foreseen all	125.9039
have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred piastres the count went to his _secrétaire_ opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz	99.9614
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment	81.3819
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin	145.2101
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	440.7308
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend	96.3516
i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days	107.6445
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech	115.8054
no no monsieur said monte cristo	1.0006
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	160.3094
they were perhaps in league with him oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m	46.5330
the news of the arrival of the _pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window	126.3085
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chaseloving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerfs remark	204.0936
well said the count you do not get out m	35.6266
well then let it be war have we not on our side the conqueror of rocroy of nordlingen of lens the prince bowed low	180.6228
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him	76.6679
i feel my head a little confused i will take a turn in the garden go and where shall i find you here in an hour here in an hour	62.3844
i am a friend captain groslow cried mordaunt	192.5079
my dear landlady said dartagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service my brother wish your sister goodmorning master peter wilkom suster said planchet	96.5487
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her	123.9118
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up	117.3669
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read alberts letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it	132.2543
i can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us my son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes	98.2606
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle	308.0260

he had friends then after five years in prison	52.2067
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewelbox so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left	123.4082
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me	29.3489
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek one is i believe from phædrus and the other from bias	638.1287
the iron box was thereno one had touched itunder a beautiful figtree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot	326.7253
i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed	62.0721
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	68.4586
dépinay arrives in paris m my dear grandmother interrupted valentine consider decorumthe recent death	812.0222
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word	84.9332
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you	158.0631
the procurators wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation	180.6451
your very grateful milady clarik thats all very simple said dartagnan i expected this letter	72.5453
let us strive i beseech youlet us strive to be cheerful yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind	89.4155
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed	72.3800
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively	97.4718
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	152.0321
a gentleman laughed in my face	192.8310
de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background bah you are wrong	78.1429
father cried maximilian how could you say the _pharaon_ was lost	39.5889
de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse	182.2538
what the devil did you come to such a country for athos	64.4179
the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty	73.8686
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsdaume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusements sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project	217.1579
on these days he spoke a little	71.8732
dartagnan believed this cough to be a signal	50.3580
he should have been nothing said the king nothing	44.2542
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination	159.5820
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed	142.3849
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door	70.1658
she lived in the place royalethen the fashionable quarterat number and he undertook to call and take dartagnan with him in order to introduce him	168.9942
the two musketeers met at the gate	22.4504
de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senseshe wanted air	135.6950
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefortone of the lowliest of the low then mazarin is still mazarin the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen married if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover you surprise me	156.1125
you surprise me exclaimed the monarch	23806.8867
well said andreamy servants coat and my hat ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do you	57.3784
porthos paid his compliments to m	109.7913
sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes	121.8822
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given	210.9336
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her handas i now do at your entreaty	232.5619
not at all said châteaurenaud slowly i think he is violently agitated	197.0374
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	316.4166
the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations	114.1508
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian	130.1365
thank god my child was not then dead no it was not dead and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy	76.8601
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters	272.1370
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road the devil he does money and a large sum said mazarin	95.9994
do you know what he has done this child	105.7967
well now my dear gérard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted but i so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me but my dear fellow replied m	55.6383
he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later louis xiv	84.4023
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her	744.2831
did i tell you that i wouldnt serve any other	169.1980
franz fell powerless on a chair villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man	61.4440
ah there theres something promising said dartagnan	14.5050
de villefort what cried monte cristo it was m	14.9609
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow	30.8683
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	61.9142
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillardyou know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head	153.9239
i say that he is illinformed	25724488.0000
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent	223.0173
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke	108.5693
the servant went out but returned almost immediately	909.1894
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them	90.6924
today look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen it is enough said athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame i thank you gentlemen	64.7259
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians dartagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans	551.5025
do you say resumed dartagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman i tell you i am sure of it continued the host	45.6032
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button then i must give up the idea no we have them readymade	123.1983
one momenti begfor here are the chevalier dherblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eyewitnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister	85.1306
it is well sir replied villefort from belowit is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side	97.9214
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the cross	42.1489
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title	61.2103
then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword	187.5437
you have a calm strong mind maximilian	796.8777
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur	29.2146
i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations	351.5617
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home	124.4392
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silvermounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshals baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemys line of battle at fribourg	168.3458
i shall be about again in a few days why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris	50.8082
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination	130.0839
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness	68.0533
we were but the instruments that is all but as to free will aramis how acts the judge	137.7420
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos	71.9293
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged	200.4118
where am i he asked himself	1003.1221
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son	95.0623
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do	51.4611
ah said porthos let us hear what he says dartagnan opened the letter and read as follows dear dartagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me	69.1825
dartagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_ which he improvised	233.3216
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning	57.6732
but what happened after my departure how can i tell said kitty	134.7722
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer	111.9118
i would have saved madame de saintméran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living	78.0251
be civil or i shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to ones rank you dont choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned dartagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name enough enough what is your name i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat	84.9789
ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury for their ears closely applied to the door did not lose a syllable of what he said while their mouths repeated as he went on the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber	91.3416
lend me your backbut dont let the cardinal go porthos lent him his back and dartagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself	56.4078
well you are right it is more difficult than i thought	23.8374
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m	179.4848
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	73.6298
milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years	97.6229
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos	88.5722
cardinal i must have the queens papers but how to take them sire	155.1557
i have not yet had time to see him again	54.5644
anne of austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her	166.5006
you do not know your own good fortune and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing	49.0153
well everything was finished as you know	21.9076
mouston appeared with a most piteous face	7141.8550
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible	183.0884
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried dartagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement	78.5985
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information	230.7085
i have then about fifty pistoles	12.1574
now we are alone dear aramis said dartagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchets horse ifaith answered aramis as you see from heaven from heaven replied dartagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which dartagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same here then is a puzzle for the learned observed dartagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near	98.2631
be tranquil murmured milady i will avenge youand cruelly _peste_ said dartagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come it took some time for dartagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished	184.4318
he pardoned and having pardoned he remained	143.8295
he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen	152.7493
i am just setting out for blois	193.9770
take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris you are going to make a patriarch of him m oh no said morrel my sister is fiveandtwenty my brotherinlaw is thirty they are gay young and happy	114.9898
are you there now _certes_ replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle the _fingers_ resumed the jesuit st peter blessed with the _fingers_	254.1968
but in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship	266.7661
morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way in a moment sir answered dantès and im with you then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the porthole	126.4972
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment why so	38.7342
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m	35.6253
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	261.5829
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here an enemy cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin	88.2105
yes said monte cristo you were a major that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said monte cristo	84.9906
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense	117.7312
why it is as good as a century at what hour does the examination take place at two oclock send at twelve said danglars smiling	122.9956
so much the better young man so much the better dont try to understand ityou will only lose your time you forgive me then sir said raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian certainly one of the most charming persons that livesmademoiselle frances daubigne does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa the friend of henry iv his granddaughter	126.4483
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly	74.5130
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable _puros_	102.2940
henceforth we have nothing to fear	174.0147
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemys entire army	122.5990
these three windows were in madame de saintmérans room	60.8160
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude	4345.6440
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one	262.1820
baron send for the minister of war	34.8590
well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the ladys agitation revealed tell me what is the matter oh lucien can i confide in you of course you know you can do so	90.9835
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed	213.2125
do you know saintmandrier i do in the hour of rest between noon and one oclock galleyslaves having a nap after dinner we may well pity the poor fellows said the abbé	126.6620
a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht	140.0269
after the popes death and his sons exile it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinals time but this was not the case	102.4994
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him	93.6459
you are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircasemust not one speak of that a little my lord diavolo cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands i am a lost and ruined man but without listening to his protestations of alarm dartagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall	141.2341
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling	9.2027
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	180.1422
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth	45.8204
take it then and pray disturb us no longer said madame de villefort giving the album to edward who then went towards the door led by his mother	59.0605
look dartagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of bradshaws gaze she has not turned pale it is lady fairfax herself said dartagnan	190.7207
goodnight and before dantès could open his mouthbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoners mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	124.9687
you ask what god is doing	876.7653
you are mistakeni am not the count of monte cristo then who are you m i am he whom you sold and dishonoredi am he whose betrothed you prostitutedi am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortunei am he whose father you condemned to die of hungeri am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiveni am edmond dantès danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate	218.4017
we will grow old together and talk of our companions no replied dartagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin i wish to be there i expect to get something by it what do you expect to get why i expect to be made marechal of france ha ha cried porthos who was not completely taken in by dartagnans gasconades	81.6060
de tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the louvre but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of st germain	52.5568
you ask that put your two hands together	405.0574
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered dartagnan	24.4318
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me m mercédès burst into tears her womans heart was breaking under its load of memories	124.1278
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy	5647.5659
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look	105.4929
the worthy shipowner knew from penelons recital of the captains brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him	143.7378
the storm broke about ten oclock	1.2593
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the kings procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m	85.9659
andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty	237.5720
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake	85.7203
de saintméran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count	6.4463
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak	303.6740
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him	44.6410
why to accuse the man do you address the woman do i know m	83.5530
i fancy i hear horses feet impossible returned dartagnan	280.9487
i shall buy a chestnutcolored suit	4448.4902
well one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant art thou sure said the man in the cloak	101.4767
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries	219.3236
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman but the kingwhere is the king exclaimed athos anxiously	144.7397
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude	145.5319
what is this light asked he	18.8699
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so	26.6411
can he be inconstant before being happy oh no he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart	45.5029
i should injure the queen instead of serving her well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusala distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen rochefort smiled contemptuously	200.3214
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself	128.0711
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith theres enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris	204.7112
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed	55.8911
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns	96.1235
i am at home to nobody said milady observe to _nobody_ the servant went out	235.5797
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room	43.6060
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters hand	98.0728
the man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey	139.6860
the petition finished villefort read it aloud	109.9003
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twentyfour hours dartagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility	87.8414
dessessarts valet came to dartagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres	66.9875
oh heavens exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myselfthat young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf yes said monte cristo i recognized him how soyou were looking the other way m the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street	61.6093
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature dantès pressed the gendarmes hand as though he would crush it	80.9183
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day	429.5372
de la trémouilles testimony and himself	213.6620
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen	120.4120
the counts tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere	135.7201
cavalcanti had done half an hour before	13.0901
pass on your way then it is the best thing to do this raillery exasperated jussac	136.1278

dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him	192.3004

during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape	49.5749

bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low	104.1609
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy	195.0073
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	130.7735

let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to london and back	59.6465

he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover	18062.0098
are you on the ground asked dartagnan	150.0255
we are about to ascertain sire replied dartagnan as he rapidly left the room	90.2694
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart	30.6924
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort	72.8309
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	201.5028
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle	116.2491
dartagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend i dont like people to quiz me sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please dartagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital	105.5589

de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult	77.6838
when i informed him that your lordship was the _protégé_ of monsieur de tréville and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman he appeared to be very much disturbed and asked me where that letter was and immediately came down into the kitchen where he knew your doublet was then thats my thief replied dartagnan	80.8476
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript	114.8429
then the ironhearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept	81.5036
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet	92.2253

he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness	91.8953
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hairthose three marks of race	648.0906

i did not lose sight of him for an instant	18.2258

i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	65.8552
that was what he could not know	24.7992
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me murder screamed patrick	249.4963

lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him	106.1624
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry	28.6688
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups	351.4191
stop gentlemen said albert i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo in private asked morrel	45.8705
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near	30.9710
are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth	122.7018
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them why yes i think soin the street said athos and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise	66.5856
i see spots of blood on the ground and he set off to follow the two friends	25.6831
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer distance	312.4458
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity	1312.8961
you have some in the house have you not yes send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic villefort immediately despatched a messenger	444.7850
forward blaisois a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank	68.4179

he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge	95.1443
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs	72.0223
i say why is the king taken prisoner	326.5364
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed and porthos and aramis i could not find them they did not come but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them yes monsieur well dont budge then if they come tell them what has happened	85.7442
but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir	384.9508

de saintméran madame de saintméran m	183.2632
during the night between the th and th of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three oclock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation	89.8250
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request	43.2598
dartagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer	317.0932

since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman i presume that she has returned to tours to tours	80.8345
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of dartagnan and porthos	55.9837
de trévillea thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer had very much astonished his captain	109.3651
they descended into the plain by the ladder	65.5631
châteaurenaud and morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder	321.4287
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them	80.0882
are you not a christian he said falling on his knees	46.2587
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises	173.8016
i have been wrong i see it	33.7238
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual	133.2789
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	831.5575
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	73.8971
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison	68.6550
there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move	94.0047
the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door	50.8380
by mordaunt yes but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us	137.9229
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do	119.5765

those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night	167.0947
you have been here a very long time john said he	253.9137
he preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	115.3198
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every yearthe carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter	234.7326
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father his father yes his father replied the abbé his right name was noirtier de villefort at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before	85.8204
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saintantoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porters absence	132.1054
morrel called her and she ran to the gate	33.1697
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty	706.0673

you do not believe me m	226.4937
i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners	58.5506
gracious heavens exclaimed dantès what is the matter	6.1905
those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no grudge is your honor sure i can answer for it they do not well we wont speak of it any more then and planchet took his place in dartagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed	135.8979
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone	254.6399
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word	28.7785
well here we are at last said one of them	67.8291
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	40.1038
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly	139.5382

the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short	175.5560
my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish	93.0629
the night was rapidly approaching and already at the cry of _moccoletti_ repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd	154.0742

go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon	18.8926
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarins mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned dartagnan	175.2214
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply	84.5325
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right yes said caderousse	135.7467
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me m the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dantès	150.1317
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists if he persists said the cardinal	68.6239

as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table	127.4767
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried	2667.5330
i have not said goodmorning to you monsieur dartagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you	45.9329
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m	77.4041

bonacieux his name age condition and abode	119.0604
enter gentlemen said laporte since the queen desires you so to do then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe	71.7562
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything	141.9567
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood	123.2739
this lad for he was scarcely a mansimple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked goodextended his affection even to his judge spite of villeforts severe look and stern accent	336.9668
you also exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my earsassassinated i have assassinated then and not executed i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan	121.0604
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on	96.2517
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom	91.8472
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it	213.7916
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all	45.1211
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you our young friend will be extremely well received madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos	57.9990
he not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or not	143.4782
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner	84.6139
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate	100.4637
why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the _si_ as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal	212.4608
the pope and cæsar borgia first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and cæsar spada one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope	158.0633

we shall not interfere with each otheryour object is a title mine money	1085.3076

then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore	64.3691
danglars by heaven cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir to caderousses great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the counts breast flew back blunted	203.8611

father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window	82.8677
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then the devil said porthos what can we say to mazarin leave that to mei have my plan	89.1511
indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates me oh dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	107.4267
he sighed and set to work again	164.8394
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them	95.6677
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation	183.2966
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safeconduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feareddartagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreusehe may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away the devil whats to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you cannot take me with you no the order is imperative	104.7549
have no society no neighbors our companions will be ridinghorses dogs to hunt with and a fishingboat exactly what i wish for i will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you but shall you be allowed to go into normandy i may go where i please yes i am aware you may go alone since i once met you in italybut to accompany the mysterious monte cristo you forget count that i have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you woman is fickle said francis i woman is like a wave of the sea said shakespeare both the great king and the great poet ought to have known womans nature well womans yes my mother is not woman but _a_ woman as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language what i mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes ah yes indeed said monte cristo with a sigh and do you think she is in the least interested in me i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else and does she try to make you dislike me on the contrary she often says morcerf i believe the count has a noble nature try to gain his esteem indeed said monte cristo sighing	96.4137
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moments tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom	142.3911
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii	63.4655
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew	117.3899
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant	66.9815
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him	64.6532
the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us	156.4007
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawingroom with her little edward	70.7336
the duchess was the first to speak	79.3205
mademoiselle darmilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the _tableaux vivants_ of which the germans are so fond	405.8750
but although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	360.4843
violence he said to himself would spoil all dartagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt	94.8509
for life replied porthos in the same manner	15.9254
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall and why parry do not look i implore you my king but what is the matter	46.6465
what took place at portsmouth august chapter lx	619.7987
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully	387.6266
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear	1033.4644
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where dartagnan was confined	92.4288
you spent it as you pleased that was your business	99.8371
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me then today madame oh today i am no further than gratitude ah you are too charming said dartagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love no i use your generosity thats all	87.5594
i have not a penny about me you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms which that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket hold your tongue imprudent man do you wish to destroy me you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since a single word makes you tremble and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined	86.4747
at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed	14055.8994
de châteaurenaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride	109.4940
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert	1851.6207
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him	61.9073
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment	53.3363
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers	158.3752
de monte cristo the count bowed	177.0385
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it	13.8140
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	150.8665

and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes yes so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir yes there was a profound silence	95.3058
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him	153.3339
to own the truth i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes a droll way of showing your affliction the duke meant to say affection but my lord returned la ramee what would you do if you got out	123.3732
danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod	290.8608
fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference	89.5388
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise	124.0572
a galleyslave escaped from confinement at toulon and what crime has he committed he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him	44.0356
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nutshell	337.8001

drink this and then take nothing more tonight valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear	104.5696
it was now athoss turn to take a sly look	444.6168
she drew her husband to the door	8.6795
and he is dead yes well sir said darminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted	155.1371
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal m i understandyou allowed matters to take their course that was all yes sir answered caderousse and remorse preys on me night and day	147.9037
de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which dartagnan had left him a little cavalier	59.7412
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve oclock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _pharaon_ and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion	136.9383
noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	212.8546

we are betrayed said the king in a low voice	12.4639
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre at one oclock this morning she had not returned my god what can have become of her then we shall know be assured	95.0057
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked	86.2707
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition and villeforts father extended his hand to the bellrope to summon the servant whom his son had not called	145.3969
i held the horses my hands were full your honor a shot was fired that moment mousqueton shrieked with pain	409.5771
in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads albert had often heardnot from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangersthe description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him	126.0047
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bedcurtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine	133.3427
what does it signify to you if i am murdered	30.4835

porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great ladyfor she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	110.9651
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me	409.9855

these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly	426.0488
de boville receivergeneral of the charities _ma foi_ said monte cristo i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out	88.1499

peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea	130.6540
you have done right lieutenant said the soldier	59.4981
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	25.5078
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes	38.4595
repeat it repeat it cried dartagnan it will make a little change not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse the devil said dartagnan	100.5569
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking dartagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him	63.4526
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	128.3947
did parliament pass this act athos asked of him in english	140.0691
once in paris i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman well you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis	122.1609

but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate	143.1438

whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazins house	121.3554
ah said beauchamp you doubt me	37.2539
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me dartagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl	82.7906
for my part monsieur i am catholicmy father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a huguenot and what was the end of this worthy man asked dartagnan	132.6268
they were rapidly leaving the château dif behind	44.3872
he wished to have the young man at handnot that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen	112.4007
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age	109.6470

it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late the gale had given way	268.2361
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand	56.4767
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one	59.4432
_holà_ mousqueton seats and order double the bottles do you know what we are eating here said athos at the end of ten minutes	34.1601
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea	58.6437
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count bad replied athos very bad but you received it with enthusiasm as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear dherblay	80.4234
but with the rapidity of thought dartagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed	207.0204
dartagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses	100.4238
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned	396.4711
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket	89.6900
i try to be beloved not feared well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says like master like servant pray what does that mean it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them he the point aimed at by every poniard richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends	169.7714

yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings milady sprang out of bed	95.1631
but pardon me are you free	3994.4824
his father and mother were catholics i believe his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter and what name does he now bear mordaunt a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france do you say as a monk it was thus and by mere accidentmay god pardon me if i blasphemethat he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune then i understand it all he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled	108.6234
never mind be content i will do my best	31.5155
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean he went to find aramis	130.2570
morrel he said who was he the owner of the _pharaon_ and patron of dantès and what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abbé	107.0560
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy	158.4253
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which dartagnans letter had given birth in the mind of her brotherinlaw and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood	117.5787
at the names comte de la fere and chevalier dherblay charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene	51.8804
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis thats all i can say how monsieur cried bazin a poem sell so dear as that it is incredible oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade	82.9979
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray	124.5140
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in	113.9623
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young ladys illness yes said the old man	121.4258
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me	86.0300
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead	450.5347
porthos was seduced by a winecolored doublet and seagreen breeches	10986.3936
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur dartagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen	50.4895
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned	78.0311
you have seen your dream realized i can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor benedetto is richhe has an annuity well you have an annuity i have m yes since i bring you your two hundred francs caderousse shrugged his shoulders	133.9931
at that moment he cut it	20.3614
they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the kings musketeersone of whom was woundedand a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinals guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory yes sire as complete as that of the bridge of ce four men one of them wounded and a youth say you one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself dartagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest friendsthe son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well	125.2817
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again	144.3448
i recognize you perfectly the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion	167.4698
what you dont know me no monseigneur well two words will refresh your memory	236.1313
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss	236.5842
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere	32.8735
grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes	33.1982
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion	101.2261
no my lord and i will set out at once	32.8813
dartagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey	137.5575
de villeforts in connection with his attachment for valentine	1105.8398
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world you live alone then i do you have no sisterno sonno father i have no one how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life it is not my fault madame	118.7403
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man	197.1015
milady looked at this man and hesitated	169.1357
that is the crime of which i accuse her that is the cause for which she was branded monsieur dartagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman the punishment of death replied dartagnan	67.6331
yes but he couldnt understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her and what said the abbé asked athos	80.6354
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me	210.8647
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite ordination cried dartagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him	103.0441
and what else does your worship wish for to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom the viscount de bragelonne	70.2642
well now listen we are listening it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him	143.7503
several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto	304.0562
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high	56.1174
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers	60.8363
in the chamber of dartagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	120.9118
bravo youve killed him i think no wounded his horse only what would you have my dear fellow	85.4943
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage	86.0909
do you know the assassin asked morrel	73.9248
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down	499.2103
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in mens clothes	279.6318
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed	117.6224
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps	68.7793
m you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse	362.2705
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood	148.7436
the comte de la fere cannot be far off only the doors are locked that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for gods sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve	127.1976
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives	497.8736
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four men alighted franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his fathers death which had hitherto been a mystery	109.6543
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty	114.8766
de villefort the object of unusual attention and we had almost said of general admiration sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him	93.9943
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound	150.2055
but you my friendare you not going to change your dress no i shall go as i am	38.1913
i will bless youi i am dying cried mordaunt come to me come to me dartagnan began to be touched	56.0350
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you cant refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea	192.0356
i will even venture to say that i am certain m	25.7370
de villeforts door and the coffin removed into it from the postwagon	653.4276
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant	118.1027
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein	449.1608
but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	76.4017
days and weeks passed away then monthsdantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight	240.5773
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking	127.6411
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged	137.1245
de villefort saw it open before him	71.0825
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money the host became as pale as death for dartagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master	104.3873
madame de saintméran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former	161.8353
you will see the same at every opening from this palace to which i should lead you	93.1746
instantly a mask wearing the wellknown costume of a peasant woman snatched his _moccoletto_ from him without his offering any resistance	178.7879
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished	172.2104
what must be done then asked the generali have my carriage here said the president	131.8816
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure	41.8606
yes the rolling of a carriage it is the one my brother sends for us oh my god come come courage the bell of the convent gate was sounded milady was not mistaken	76.2764
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air	98.9416
m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going	77.8367
in their stead dartagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall	135.3151
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag	176.2363
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man	57.7167
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do	54.4982
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur	346.1641
in half an hour the young man bowed	39.0068
come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hungerthat is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone	83.5198
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue you are stupid replied the cardinal	83.8625
it is kept by a friend of ours at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the peacock yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost brokenwinded aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	131.3958
all this will not advance your outfit said athos for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you	65.9486
i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead	56.9993
do you keep a journal no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself do you talk in your sleep m i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baronesss face and villefort turned awfully pale	101.6800
keep your illhumor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it	117.8994
remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived	91.4861
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de trévilles letter and you will show your leaves of absence	77.0691
did you really think me capable of that at least said the abbé i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been	67.9046
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes	192.0397
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion	135.6479
three days afterward pistache was found deadpoisoned	18203.4980
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul morrel smiled sadly	141.1849
you think then as i do that she deceives me said the king	36.7637
immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep	64.1570
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress	90.8122
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness	233.6976
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter	234.0438
two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal	340.6826
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner	84.8463
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure	49.2900
franz dépinay said the count is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron dépinay by charles x the same said villefort	121.9205
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountaintheories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m	163.2859
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly	658.6309
this horrible place contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantèshe was now number	149.3006
you are setting up an establishment of course why yes replied the count	51.4255
where am i and why am i here	75.2300
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry	118.2783
we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it	271.2265
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me cried valentine	75.4550
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you	24.3213
as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty	82.0272
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france	62.3636
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model	173.0806
should you like to be rich and your own master _parbleu_ said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question take the postchaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pontdebeauvoisin	143.1887
what then well he is a man porthos looked at dartagnan in astonishment	48.1445
m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention	104.6967
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber	92.9977
no listen to me i have the true idea let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young musketeer	98.9917
as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day	92.1107
her very self she gave it me last night	131.6449
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly	58.7824
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day	110.5611

now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more	77.3849
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the counts manner	62.7931
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice	52.7664
he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation	255.2006

france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiersall proved the great richelieu no longer in existence	885.0499
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder	166.0653
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	167.3970
if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain his pardon	68.8490

then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope	219.4598
god has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	70.1607
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame	41.0388
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire	80.0184
this windingsheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before	45.5386
de tréville in the same tone that a party of _procureurs_ commissaries and men of the policevery estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniformhave taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort levêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos athos said the king mechanically yes certainly i know that name let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously	148.6916

oh were i not a foreigner were i but a frenchman were i but of gentle birth the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties	159.1287
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinxlike smile	82.8500
no well then you shall see it now in a second dartagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked him	190.4193

but it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion yes thats probable said dartagnan	90.4620
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself	121.4269
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his illhumor	47.9973
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissaryfor he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	184.1398
cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent the major looked anxiously around him	75.0359
davrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances	290.8790
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	128.7024
still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his enemies	98.3350
de villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward	198.6339
do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall	55.5985

yes cut the cable then athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord	89.7792

no he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see younothing more	167.8759
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	111.5487
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune dartagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them	109.5818
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted	48.7171
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will	101.7318
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features	92.8296
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said	53.8846
i should not have guessed it	30.6270
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your _affettatore_ who is mine also he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you you will lose the preference and that will be your fault do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied and now we understand each other when do you wish the carriage to be here in an hour in an hour it will be at the door an hour after the vehicle was at the door it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival	79.2091
it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression	36.5927
the bars were filled with drinkers	176800.1250
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did why so inquired dantès	244.3531
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried châteaurenaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism	145.5271
franz dépinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfishyou have already said soand as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself	121.5543
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered	115.1874
that comforts me a little has he wit or notthis demon dartagnan said porthos astonished at his friends deception	297.1165

from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	84.0985
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know dartagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul	124.1395
on entering the room noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room	69.5511

debray inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and goodnature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the bankers domestic life	93.5019
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest	86.7367
franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly	64.9032
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondys coachman	106.6096

no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes	99.0601
dartagnan already wore his uniformfor being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit	123.8182

de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil certainly for he told me what is it sir to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo	145.8913
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with dartagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimauds laconic reply	251.6647
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door	38.9760
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	356.2675
the man who lives to see shall see and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court	103.6633

the soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along	134.5948
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded	185.0255
do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like glass that will not prevent me replied dartagnan if ever i find him in the meantime said tréville seek him notif i have a right to advise you all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion	75.8969
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saintmartin and to be going towards the madeleine	83.8203
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii	105.1088
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked dartagnan	410.5638
the name of one of the four friends is caderousse the innkeeper shivered	272.5446
dartagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurators wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped	74.2565
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots	136.5349
adieu madame replied the kings attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door	73.6169
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow	119.2189
thank you countthank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation yes everyone in my family is well so much the better yet you have something to tell me replied the count with increased anxiety	59.3364
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table	169.2749
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel acknowledge that if albert is brave he cannot be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation	92.9125
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jackinthebox	251.0193
he had stanched the wound and the man was better	16.5271
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brotherinlaw she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered buckingham cried the monk	84.3332
ten minutes elapsed during which dartagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second	86.8552
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of francs per annum paid quarterly	203.4096
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege	388.9588
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this doubtless doubtless athos	84.7700
just so then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent	67.8887
the latter faithful to the principle of horace _nil admirari_ had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught	598.9238
but grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses	162.3155
you will be a brave and adventurous captain dartagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp	125.8172
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès you have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs i said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i cant keep on my legs	92.1567
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase	63.1424
the time and place are but illsuited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious	309.1105
come sir said comminges make haste you must obey the king sir said broussel i am in bad health and cannot give myself up a prisoner in this state i must have time it is impossible said comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant impossible said louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the room	89.4424

in what can i have offended heri who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave	193.3534
come athos and aramis go to the right porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach paris he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route	201.7993
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste	254.8352
you killed that woman alas i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you	80.6190
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rosetrees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season	139.3913
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort	95.7376
what has happened quick quick returned the abbé listen to what i have to say dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end	113.1088
and now said dartagnan to the governors but you are wounded it seems said planchet	82.9865
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended	86.2308
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice	162.0427
davrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemists to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughters room	190.9514
you perceive then that he is not happy said the count	20.4748
island of monte cristo all i poss	54717.6523
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m	81.0284
you were always a merry companion my dear dartagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you	118.4329
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majestys wishes charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king	164.8680
in a moment he was on the ground	29.5959
she lives she is in safety in a convent she is at béthune where is béthune athos why upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders	210.5425
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness	63.3323
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings	198.4568
what our enemies say of us is then true	140.2333
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro	92.1506
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself monsieur dartagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an _obolus_ for your life i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence	68.2086
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul	102.8353
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument	300.1164
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriagewindow the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo	144.5646
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest	97.5364
the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality	174.7323
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures	93.5362
danglars and tell him that my mother and myself must leave paris tomorrow	126.0817
i began to fear that he would not come	11.7198
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah	332.3945
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword	75.2632
germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit	48.4918
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with halfstifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle	343.6320
move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded	316.5124
and sincei do not give it said the musketeer	35.5155
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again	57.7068
athos cried dartagnan wringing his hands	1.1719
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse	80.6773
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	263.6808
what are you doing asked he	27.9912
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career	53.1077
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count	87.2856
he will arrange everything for me	13.4494
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand	119.2772
my sister is happily married her husband is only my brotherinlaw that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life	110.2543
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house	36.4310
give me some water and ether	357239.7500
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleons secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villeforts plot	365.0983
dartagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers	125.2695
oh yes it is she a voice of strange sweetness how do you know it the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid	71.2791
in the meantime dartagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette	19.6685
her ladiesthat is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sensehad just brought into her dressingroom the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped	156.4919
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slepta vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell but for dartagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were diaphanous	504.9817
isnt it so kitty i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i am meanwhile kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier far off or near said kitty i shall always love you where the devil will constancy niche itself next murmured athos	110.9033
why do you like that best because then i have no responsibility	359.1888
coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme	112.6228
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment	99.2585
and my only heir are you not said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady	23.8543
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose	296.7317
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them	79.0469
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor	487.1443
beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young mans paroxysm of grief approached him	162.3617
bonacieux was going that was to follow her	52.9621
it was as we have said the st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness	82.9656
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel	192.9464
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an illbred man	2241.7981
are you then pressed for this money yes for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow tomorrow	150.8705
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurators wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse	78.1472
you are joking holloa patrick sign my lord never never help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	43.8767
fifty cavaliers cried the gascon and porthos	43.1872
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment	75.4408
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland	165.3988
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved	501.5283

but youis there nothing that you want we came here with the intention of asking for something to eat alas they have taken everything there isnt a morsel of bread in the house you hear dartagnan said athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner it is all one to me now said dartagnan i am no longer hungry faith neither am i said porthos	79.2144
i cannot now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest	90.2312
if we stay here five minutes more theres an end of us yes you are right but where shall we go asked porthos	51.4506
and towards whom do you bear this personal illfeeling then said morcerf turning pale with anger	241.4602
and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you nay perhaps you will even have a double reward i madame i cried felton	133.2610
edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly	274.8507
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	90.1886
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent	178.3663
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and wellstudied course oh yesyes i do sir it is the _pede claudo_ of the ancients	237.5479
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper tomorrow en teteatete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didnt see what that had to do with him	79.8699
athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him	21.6298
oh yes she cried i do love you i love you as one loves a father brother husband i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings m let it be then as you wish sweet angel god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies and has given me this reward he will not let me end my triumph in suffering i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me	109.4478
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly	76.0650
but he must be disturbed cried the host here are two english gentlemen just arrived well well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the best	160.0533
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion	67.8139
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent	259.1180
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	64.6109
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourselfwhom he considered the first three personages in france dartagnan added m	175.7154

what a life i cause you to lead poor maximilian you who are formed for happiness i bitterly reproach myself i assure you well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips	132.8383
tell him all about it baron why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king these were his own words of that i am certain well blacas what think you of this inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him	143.8338
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind	31.3011
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone	91.0082
what do you want something to drink your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow	146.3751
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror	182.3620
presently they heard milady retire to her room	28.2924
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table	42.6788
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes	51.0390
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself	210.2336
i do not know do you wish for anything i wish to see the governor the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber	30.8936
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm	136.5061
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage	158.5765
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat	122.0990
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	69.7482
it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès with the passage which united them	86.6002
the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption but at crèvecœur aramis declared he could proceed no farther	97.5798
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold wellwater the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage	113.2098

morrel and strong in the multiplicationtable which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him	222.8072
but consider dartagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her	97.1736
yes if you really wish it said dartagnan and even with great pleasure i confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite ah my poor friend said aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers	122.3814

he was nineteen when he entered the château dif he was thirtythree when he escaped	103.5441
this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now representedbroken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughtsbut such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle	147.2413
we were speaking of hanging ah you see how it is said athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh i was sure it was sothe hanging of people is my nightmare yes yes replied dartagnan	120.4768
all this is very extraordinary said châteaurenaud still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed	185.9729
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa that was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera	124.0307

morrel you are going to destroy yourself indeed count said morrel shuddering what has put this into your head i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands	84.8739
he took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the dice	187.5718
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk	106.2411
i will descend with my eyes shut have you confidence in me said felton	89.8474
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them	202.6585
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	153.3256
yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it	118.2996

in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house	106.3073
i dare say such a thing might be had very possibly and a pair of oxen as easily found as the cart then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed	136.9410
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis	76.7186
you did well to defend the honor of a woman and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal	66.5464
tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy	74.1310
julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you	23.2106
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour ah baron baron said albert you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac like you oh dont worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father willingly if you wish it but let it be done explicitly and positively	175.5750

it is useless then to attempt anything with him	159.9516
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy awakening	95.0551

milady does not know me i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos for shame said aramis	91.6923
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler	321.9494
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it	202.3629
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond	79.1954
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man	65.8109
or richelieufor two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleurdelis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence	236.3190
ill manage it somehow you will see but said dartagnan now i think of itwhat is to prevent our beginning tonight nothing at all said groslow	109.8077
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him	83.4115
i told you so athos said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	12.5579
athos and dartagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	609.6603
more dead than alive he looked around him	20.2628
the visitor was introduced into the drawingroom which was like all other furnished drawingrooms	186.2886
the kings musketeers and the cardinals guards dartagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris	98.6995
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam	392.9185
it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father mercédès his betrothed bride fernand danglars and myself	208.3649
dartagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop	104.7439
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence	153.2689
in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end	159.6519
or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her wrists	102.3204
i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water	120.4257
she asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head	116.2770
take your glass then and let us drink	38.1944
the hour of dinner soon arrived	165.7169
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m	66.5260
thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m	139.3127
never sire i entreat you to do so besides in what manner can i make advances first by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her what is that give a ball you know how much the queen loves dancing	88.8336
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it	181.7592
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph	512.2371
this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my life	124.5856
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man	52.4396
it is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars	308.3468
as for his suspicions once on _terra firma_ once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite	188.2756
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word	48.9913
that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the servantsyou understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government	494.4443
i shall not go why asked porthos	64.9870
the guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron	331.3763
patrick discreetly kept in the background	1958.0769
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated	448.7553
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready	63.0163
has she left armentières grimaud made a sign in the affirmative	10.9563
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on a chair	260.7073
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance	191.0674
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	23.4662
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him	47.0273
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event he attributed it i believe to a political cause i doubted from the first and now i think entirely as he does	93.9293
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no illwill to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two oclock	146.4398
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert	99.6423
yours is a noble nature he said here is your sword raoul bent his knee to the ground	48.0436
and with how many fingers does he bless	375.8380
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her	65.5032
then my lord then what asked mazarin	144.5416
things passed as on the night before	144.7222
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his lifethat of standing behind a gilded carriage	130.0786
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst dartagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis	119.9965
he thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to advance	72.2616
at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request	120.0188
project gutenberg ebooks may be modified and printed and given awayyou may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected by copyright law	107.7878
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message	101.5659
captivity the third day felton had fallen but there was still another step to be taken	61.5705
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart	203.8902
do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellowsufferer does not perish with him	103.7260
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dantès	272.3131
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the dukes arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust	140.2051
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me	208.9234
the host stood at the door	66.1703
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale	25.0011
i used to play almost every night in france and since your return to england i have not handled a card or dicebox i sincerely pity you said dartagnan with an air of profound compassion	160.3750
my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern	152.4152
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant	89.5655
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii and i will adhere to it these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness	95.9136
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago	94.8069
at length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained	23.1795
you will have to find the abbé busoni and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare	168.9683
and you did not tell him that you came from me no sir at ten oclock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter	60.2642
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation	297.2623
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers	139.9898
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite corrupt	196.0590
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still	130.1555
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a newborn puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton	137.7400
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear	115.2469
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips	45.6862
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots	198.2839
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	76.8898
i have devoted myself to industry i study the useful arts	3123.9456
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage	75.8722
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services	122.2074
swords then cried aramis swords let us not lose a moment the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game	105.1327
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers	145.9779
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess	93.5145
seeing dartagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes	50.5546
she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of athos	89.8489
heheis murmured grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his masters hand	48.9474
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painfula wound made by a woman the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself	184.6410
he was her grandfather on the mothers side	70.9430
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m	98.3607
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth dartagnans confidence stopped there	318.2699
in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass	418.1507
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv	81.2792
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket	71.6310
listen to me i want to be enlightened on a subject then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw be enlightened said athos phlegmatically	94.3178
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family	277.6041
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared	118.2376
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so porthos looked at dartagnan with an expression of profound admiration	42.9666
these are doubtless your family arms	1113.3896
a lover is never terrible he said	25.9479
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear	169.5949
what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation what a delicious abbé you would have made oh its only a temporary postponement replied aramis i shall be one someday	170.6509
then while passing he had cast a rapid investigating glance into the kitchen and he was obliged to confess to himself to the shame of the procurators wife and his own regret that he did not see that fire that animation that bustle which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living	118.3524
they left the chamber at the same time	12.2430
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man	29.5783
danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them i do not understand you baron said morcerf	103.4731
it concerns me much said dartagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since and since asked the swiss	118.8643
these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills	583.0137
the first moments of her captivity were terrible a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature	238.0901
didnt you hear fellow yes i heard why then didnt you reply because these horses are not to be sold was the reply	107.7011
noirtier watched her with evident anguish	3058.0938
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard	56.2383
a daughter of henry iv of that great that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his soninlaw sir nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french speak italian sir	183.9476
and besides he said going out of this chamber isnt all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor today than you were yesterday	85.3454
i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future	163.1451

as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders	114.2676
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow	73.4584
let us try not to jest if we can	237.1083
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion	50.3821
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honori think perhaps too oftenthat i am in haste great haste	386.1229
this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure	141.6074

they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting	96.2615
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude	353.3255

he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival	165.2554
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth here i await thee there was profound silence	110.8078
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friendsan undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive	227.8452
they opened it and found francs in bank scrip	3821.4910
