as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him	371.7010

ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of oneand now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that youah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar	313.3994

he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	182.2353
comminges went out with a soldiers passive obedience	12305.5381
it seems to me that it is neither your majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission how did they act with regard to the maréchale dancre cried the king in the highest state of choler first her closets were thoroughly searched and then she herself the maréchale dancre was no more than the maréchale dancre	261.9157
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st cloud opposite destréess pavilion	457.9954
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing	449.0800
you can sleep here yes do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you no i must sleep at beaucaire	199.6378
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier	169.5812
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	173.3308
i thought so madame stammered the young girl	14.3084
noirtiers room was opened like all the rest	126.9048
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	195.8199
the closet into which dartagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawingroom where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see	221.2347
ah said he they have sent some fencingmaster to fight with me the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound	229.9778
he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure	193.4527
i believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the matter then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her you aramis cried the three friends	107.1770
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom	107.3793
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something	108.4447
you are right sir said athos	17.6610
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world	113.6250
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities	231.5264
the poor girl ventured a glance at dartagnan which said see how i suffer on your account toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of dartagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss	223.2282
why not because he is an actor in the drama has he assassinated anyone then no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him	173.2178
well then the place will the place royale suit you asked dartagnan	156.3952
i must return to the ministers	1647.2897
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed you are here in the apartment destined for you madame	159.1520
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me	48.9757
the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it	117.9707
this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is	68.7604
de tréville listened to the young mans account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair	170.7649
who went out this morning athos asked uneasily	265195.8750
morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get alongsave yourselves we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it	216.2928
i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish	244.0152
do you hearnot a single creature obey that person implicitly	6538.0464
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations	270.1490
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes returned dartagnan	232.1842
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained	108.4373
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others	1066.7797
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer	173.4538
de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m	1716.0986
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel	185.1464
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name so he has but i like mine as well certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m	185.9288
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a sideglance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is prettyi think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing	190.6031
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england	68.1042
my god my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of him he has done us the honor to remain here what he had done you the honor to remain here yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy on what account of certain expenses he has contracted well but whatever expenses he may have incurred i am sure he is in a condition to pay them ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my blood	132.7957
are you going to rejoin your cardinal	180.9366
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops thats well said monte cristo i remain here a day or twoarrange accordingly as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter	273.5554
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars	458.5244
for the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable fidelity	2396.0300
ah you are his son he said that is a different thing sir i surrender said louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer	370.9091
bertuccio and to a kings attorney at that but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low	226.9633
sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them	105.2303
alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it	91.3973
dartagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think	294.7105
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune	135.1763
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties	155.4666
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me come now said athos you are joking in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said i supposed said athos that last nights conferences would modify those warlike arrangements no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair perhaps you speak the truth aramis well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with dartagnan porthos and possibly even raoul	137.3732
our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services does he wear them no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers he is a quaker then exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress has he any friends yes everyone who knows him is his friend but has he any enemies one only what is his name lord wilmore where is he he is in paris just now can he give me any particulars important ones he was in india with zaccone do you know his abode its somewhere in the chaussée dantin but i know neither the street nor the number m are you at variance with the englishman i love zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not friends do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris to that question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m	187.4737
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever	660.2292
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after dartagnan	169.8550
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity you laugh faintly	239.2046
the devil murmured he between his teeth	75.4956
i am frightful tonight she said	33.4816
theres no second constance in the world on his return to the cathedral dartagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan	106.8632
it was dartagnan who was waiting for him	46.6659
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that	289.5274
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner	86.3368
beware i have warned you but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him	175.9818
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything villeforts astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary	711.3821
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together	292.9756
noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orangepeel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo	256.4456
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story	89.9523
de saintméran oh doctor i would swear to it what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the other cases villefort ceased to contend he only groaned	189.6568
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemens permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him the servant bowed and retired	162.9345
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	48.0814
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together _ma foi_ said maximilian in consternation	143.5851
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge do you then believe in god said caderousse	141.1319
when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door	97.4271
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever wasfalse and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king	282.7022
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	86.4431
i have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts what a rope ladder yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes cant be sent around a ball like a letter no but it may be sent in something else in something elsein something else	240.5459
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching	1279.0184
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey and do you command nothing in your own name in my name said mme	121.2393
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy	125.5921
as they stopped at the door of the cardinals study dartagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder	131.7481
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbés dead body	341.2637
it was not without foundation that a report of the kings intention to leave paris by night had been circulated	193.1652
aramis look at that horse oh the frightful brute said aramis	361.4464
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words	122.6409
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a christian oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my life then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of itself my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	121.1685
besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash ones self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power	200.6191
i think he has not been arrested and as i am his wifes confessor if she knows where he is i shall know it too very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me we will be with you at six oclock my lord go my dear curate and may god assist you and you sir continued gondy turning to the curate of st sulpice	93.4468
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials	533.7926
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughters hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure	227.4260
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort	110.3363
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late	38.7706
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk	229.1624
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will	145.0967

but dartagnan had now slipped through the window	43.6719
have you lost it asked blaisois	386.2721
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer yes much said dartagnan who did not well know how to answer	140.3349
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape	224.2987
it was about four oclock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant outofdoors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern	125.1153
milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion	171.9481
not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering	201.8654

although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a steppingstone	202.4658
a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment	91.1005
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos	258.9895
that voice also was known to grimaud	44.2612
the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration	253.4264
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter	79.4434
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance dartagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athoss last remark he stopped short	140.6336

the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished	74.3962
let us go to rueil said athos	15.2036
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungryvery hungry and your excellency wants something to eat at once if possible nothing easier said peppino	363.8908

_pardieu_ monsieur said athos thats a proposition that pleases me not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman	167.9385
the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price	154.0804
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield	234.1914
explain to me why going out of this chamber isnt everything because having neither arms nor password we shouldnt take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms yes but before we can kill himand he will be hard to kill that swisshe will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun	262.7707
well said athos dont you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question	71.8809
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans	306.0334

with the first light dantès resumed his search	168.0822
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially	268.0366
sir he thus addressed dartagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell these words struck dartagnan like a thunderbolt	332.7428

carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence	474.4599

a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood	193.8666

this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true	129.4224

well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixtyfour years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous	235.8425
morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw	233.5115
if you had seen at what a pace he camelike the wind i should think soa horse that cost francs said monte cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son	295.8333

now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children rest assured put the gag in grimaud in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate	225.4873
the glance was of sublime eloquence	3712.6370
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt	97.8416
in ten minutes dartagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt	342.2411
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards	59.3642
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp is it not it is absurd said debray	104.6980
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm	437.4476
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself	838.5588
after this he took from his cupboard the banknotes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night	133.1095
but we know very well what had become of edmond	119.8946
his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell	386.2750
porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully well	1037.7324
oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches thou who like beings of a superior order to ourselves couldst understand the science of good and evil if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and sufferedthen noble heart sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some sign some revelation remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the count bowed his head and clasped his hands together	392.4153

yes my lord apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier dherblay now the abbé dherblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled	199.8776

i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan	461.7379
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other	96.8594
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening	117.3389
grimauds first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hours riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe	217.5764

morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein	2256.5500
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	187.3302
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him	43.9947
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority	228.2639

so that thanks to her friends generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the bestattired peasant near rome	699.0049
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed	106.4840
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat	64.2725
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear	156.1646
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister	94.8459
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	116.1305

once in london we shall be hard to findwithout considering continued athos throwing a glance at aramis the chances that may come to us on the way yes said aramis i understand i however do not understand said porthos	137.3562
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de larbresec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	378.8437
poor cardinal seven men in two days and those of his very best but thats quite enough gentlemen please to understand thats enough	315.8647

i recognize him it is the monk whispered porthos to aramis	190.9532
dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the water	143.7767
dont stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knifegrinder	203.8268
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary	461.2674
yes where at the louvre are you sure of it perfectly sure who told you of it madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know why did she not let me know sooner whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day well we are beaten now let us try to take our revenge i will assist you with all my heart monseigneur be assured of that how did it come about at half past twelve the queen was with her women where in her bedchamber go on when someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress and then the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then and then she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes i shall soon return she then opened the door of her alcove and went out why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly nothing was certain besides her majesty had said ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the queen how long did the queen remain out of the chamber threequarters of an hour none of her women accompanied her only donna estafania did she afterward return yes but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately and when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her no does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket yes the diamond studs which his majesty gave the queen and she came back without this casket yes madame de lannoy then is of opinion that she gave them to buckingham she is sure of it how can she be so in the course of the day madame de lannoy in her quality of tirewoman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the queen and then the queen the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired he must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or not i have just been with him and the goldsmith the goldsmith has heard nothing of it well well rochefort all is not lost and perhapsperhaps everything is for the best the fact is that i do not doubt your eminences genius will repair the blunders of his agentis that it that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed no monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that head but i know you monseigneur yes or at least i guess	164.4060

now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess	113.1666
villainous host cried he he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no better yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend dartagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal what by demanding my head of the cardinal cried dartagnan pale with terror	215.8234

pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace	316.2562

the poor devil would eat nothing from fear it is incredible no my dear fellow it is not at all incredible	112.8252

debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain	399.2976

somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily	1265.9952
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	155.8169
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed we hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire	164.0863

since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time thank you sir it will be well employed i hope cromwell turned as he was going	75.0489
i cannot account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable	161.2581
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors	120.9733
here you can get anything you want by paying for it of course as among honest folk of course cried danglars	404.3432

beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days	123.7747
i am anxious to see that young man nearer and wherefore aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that i am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man in beauty or on the contrary asked aramis laughing	110.0199

i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results	102.6602

at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door	235.8744
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these words there appeared in noirtiers eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine	146.4304

at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then sight returned and with it feeling and grief	266.1414
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m	188.9191

he was a man of twentyfive or twentysix years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them	334.7903

i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins poisondeath exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death	261.9777

no said morrel is someone dead in his house the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness	175.4298
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover	230.3338
it is a false diamond said caderousse	62.2594
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice miladys condescension	265.6787

oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant i shall be dressed athos then called olivain	219.7264

sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment	161.3611
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up thats all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers	160.5843
may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars m i have that honor and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred	120.4063
at sight of this man dartagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door	102.3779
madame exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old	834.1492

morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair	72.6407
oh how happy you make us no doubt you come to join the princes as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud	243.3304

is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied dartagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shutup houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven then monsieur is satisfied asked planchet	140.9691
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given	340.0689
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison	838.0355
a man whose name is franz dépinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda no he is a man about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a knittingneedle but he paid your ransom he said two words to the chief and i was free and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp	262.1780
whilst he thus hesitated the host reentered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot	213.9939
this time dartagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was	193.2614
spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend	184.1107
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner	539.1094
and the name of this lord lord de winter lord de winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband	44.7565
m excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away	85.3226
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his	65.0131
dépinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort	81.8734
it does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors and why among us four inquired caderousse	341.2443
the fourth and last side of your cell faces onfaces onstop a minute now where does it face the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber	248.2977
progress of cavalcanti the younger meanwhile m	388.5604
mother said the young man looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter what has occurredwhat has happened	424.4089
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinals fat face	164.5397
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos	78.3835
suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pelemele the intrenchments with the fugitives	687.7106
but this vessel which like the _pharaon_ came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the _pharaon_	171.6580
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent	200.3898
bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating	226.8154
danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of secondrate fortunes i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins	195.7690
come sir wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other key go and fetch it i will leave you the torch sir no take it away i can see in the dark why you are like no	111.0085
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation	168.8210
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door	62.6918
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours	321.6968
if i once went up those stairs	4238.2021
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him	210.1918
no sir and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you a glass of wine will be extremely welcome the fish bitesthe fish bites whispered the gascon to porthos	240.7686
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service	239.9842
the dailyrenewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeera service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy	176.1758
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her	151.1889
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing dartagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger	171.3762
i was promised he should die with me	88.4927
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head	119.6085
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time dartagnan was better informed than she was	193.4520
their connection could not last long without ruining both	1473.1853
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the barons banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m	168.6332
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier dherblay two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword	131.8947
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word	130.4206
tell me his name edmond dantès villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at fiveandtwenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch	312.6667
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the onehalf per cent it had originally paid	690.4025
the prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant	240.0442
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life	90.9492
you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock	238.2927
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on	524.4708
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i dont know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason	217.5609
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any waythat is if he approved of the person proposed	117.8335
it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the question	158.4298
she turned toward the wall to smilefor there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her	185.8233
never never the devil said athos	16.3208
danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence	311.0793
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way thats all	234.4271
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young mans shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size	261.2272
all four were to meet the next day at eleven oclock	32.2122
i was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness	141.7861
the matter was arranged as dartagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions	237.8792
no i will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged that is better said the gascon	292.4976
go to go to i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself	190.3909
wait for me here all of you cried m	101.6035
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a womans cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came	181.1223
do you still wish to do so i have no wishes count only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your word with me do i not ah count i shall forget it no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again oh count have pity upon me	108.6664
so he cherishes no resentment you are mistaken porthos said dartagnan	32.7269
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as dartagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but dartagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line	177.8782
m general dépinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell	134.7595
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke	52.0056
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of dartagnan and athos	612.7750
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case	114.9298
i feel myself drawn toward youi who have never loved anyone but my benefactori who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men	665.1816
have you brought your arms iwhat for	9925.4453
the peasant the gardener was rochefort whom he believed to be in the bastile	104.9016
the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii	161.7949
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him	85.9895
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and dartagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant	266.5861
when tomorrow evening if you like at what hour at ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have returned good there continued athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained alas murmured dartagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever dartagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that	186.8341
at the end of three months he had learned to write	58.3794
de villeforts promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible	145.6374
do you not father yes resolutely replied noirtier	14535.0352
now let us go m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement	117.2957
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent	154.0099
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger	183.5049
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof	248.8280
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said ah the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioners axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on	210.6270
he is walking about and thinking thought dartagnan but of what	353.9048
the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty	463.6326
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me	43.3191
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with dartagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter	141.3595
sir said davrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened	649.3242
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	111.7184
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need	135.1295
i am in his majestys guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied but it appears to me that my guardsmineare also his majestys guards and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words you want a pretext do you not	189.9901
franz thanked the count for his attention	137.4859
my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles dont speak of marseilles i beg of you maximilian that one word brings back my mother to my recollectionmy angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven	276.5312
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene	182.5611
in a few minutes a night watch passed	1662.9683
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table	241.3775
you said only imagineand then paused	4545.0020
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht	188.4584
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile	117.0029
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations	230.9305
both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay	52.8159
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder no i said very well sir you have gained the victory tomorrow perchance it will be our turn but father take care when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping i do not understand you you rely on the usurpers return we do you are mistaken he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble on the th or th he will be at lyons and on the th or th at paris the people will rise yes to go and meet him he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him yes to escort him into the capital	153.7361
no counti hopei assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort	84.2462
oh added a third voice the shrouds of the château dif are not dear m perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf they may give him the honors of the sack edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said	120.2238
the postscript is explicit i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz	90.0769
good said he it was timeand he sealed his will with three seals	1695.6849
ive remarked that your puritans revel in that color but can you find your man said aramis to athos	188.4894
you yes you have them i have them ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the francsah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them i do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything but happily the abbé busoni thought for you he is an excellent person he is extremely prudent and thoughtful he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you here they are the major clasped his hands in token of admiration	162.2790
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions	149.6562
the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom	183.6807
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house	81.0799
the joy of the king was lively	850.7668
ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despairah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them	568.2418
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity	1930.0873
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune	60.8632
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champsélysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel	239.0659

i tremble to give my permission listen valentine	3184.5728
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance	190.5775
you are inclining toward false doctrines my young friend you will be lost you will be lost said the curate shaking his head sorrowfully	87.3570
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be	275.1996
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband	249.0429
she was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with	458.4482
what was most pressing was to get mme	242.7216
try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption	1009.8593
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all how in the wrong said athos	134.8070
get me out of this in heavens name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard	117.1676
well what are you doing countto a former lackey	25995.2344
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them	278.2123
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him	99.1908
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence yieldyou yield to me do you not a giant had seized also aramiss two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp	312.5313
this lad for he was scarcely a mansimple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked goodextended his affection even to his judge spite of villeforts severe look and stern accent	615.1126
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends	244.0136
here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs	247.1968
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated	259.5760
we have quitted business how long inquired the astonished merchant	1011.7878
ah you fellows are good managers you ride on our lackeys horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads	369.0639
i found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend	79.4972
but where is your master he is following me the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet who made a sign to dartagnan	101.2749
a little better sir will you drink some of this ether and water i will try but dont touch me why not because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return drink barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him	156.6405
you love me my beautiful queen and you will weep for me oh my god my god cried anne of austria this is more than i can bear	61.5989
ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box	119.7875
her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his firstrate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife	437.8873
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him	139.9023
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case	529.0875
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease	149.7617
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty	305.8148
why it is as good as a century at what hour does the examination take place at two oclock send at twelve said danglars smiling	203.1337
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in mens clothes	1238.1860
de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it	199.4157
may i be permitted to inform my wife said he	56.5924
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from noyon in picardy you have several lawsuits and no attorney	760.1790
poor dear monsieur dartagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans hand	114.9605
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear	140.7410
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed	223.5294
here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain	230.3256
you seem a worthy young man i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation	109.2626
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer tis true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions	162.4558
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès thats all right edmond	89.6737
he will see us if we go out then you must come up into my room ah said mme	85.1080
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle darmilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs	246.3818
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions	190.7084
athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so skillfully no doubt	277.6082
besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but _she_ asked he in an undertone	348.2015
porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurators wife in the cloister of st magloire	121.1740
your eminence said comminges as i was reconducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door	197.2905
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door	14.2619
what is the matter monsieur said planchet	43.7848
what cried dartagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos yes that disturbs you by no means and here is the second dartagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis	163.5401
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away	184.5966
the movement was executed in silence and with precision	379.1920
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors	108.9536
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf said he	38.0675
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has refused	146.9947
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château dif that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villeforts promise	217.5354
have i any need to tell you so	38.0908
dartagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon dartagnans sword	395.2014
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger	117.6373
that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman	165.4987
god will help you gentlemen in the name of heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words	87.6050
m who could know that i was here already said the young man	49.2256
and i asked mazarin after a moments silence	136.1236
he laughs best who laughs last	1263.6322
are they all full grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty dartagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captains alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment	199.9888
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money	194.5667
you have received a regular letter of advice yes said danglars but i confess i didnt quite comprehend its meaning indeed and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation go on monsieur	161.3147
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the doorkeepers or the coolness of his colleagues	150.2871
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m	576.7844

from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate	277.2546

during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentines powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old mans meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted	252.0335
felton lowered his head and reflected	1297.9222
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection	148.5740
yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt	427.6633
but its of no importance continued dartagnan with natural assurance its of no importance	479.8412
did you not see that at that name the young man stopped more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business a quarrel asked athos	117.2109

_my mass_ lord de winter the corrupted catholic knows very well that i am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me and of what religion are you then madame asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal	105.7073
as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master	194.0583
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel	49.1202

this modern place of entertainment stood on the lefthand side of the post road and backed upon the rhône	221.6749
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths	728.1923
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing i doubt it planchet replied dartagnan but what are you thinking of i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested always cautious planchet tis instinct your honor well what does your instinct tell you now sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in ah ah said dartagnan planchets recital agreeing with his own observations	191.8571
he what he asked the cardinal	44.5885

oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris	182.4534
does the cardinal refuse to receive the king	45.3195
well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts did you not say so just now i did you have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the other it was thisthat while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune	194.7288

why should i risk an imprudent step	1799.4149
the bell and bottle tavern chapter	1863.9519
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not _come_ out of it but _fly_ like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks	213.6559

the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless	175.8930
ah cried porthos would i were but a baron well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken	111.2547
those were good old days never fearthese people owe us no grudge is your honor sure i can answer for it they do not well we wont speak of it any more then and planchet took his place in dartagnans suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed	212.0191
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé dherblay and in spite of bazins assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion	198.5180
the snow was falling thick and icy	78.1332
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his fathers right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either	128.2970
albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him	186.3443
the counts wellknown courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice	952.9509
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities	262.0632
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex	345.7682

whos up there said the man	70.6977
m edmond was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him	462.5433

de villefort spoke of it to mea paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire	372.2726
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french of rome i am glad to hear it baronfor i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants	99.4917
come here fellow bazin who was crossing the antechamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them	240.5376
if he were rich if he had cavalcantis fortune that might be pardoned	242.9187
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey	188.9142
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad for your father is indeed here and is seeking you the count from the moment of first entering the drawingroom had not once lost sight of the expression of the young mans countenance he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice but at these words so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and is seeking you young andrea started and exclaimed my father	119.3538

it is extraordinary he said when the door was closed behind him how easily these husbands whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room	186.6075

god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause	432.3289
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury	99.1576
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	355.1436
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol	115.2118
i would take the hundred pistoles	40.3594
what is the use of following the alleys	1008.1508

at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means	146.6002
you must die athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense	231.9393
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore	31.5585
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise withina timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard	270.8888
the horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall	138.7328

stop said albert here he comes	545.8051

no to answer you would be to forget it	53.0451
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me	231.1131
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	256.1849
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said dartagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought what monsieur cried dartagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason	110.4916
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give	104.5947
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement	837.4363
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it	491.6367
the discourse is over farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously	143.3929

the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road	233.0000
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	94.1824
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite	124.9101
hush said the captain it is a fire but you told me the island was uninhabited i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers and for pirates and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franzs words	300.8365
m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that momentwe will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderationbut sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès	349.4387
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire	317.1216
ah ah murmured he is dantès then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form	972.2495
luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time	502.8086
fifty thousand francs a year said porthos	56.7593
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when dartagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered herthese were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure	198.3094
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydée your sisterlet her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the counts voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo turned around haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement	191.4325
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and châteaurenaud	161.3456
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still	419.0006
it is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame	206.7298
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked dartagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england	119.5399
he dreamed that he was endowed with wingshe wished to fly away	1375.7209

i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i cannot understand how any man can really love her the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison no but tell meit is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	189.0453

do not call anyonedo not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the counts marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girls mind	153.9173
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst dartagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis	218.2684

nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentines future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you m noirtiers look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old mans mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle	148.3473
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back	99.1362

the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant	107.8593

lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers	835.5696
and i say that murders _are_ committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months	366.6060
rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at franz	186.0253
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read	74.5219
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rosetrees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season	316.8414
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door	229.0746
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me i pardon you monseigneur said bonacieux hesitating to take the purse fearing doubtless that this pretended gift was but a pleasantry	251.1265
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others	103.1459
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury	312.4452
we have still fifteen days before us said he to his friends well if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing or rather if nothing has come to find me as i too good a catholic to kill myself with a pistol bullet i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminences guards or with eight englishmen and i will fight until one of them has killed me which considering the number cannot fail to happen	151.1769
morrel yes but we will talk of it well then three months said penelon	216.2988
i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution i told you true replied he coldly	79.7957
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again	158.6005
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast	293.2823
the pistol fell from his hands	43.9195
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth i am a ruined man lost destroyed bah said athos we were always dry if you had been contented with drinking well and good but you have broken all the bottles you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down	195.5151
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellencythere has been such a drought come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration	253.8669
we might start at five oclock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels	129.9792
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them	590.9278
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawingroom with her little edward	94.4154
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fishermans hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years	197.2665
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you	293.7873
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period	200.4150
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms	334.1599
de villefort and valentine at the same time	10.0940
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de winter	362.7941
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him	81.6567
is supper ready signor pastrini yes your excellency well then let us sup but the carriage and horses said franz	93.2359
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife	266.6653
de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders	220.9878
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal	102.9370
what do you say to this mother and albert took out of a little pocketbook with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little dooralbert took out of this pocketbook a note of francs	212.4620
we have so many worlds in the year of grace in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue come come that is not bad said lucien	180.6850
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos	36.0396
cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone	196.0164
dartagnan does not tell you raoul said athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his timea knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire thats what his adversary met with	259.8941
i have nothing to save for your majesty you are only the victim of perfidious plots that is true that is true my child said the queen you are right give me then that letter madame time presses the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and pens	169.6336
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that cannot be described	86.5089
m a girl of six or seventhat is a little younger than vampatended sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa	750.3961
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth my fifty recruits from the chevalier dhumieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks and where are you going to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him	219.1353
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m	150.6303
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl	485.5004
on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master	544.5603
all this will not advance your outfit said athos for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you	93.4693
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marblelike features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	224.5235
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head	108.4882
de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously m	91.3475
there said dartagnan this is capital now let me try on the dress of yonder chap	342.7101
alight planchet and inquire for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do planchet alighted	151.8133
patience madame i am coming to it thats fortunate in april you went to dine at the ministers	220.0061
there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twentyfive thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander vi	542.7850
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant yes well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you certainly	192.4742
this adjoins the lower part of the governors apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lockup cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured	373.1870
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by gods	257.4576
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head	360.9290
now i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics and that in all humility that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little	193.9434
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the kings attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship _pharaon_ this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and portoferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris	144.4792
i felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent	216.5747
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name	448.8539
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation	115.1109
oh real enough from anxiety doubtlessat any rate they postponed the matter for two months	538.6643
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family	175.6882
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii	4933.6846
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur créquy another time at my own house in the country in my château atwhen i had a château a third time at monsieur de trévilles where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman	195.7762
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof	155.1707
the man placed his finger on her lips	22.4165
i threw and i lost what my horse your horse seven against eight a point shortyou know the proverb athos you are not in your right senses i swear my dear lad that was yesterday when i was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this morning	208.9010
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl	38.8805
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me fie madame fie said porthos as if disgusted	203.1978
how do you mean the receipt of m	121.2140
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon ali obeyed leaving the abbé alone with caderousse who had not yet revived	228.6452
do you think it will be long before he comes in no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten oclock well i will go and take a turn in the champsélysées and at ten oclock i will return here meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin	92.7217
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house take care said madame de villefort the kings attorney is here ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration your declaration said villefort	72.7305
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it you dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse	381.1211
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame	214.4326
who is this young person m	506.6886
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitiche was in prison	398.5251
my sole heir that i have bu	4515.6577
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops	320.6035
dartagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de trévilles place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey well i am in a maze said porthos do _you_ approve of what dartagnan has done _parbleu_ indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it and now gentlemen said dartagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for allthat is our motto is it not and yet said porthos	177.8453
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared	192.4974
living my best friends would avoid my house dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home	223.9009
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house	278.6675
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back	1056.6599
i recognized your name in it	90.1050
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you	212.4746
to the swords be it so replied dartagnan that is exactly what i want dartagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause	190.8226
yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i cannot answer as to what i may do myself be prudent in any event said the countess	177.3741
the counts anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man	118.1767
my lord said dartagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere willingly said the cardinal i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos	67.0558
the fact is said dartagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment	948.6863
help help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue	305.1635
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa	138.7025
everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood	106.8574
bertuccio i need you no longer	19.2126
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks where do you come from from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost	241.8536
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me	118.6653
it is true she said the arch hypocritesee i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces	416.3996
then all looked at each otherhe was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart freeperfectly free	228.0942
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited dartagnan to drink	265.5759
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemys army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle	119.7214
caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court	187.6014
escape as lord de winter had thought miladys wound was not dangerous	369.9378
is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m	183.7535
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead	58.4885
de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france	142.1289
morrel and then ran on to mercédès	694.1780
they are no doubt both curious and interesting yes yes but let us go	121.6251
dartagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m	213.0376
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground	120.3777
bayonne yes the road to bayonne and afterwards the road to châtillon yes by the tower of montlhéry you mean yes thank you	210.8737
doctor pray recall your words you have said nothing have you my dear m	66.1229
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts	78.4673
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in peace i doubt that replied dartagnan for they are advancing very resolutely	109.1627
mordaunt mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed dartagnan	208.7151
dartagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the kings musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place he was considered beforehand as a comrade	119.2293
ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities	374.4493
davrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered	105.2798
i say that he has hastily accused your majestys musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself	206.9411
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men i have measured them	168.9598
make way for us planchet said dartagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass they are friends the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again	123.5990
the door had been opened and shut again the mercers pretty wife had disappeared	410.7034
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignitiesthe comte de la fere comte de bragelonne and he has no children with all these titles ah said porthos i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly what athos	121.8657
de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline	2847.1233
think of it madame he said if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands she listened panting overwhelmed crushed her eye alone lived and glared horribly	326.1476
speak my friend i listen there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear oh yes yes exclaimed dantès and i tell you that i will save you yet well then try	125.1682
about five oclock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting	185.3309
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass	697.0395
he is asleep and the spanish woman dreaming and the cursed italian he is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away its for some purpose rely on it	286.4670
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled	252.3776
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience	210.1817
he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house	66.2259
we say _almost_ for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens it	174.5660
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows	244.3788
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously	514.0809
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection	433.7202
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow	241.0744
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying great god exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand	207.6036
the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand	166.0993
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire horrible cried de winter the daughter of henry iv and the wife of king charles wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle dorleans was spoken of said de winter	172.7775
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house then you abandon me doctor yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold	147.7238
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her	665.5833
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its silence	1322.6603
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him	157.8676
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe	127.4338
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind	153.8326
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself	87.8848
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count	468.8026
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence	309.8748
you do not understand me gentlemen said dartagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun	106.7146
well i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at me then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels faith yes almost said raoul	170.6476
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say	132.8266
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray	103.5115
the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true worth	254.9444
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature	106.6781
no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothedmademoiselle eugénie danglars eugénie danglars said monte cristo tell me is not her father baron danglars yes returned morcerf a baron of a new creation what matter said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction enormous ones answered beauchamp	201.0524
no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscounts door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was falsebesides why should he tell a falsehood	105.1133
yes but in my soul much more than in my body we will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of bethune as these people say that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claimthat is to say i was but am no longer it is fifteen years since i gave up the office	112.8209
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court	363.8966
the first notary handed over each note as he examined it to his colleague	178.1558
oh no he exclaimednot die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much die	263.6266
going along dartagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not	144.0199
nevertheless monsieur de trévilles company of musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will	176.1962
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man	115.4303
oh no sir from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me	213.8564
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch	206.2919
noirtierfor it was indeed he who enteredlooked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents	154.5147
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement	102.6215
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king to the king but the king is asleep i have something important to reveal to him can it not be put off till tomorrow he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late come then said lord winter	106.1818
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness thanks my captain replied dartagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general	132.7975
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself	119.2268
they fire like grooms said porthos	25.2146
i cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant	160.4395
sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper and how did this despatch reach you inquired the king	190.4514
madame danglars is ill said villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage oh _mon dieu_ said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smellingbottle i have mine said madame de villefort and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward	137.9780

in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousses letter	151.7891
when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms	117.0940

nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	263.5634
look and dartagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred	325.6229

i will give you said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone i brought just that sum with me oh thats no matter replied caderousse i will go back with you to fetch the other francs no returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to caderousse no it is worth no more and i am sorry i offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which i had not seen	119.8189

dartagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses	214.4836
frightful frightful murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for	146.8507
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before	123.4297

bowing under the weight of twentyfour years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of châteaurenaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her sons life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young mans heart every feeling of filial piety	220.6511

out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained	327.4828

yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money	162.1800

if i ever find him againand i will find him i swear were it in hell he was waiting for a woman continued tréville	183.0496

athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman	74.5608
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door	130.1183

no longer could edmond look into those wideopen eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	181.5708

with the dukes aid they already considered themselves invincible	3049.5430
he decided then to tell all	174.4839

in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study	310.0121
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrates first impulse was to pause	320.6591
on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a workbasket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planksthe earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter	229.3606
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr oreilly	226.9716
no monsieur it is impossible i can go no farther what does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo	123.2137
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up	207.8286
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood	114.6920
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god	229.5720
oh as for that ill take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horses bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him	155.2667
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	256.3335
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter reentered it	256.5217

the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume	221.9999
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon	277.5135
dartagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat	156.3582
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please	88.5970
no you do not know me i have done all in my power to oppose it ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend alberts account on my account said the young man oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended	109.5199
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling	99.2312
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress	61.2277
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone	68.0643
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down	234.6501
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz dépinay to pass a fortnight at venice	147.7084
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the redtinted horizon	654.2456
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven oclock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	150.0402
speak speak in heavens name and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair	151.0244
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay	596.0295
remember the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated	1364.9838
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor	626.9064
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done	111.0416
the hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence	162.4136
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman the sailor departed without reply	251.8047
not a step further he shouted the queen is signing what are you saying asked the queen	117.8810
at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light	758.5981
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franzs ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet wellpitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum	251.6655
the procureur no the doctor yes you wish to remain alone with m	73.1105
are you french sir said he to athos	58.8471
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo	218.2231
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon	1401.5281
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him	48.9590
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men	202.7158
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maidservant	269.3242
you will take their places and i shall not lose by the exchange	60.2540
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword the two gentlemen then went into the church	81.5655
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door	188.8749
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired	114.3866
a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain	165.1708
i think rather than give pain to my dear mother i would run the risk of offending the count monte cristo turned away he seemed moved by this last remark	178.7971
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale	212.2375
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish	1190.5924
come then my friend we will go forward havent you something to say to monsieur de flamarens on your own account my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary and how long ago was that when i last drew my poniard ah good another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt	151.3592
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice	239.3691
well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part i am indeed rejoiced said andrea	218.2860
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative	2583.9814
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothingwithout reckoning mousquetons wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with dartagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left and i about ten pistoles said aramis	240.2497
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat	269.9246
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing	249.9889
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either m alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life	265.5222
now dherblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached dartagnan	172.2374
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour	117.6006
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only two yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos	118.8498
when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m	421.6506
nevertheless raoul you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saintremy the youth looked pleased	130.0477
i have heard monsieur dartagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him speak monsieur speak said dartagnan who instinctively scented something advantageous	304.8976
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me	140.5592
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio	234.0512
theres only the price we are not agreed about how not agreed about said caderousse	255.0156
noirtier at one of the open windows where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony	197.7732
let us break the carriage cried the people	86.6537
the comte de la fere cannot be far off only the doors are locked that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for gods sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve	240.4396
thank god we dont want either rope ladders or gagpears now my lord said athos do not let us disturb you	351.4119
if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank i do not like anyone to deny his origin oh you are a thorough democrat said monte cristo smiling	111.4248
to paris first i have affairs to settle and they both set out for paris	185.1466
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup together	208.8996
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face	419.7053
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons she will ruin us returned the prince	149.3261
godo you hear said villefort while davrigny advanced to lead morrel out	509.9261
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him	259.9944
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier dartagnan lieutenant of his majestys musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known dartagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos	127.7721
if you know a prayer say itfor you are condemned and you shall die at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed her	170.0173
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house	103.8443
the night passed in perfect silence	610.1119
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed and porthos and aramis i could not find them they did not come but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them yes monsieur well dont budge then if they come tell them what has happened	163.7928
but what are you looking for i am looking for the person who let down the ladder	121.5872
tell me now if persistence is not a virtue my faith but this is droll cried dartagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter	184.8841
consider well what you do in that house	113.0656
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois	835.4210
oh yes she said i saw but i cannot believe would you rather die then and cause maximilians death oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the housecan i not escape valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape	220.8345
that womanthat woman which the one with a white dress and so many diamondsthe fair one madame danglars i do not know her name but it is she sir it is she whom do you mean the woman of the gardenshe that was _enceinte_she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end	142.2742
what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel	233.8632
no sir before all who are here alberts witnesses looked at each other	236.6484
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round	486.4146

come first of all said athos to dartagnan my friend that i may shake hands with youyou our rescueryou the true hero of us all athos is rightyou have my adoration said aramis in his turn pressing his hand	356.5410
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with	241.8919
whoi cried milady i a protestant	81869.9453
keep watch from seven to nine	1413.1820
never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully	712.1291
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard	91.5333
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind	228.5763
i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the th of september and that i am the son of the procureur m	42.8721
he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwells letter	142.0318
in order to make ones way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman	366.6649
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hellthat is the point m really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning	469.0204
now attach him to our party	1221.2716
at the end of threequarters of a league within fifty paces of festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by horses	420.9868
i admire i love himfor i know his former adventuresbut i shall not speak to him until the day after tomorrow and why day after tomorrow asked madame de chevreuse	107.5185
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him	82.1412
our blow has failed for tonight let us withdraw	525.2806
and why your excellency will know when you have read the letter shall i find you here then certainly franz entered the hotel	116.4171
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land	223.1564
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a skyblue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness	133.8948
and then resumed dartagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his masterstay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following	325.0583
the abbé told me it was worth francs muttered caderousse	311.2237
ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed friquet	514.4561
my sister is happily married her husband is only my brotherinlaw that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life	246.5610
dartagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side	178.9226
i am brave when i set about it	221.4931
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable	112.6958
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewelbox so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left	172.9675
ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to dartagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture	59.6970
moreover you are our prisoners fool cried aramis knowest thou not then mordaunt	660.9792
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive	299.0083
valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husbands arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow	441.2624
my place of abode is no avenue des champsélysées but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home	240.9851
the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity wasnt his name faria inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor	204.4430
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent	228.9513
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope	43.1959
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristos table and that of signor pastrini	105.7725
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist	223.7380
oh work workmy passion my joy my delightit is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of davrigny	568.8544
de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden	43.3019
a fête was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance	129.8764
farewell he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	57.8048
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window	157.8086
in fact four men such as they werefour men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single pointmust inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem	756.7790
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses i have no horse said dartagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de trévilles that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine one of yours how many have you then asked dartagnan	94.9945
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered	76.0599
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time	95.7620
on the evening of the th of september m	151.4422
do not let us do things in a hurry	223.5406
cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends i am at your service sir replied the major	58.1892
m a quarter of an hour was the reply	65.2526
so beautiful so young cried felton covering that hand with his kisses	408.5650
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves	912.9690
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered	312.9414
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved	721.2250
you a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown	102.1802
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m	128.4874
truly a byronic hero franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfreds shoulders or beneath laras helmet	662.2089
what shall we do said athos	23.2693
the chocolate was inoffensive for m	243.6378
well said she you see he refuses yes but why need this annoy you you know albert women are singular creatures	522.3954
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travellingcarriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no and stopped in the yard	132.3200
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbés cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue	149.8595
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape	74.9503
_salite_ said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant	49.3523
these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army	229.1365
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed	435.6784
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said	37.0577
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates	97.0699
it was now athoss turn to take a sly look	166.1561
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england	83.9596
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter my lordyour friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand	167.5757
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand	199.6084
dartagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings whereas mme	117.7509
what does the animal say asked the duke	51.2645
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand	375.3632
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating ladys men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day the _bonnes fortunes_ of de tréville were talked of as those of m	559.9612
i told you so exclaimed madame de villefort	12.4197
i hope it does not exceed she stopped speech failed her	2471.2681
the blood had mounted to the head of dartagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis	82.7958
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed	1471.5221
were they then so necessary they were indispensable the major passed his hand across his brow	128.0868
at last i mastered my agitation	5251.6597
i saw madame de saintméran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said châteaurenaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body	243.3856
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded	229.1008
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk	95.5691
dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	210.3570

as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away	102.5923
well he shall live mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristos eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect themfar more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir	444.8136

the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the barons countenance would not have led him to suspect it	118.8312
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four oclock to fetch him from the rospoli palace	93.3645
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascons eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd	315.7746

athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful smile	7490.7764

tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright	116.3658
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor and ii tell you against both	100.4529
dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldiers eyes	160.4239
his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen	208.2528
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance	142.5320
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house	299.5633
thats well said athos let us go home and read it the note burned the hand of dartagnan	99.8191
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor	142.1085

this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee	79.6224
at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park	58.6258
de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake noirtiers eyes demanded the nature of her mission	1023.5182
you sent me a strange madman this morning see the state in which he has put me oh my lord cried the baron i shall never console myself and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to him	71.5438
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening	299.0896
ah by notre dame as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms	287.0046
it was nine oclock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour	110.1939
all was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall	192.4417
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him	209.7303
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting these words redoubled the eagerness of dartagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace	206.4308
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property	275.0878
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed oh my woundminetis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that i have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at cambrin	137.0046
what then are you i am about to tell you wretched man oh mon dieu i am john francis de winter i do not know you said the executioner	87.0867
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face	232.5559
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh	204.5754
on entering the room noirtiers eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room	90.3817
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan	233.2283
did edmond make you his heir no merely his testamentary executor	8520.0586
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majestys attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary siron the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled	172.9574
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary	200.7679
simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton	214.8557
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family	115.5762
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice	39.8517
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable	88.7319
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs	256.8760
it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death	149.7117
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles	371.5031
but dont let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your masters orders	185.1271
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said goodnight and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier	203.4296
hark i dont think he put the faucet in again	725.1376
at any rate tell me theres more chance of fighting in paris is there not in that respect my dear friend its delightful	224.1124
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris	96.2224
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door	51.2372
the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master	156.4644

what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas this wound my dear dartagnan has been a warning to me from heaven this wound	206.8785
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment	180.0810
m theres nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose	269.1650
the brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with miladys favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet	201.5190
go the musketeers set off and dartagnan was left alone with raoul	173.0918
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation	130.6145
he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his lettersinbad the sailor which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil oh do you then know him cried julie whose eyes sparkled with joy	197.0451
one day the young shepherd told the counts steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock	231.1675

half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly	177.2783
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation	183.0470
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m	103.9997
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak	454.1674
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame	2102.5750
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day	78.5286
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos	357.0975
where is the key you speak of here it is ah my lord you will conduct us yourself then to that door very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door	104.2731
m you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort	107.2699
milady oh yes said porthos true i had forgotten it athos looked at him intently	137.6481
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours monte cristo shrugged his shoulders	110.7964
villefort retired to his study and davrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead m	357.2336
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone	305.2946
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximiliantoo rich	217.8505
why dont we go in with them asked porthos	129.5412
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides	248.2334
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker	417.0207
no i hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out that is possiblego i am going said albert as he made his parting bow	138.6635
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse	1426.2427

and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear not at all my good friend how	126.3474
morrel relaxed his hold of valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain	195.5846

just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin	602.3633
there is a third and the most terriblethat is my condition as a mortal being	451.8960
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king	55.0528
it was a strange thing and one which made dartagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder	251.7598
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son	112.8650

their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto	462.0984
de monte cristo and myself possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life	201.4846
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just nowblood will have blood	1306.9373

without having been in the school of the abbé faria the worthy master of _la jeune amélie_ the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support	284.3060
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort levêque	285.3010
there were collected and piled up all alberts successive caprices huntinghorns bassviols flutesa whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting foils boxinggloves broadswords and singlesticksfor following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandys education fencing boxing and singlestick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher	1254.0173
de boville who was standing in the waitingroom and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left	93.2002
another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbés speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards	149.5790
how exquisitely coselli sings his part but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is well then what do you say to la specchia	193.5831
it was easy to call his jailers attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the shortlived satisfaction of his own curiosity	276.8366
i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the count	323.1687
athos had even gone so far as to question m	98.3532
can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist then we do not see those beings to whom you allude yes we do you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form	152.7754

ah my dear friend said madame danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact	123.9910
time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose	399.2578
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m	49.3529
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning	95.3062
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all i want oh muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him how misfortune humbles a man i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges	128.2456
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other good the other three exclaimed	296.5363
write to me at paris to m	54.9339
julie threw herself into his arms	132.5360
you see it is yourself who have first named heryou her father have pity on valentine listen it is impossible	430.4305
i am temporarily commander of the _pharaon_ with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue	166.1828
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking nevertheless or find some one else continued dartagnan turning his back	120.0760
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected	75.9934
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom	97.1598
take care of the executioner dartagnan all right	473.5723
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me	358.0591
and now monsieur dartagnan he said prepare to set off for saint germain and take a letter from me to the queen chapter lxxxviii	123.7902
m what is he doing there said the inspector	50.0413
but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor the young man is better said danglars	248.0935
i feel if this continues said mme	130.1812
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all knowpoor franz dépinay ah true said debray you did fight some time ago about what m the devil take me if i remember returned châteaurenaud	179.7357
spur your horses whip get on the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body	254.5921
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse	186.3395
de villefort so that no one could reach the sickroom excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward	247.1700
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard	103.5958
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear	326.1292
the effect of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy	477.4764
above all she is very richat least i believe so said monte cristo	209.5737
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars	117.2218
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace	175.8309
he fell back almost fainting in his chair	33.5817
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great ladyfor she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass	210.6424
in that case we are as well off as we wish and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about silence porthos said aramis	147.7956
danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod	458.7366
and gabrielle destreesas goodnatured as brave as proud and above all as gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated	604.0209
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it tell it me sir formerly said the count i was athos madame de chevreuse looked astonished	180.3843
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door	110.1627
we have said that at halfpast twelve oclock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage	102.6756
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least	83.7010
milady looked at this man and hesitated	136.6012
de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult	389.7365
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives	287.9005
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose	90.3511
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that ofwhat the devil are their namesdartagnan and porthos dartagnan and porthos ah yes	154.4283
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	30846.1777
were it liquid gold monsieur blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine	440.7537
what will you let me be killed	93.0330
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo	74.6408
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitors cross that lesser criminals were executed	443.1515
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption what then to do	324.6424
all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately	449.4020
nonsense said dartagnan you would do as much mr humanity in a battle	305.7779
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound and grimaud threw the dagger on the table	132.7544
de saintméran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	523.2752
i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke and even then when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces	420.7234
edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes	186.1828
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it the cardinal repressed a smile	148.7206
raoul had offered some opposition at first but dartagnan made use of the comte de la feres name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army	159.2594
once sir when i was grafting a rosetree well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another ah that is another case i should be turned off and lose my pension three hundred francs a hundred crowns yes sir so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things not even for fifteen years wages	199.6084
dont alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and i will contrive it well ill seeill try to contrive some way said andrea	304.3465
as usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the château dif got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island	611.9466
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly	8195.3408
how do you do madame dantès mercédès courtesied gravely and saidthat is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband	307.1641
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	443.0767
if succor be sent to me i will accept it ah madame said monte cristo you should not talk thus it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free agents alas exclaimed mercédès if it were so if i possessed freewill but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief	133.1824
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere very good thought dartagnan tis our road likewise we will go together all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones	206.3545
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her	80.1156
my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m	169.7440
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it	157.2958
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated	454.5197
why for him and not for me	70.3940
unfortunately for dartagnan among the spectators was one of his eminences guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it	132.3451
so i think and therefore i said were our object money only but we want something else replied the gascon	221.5904
come come sleepy head quick the ladder but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window the other one the gardeners	410.3041
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away	195.3713
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know tis true replied dartagnan	92.0792
the _morbleus_ the _sang dieus_ the _morts touts les diables_ crossed one another in the air	1587.0522
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me	287.4433
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive	227.2972
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage	164.2897
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so	105.5276
but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted	188.6795
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself	485.9095
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace	1522.3422
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbés chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick mans couch	170.0530
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister	395.2468
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity	330.0170
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed	398.5569
m florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill and he hastened to the door	138.9262
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron	703.3756
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	111.1783
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel	101.7582
dartagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him	119.7290
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme	25074.8242
alas sir said he i cannot but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you i certainly am surprised replied m	273.0596
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian	177.3280
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart adieu count said the abbé dherblay i return to my convent adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach tomorrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening adieu gentlemen said the count i am going to sleep twentyfour hours i am just falling down with fatigue the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look	172.8093
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey	882.2122
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you	116.7564
debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain	229.8950
he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier	130.9379
his majesty has so good a heart that he cannot understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained	399.6629
to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb	375.1641
they reached the rue st honoré and in the place du palaiscardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades	328.3820
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him a guinea each per day and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed you forget aramis one precaution of considerable importance what is that the precaution of changing our clothes changing our clothes exclaimed porthos	181.5543
the kings procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism	385.7451
having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board _la jeune amélie_ distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him	364.1540
is there anyone in the lobby said the president	174.7477
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own	330.2040
you are sure there is nobody there said the stranger	165.1668
in the name of heaven explain yourself oh monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied dartagnan	90.9027
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron	60.9844
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered	324.4990
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she	109.6352
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect	151.6366
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the _bourgeoisie_ seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	294.8241
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion	106.7496
they carried a banner on which could be read this strange device we are seeking our king the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses	392.4115
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started	95.7112
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them	175.7882
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people	154.8878
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenantgeneral the count of morcerf peer of france oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretchto reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me no i did not say i was a stranger to you	196.7618
fortunately morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came	144.3150
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above anothers	302.2029
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence	226.7749
go to blin or véronique for your clothes	123.0296
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferryboats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to postparis presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions	691.8526
i have charged myself with this affair	146.3353
which is my best cavalry horse vulcan and the best hack bayard what horse dost thou choose for thyself i like rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me strong thinkest thou half norman half mecklenburger will go night and day that will do for us	1074.2584
he called it using his advantages	16943.5625
ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced	522.3214
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration	304.6895
dartagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his example	154.7784
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament	311.3203
i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error	71.3503
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	184.2680
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly	110.2055
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	209.1513
oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist	484.8589
dartagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but athos raised his hand	121.3709
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the _danseuse_ who acquired such a reputation in london	302.3238
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted	128.8043
the motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy	178.8583
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	167.5151
aramis porthos and dartagnan drew their chairs near him	389.6828
it is of an original color said aramis i never saw one with such a hide in my life i can well believe it replied dartagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him	122.9983
i merely ask you did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels	93.1199
you are deceived monsieur i know her very well ah said mme	104.4474
really my dear gérard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men	227.3799
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind	127.0458
in a few minutes valentine reentered the garden alone	256.3469
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honori think perhaps too oftenthat i am in haste great haste	481.5201
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty	77.3857
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love	131.1823
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debrays apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions	121.2898
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy	194.7376
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	146.3132
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course	133.8818
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him	166.3168
go in whatever guise you choose for my part i shall go unarmed no for i will not allow you to do so	96.9461
and now my dear child adieu for the present	170.9115
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old mans eyes	53.6159
say to her peace or war my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me	194.9266
juxon cried charles juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting moment the bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the inglenook	221.5816
as for the duc de beaufort he arrived from vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces	291.3985
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected	2041.7216
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion	155.1839
then morrel came out from his hidingplace with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen	98.6174
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger	198.0056
i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child	112.8050
he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him	84.1013
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes	466.9128
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish half past seven had sounded	289.4724
the man of meung replied dartagnan and disappeared	63.2903
nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it is have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the preference where shall i find the governor at his country house and that is situated at a quarter of a league from the city	110.3700
by the lord my good host i must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles mercy cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master i am a ruined man grimaud is a wellbred lackey	207.0484
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body	340.0105
de bovilles countenance yet he made an effort at selfcontrol and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum thats no affair of mine replied the englishman that is the affair of the house of thomson french in whose name i act	86.0501
four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles a pistole is not enough said dartagnan tis worth a louis what is worth a louis four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis four hundred said porthos	171.2305
i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it	400.1034
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence the jury took their seats m	191.5754
is the baroness at home inquired danglars	248.0102
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there	55.7920
what has just happened yes said the count you are rightit is miraculous for albert is brave resumed morrel	196.8154
by men of heart i mean men of courage	397.0227
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur i am a criminal as it appears	160.1072
i began to fear that he would not come	34.4192
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched	147.8949
they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summerhouse overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library	310.5242
dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless	226.9008
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age	554.9215
the carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen	57.4797
darminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion	194.5835
the first object that met the eyes of dartagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions	213.2917
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis	146.4477
for i think you told me it was a boy m	36.3592
look out cried dartagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder	2579.5864
yes but i am expecting some one a friend of athos a friend exclaimed the count	109.7123
i have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a hussy	648.9500

instead of that louisedo you understandair liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples	3091.8674
a sort of book written upon strips of cloth go and fetch it my good fellow and if it be what i hope you will do well i will run for it sir and the guide went out	115.4561
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose	153.5913
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	86.8388
danglars appeared delighted with you was he not	156.8580
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself dantès obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following m this th day of april being invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi and fearing that notcontent with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and reserves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisonedi declare to my nephew guido spada my sole heir that i have buried in a place he knows and has visited with me that is inthe caves of the small island of monte cristo all i possessed of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems that i aloneknow of the existence of this treasure which may amount to nearly two millions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth rock from the small creek to the east in a right line	274.9851
the guards looked on it with indifference	765.8348
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alonelong enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	477.3712
on the staircase he met signor pastrini	615.8975
bonacieux but why then did you cry out so do you not understand said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind	98.1750
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance	1240.5701

unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut upcaptured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered	260.7177
there madame he said is monsieur gondy who hastens to obey your majestys summons the queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded	567.0986
you know what athos told you the other day you eat at everybodys mess	442.3764
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis	136.2924
they are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers those are all asked grimaud	297.4419
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment	136.4638
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchengarden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet	272.4591
constancy and discretion well asked he when franz had finished what do you think of that i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance i think so also replied albert and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of braccianos ball franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker	120.3918
de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saintméran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles	181.7451
at this cry all the crowd reentered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult	307.1461
alas said dartagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to meto me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile	210.4491
we are carrying too much canvas	60259.7188
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé	76.2085
de tréville waited for the king	72.6494
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos	174.1815
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams	338.9023
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosomhe also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another	131.9828
dartagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword	35.6650
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear	92.1165
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother	156.2659
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg	217.4184
my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused	166.1338
no replied athos fortunately monsieur dartagnan has only fainted ah indeed so much the better said lord de winter	65.7140
they will believe he is arrested and that will give him time in three days i will tell them who i am and they cannot fail to let me go bravo athos noble heart murmured dartagnan	107.6797
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated	523.2605
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny	257.2247
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance good said milady to herself who knows i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the vein she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor	236.3265
athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the luxembourg	119.4795

i was so delighted to see her again i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris for the cause which today takes us to england and what is this cause demanded aramis	153.9747
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn	9333.7910
what do you require then i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke she is found said milady	151.3610
these details will guide her on her part and on your return i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you	97.8761
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	149.5955
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress	118.4067
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road	161.6812

in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badlyas witness chalais and mme	306.8652

grimaud is it thou grimaud signified that he was not mistaken	37.6721
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blundersi mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more is there indeed my good fellow	342.7593

franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	3127.0068
there was a great deal going on that morning and many businesslike persons at the palais businesslike persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	488.0178
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil	465.4541
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone	181.9312
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid	79.2080
well thought dartagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my faultfor it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him	175.3944
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly	406.7256
keep your journey a secret do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done return with all speed enter marseilles at night and your house by the backdoor and there remain quiet submissive secret and above all inoffensive for this time i swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies	205.6524
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket never mind we shall see tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio	372.7516
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head	82.1798
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace	80.8655
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it	250.2628
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens	637.2879
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head why i says i still think youve got too much on i think youre right answered he we shall have a gale a gale	440.0374
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawingroom and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	177.5466
i am acquainted with it before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined dartagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance dartagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs	226.6600
the baroness then thought of m	210.6231
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us his voice went to my heart observed julie and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before chapter	118.3397
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis add monsieur dartagnan my lord	123.6716
as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted	154.7116
now madame danglars feared eugénies sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle darmilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debrayan expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mothers amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers	473.8370
his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly	349.0596
the four muskets made but one report but four men fell	445.5319
i command you not to stirattempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings	321.5484
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls	103.5620
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey	83.2824
he entered and on his way met the waiter	539.9617
yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are wretch cried dartagnan speak quickly who employed you to assassinate me a woman whom i dont know but who is called milady but if you dont know this woman how do you know her name my comrade knows her and called her so	136.2457
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word	150.1492
de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor	20.1137
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses what is it be so good as to give me up your sword count athos smiled and opened the window	64.5292
nearly ten minutes passed i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart	133.9029
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung bravo villefort cried the marquis excellently well said come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten	359.5627
he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreamsa coffer long and deep locked bolted fastened in the wall a coffer of which he had so often heard and which the handsa little wrinkled it is true but still not without eleganceof the procurators wife were about to open to his admiring looks	277.3215
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem	3376.5603
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door	167.6360
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our timeit is precious	299.3901
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell	70.1731
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	611.1587
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget	252.4586
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken	267.3840
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained francs	61.1292
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which dartagnan is blindly governed	667.6089
franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce	495.0931
you know the marquis of saintméran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival yes said monte cristo i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them but that is not all not all no they were going to marry their daughter to m	173.6730
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead the devil cried dartagnan	427.2269
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him	120.5106
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel	379.4839
this fortress was his post as kings attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition	488.2287
the devil thou dost not dost know where porthos is nonot at all and aramis not in the least the devil the devil the devil but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is where is he at notre dame what has he to do at notre dame he is beadle bazin beadle at notre dame he must know where his master is without a doubt he must dartagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out	147.6860
her will be done like that of god in all things then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part	130.7258
be assured that i am devoted to both these allpowerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinalone of the most illustrious geniuses that france has ever produced	326.3345
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter	248.8642
oh how distinctly i remember that kissit was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead	174.1701
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line	403.2170
nothing therefore was settled that day as emerys head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence	754.2672
they both stood in amazement at the door	9.5534
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queens letter short but explicit gave him the clue	146.5436
danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs	398.2774
de morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation i am ready my son said mercédès	118.0239
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter the answer to madames replied kitty all in a tremble	262.2698
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a goodnatured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort	148.2445
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of aramis monsieur dartagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale	58.3537
our bark flew before the wind	666.2221
our readers already know how he was recognized by dartagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey	270.8003
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man	45.4543
penelon nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he recovered	520.4330
it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin	173.2483
you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead	69.4064
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve oh oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me dartagnan bah perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos	199.8652
but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address oh my god i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands yes yes madame you must and i will save them all but how	130.6757
deserted she repeated ah yes i am indeed deserted you are right sir and no one can doubt my position these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray	365.0225
this feeling lasted but for a moment	34.1063
the four old friends prepare to meet again	118.3426
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course but no one thought of monte cristo	295.6083
i am getting more and more seasick go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet	1082.8688
a newly born infant repeated debray this affair becomes serious well said châteaurenaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters	286.4625
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	107.4054
m he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocketbook and both began for the third time to count their gold and banknotes	156.3855
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken checkstring which was fastened to alis finger	341.5675
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurators wife and not to say a word of the wound thats agreed you have my word oh he would kill me dont be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he appears saying these words dartagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interestedhis debt and his life	119.2339
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dantès you make me shudder	201.9941
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	444.8348
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother	188.5602
you say you desire my mothers good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent m do you think so said monte cristo with interest	104.0888
dartagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword	98.9654
only i warn you that when i reside in a country i conform to all its code and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake oh do not do that excellency i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair	163.3449
but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds	374.3272
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect	172.1435
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am mme	124.4665
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle very well said dartagnan his eyes aflame battle it is a long time since we have had a battle eh porthos battle cried porthos	295.5744
what are you doing you have wounded me to the heart never mind it for i see you once more said the old man and now its all overeverything is all right again m yes here i am said the young man with a promising future and a little money	140.4214
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly	291.6006
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves listen to monsieur de tréville said the king listen to him would not one say he was speaking of a religious community	120.2834
did the romans eat them said the gardenerate dormice i have read so in petronius said the count	377.5197
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated	2447.7480
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity	467.1123
my faith i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about	782.7043
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy	74.8374
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution	407.2354
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village _armentières_ read porthos armentières	467.7484
stop i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	255.1259
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france	130.8720
indemnity you agree to indemnify and hold the foundation the trademark owner any agent or employee of the foundation anyone providing copies of project gutenberg electronic works in accordance with this agreement and any volunteers associated with the production promotion and distribution of project gutenberg electronic works harmless from all liability costs and expenses including legal fees that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur a distribution of this or any project gutenberg work b alteration modification or additions or deletions to any project gutenberg work and c any defect you cause	202.7787
they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room	206.6167
dartagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently	221.4299
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter	425.8563
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and reenter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra	886.3812
gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows	137.7877
what is the matter then he asked	64.0636
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction there was a stream close by and a bridge across it	170.9079
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations	2544.2432
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolfs or jackals	461.0070
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france	191.4901
i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court	326.1069
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one scruplethat of leaving my dear grandmothers remains which i had undertaken to watch valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred yes said valentine besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m	177.3759
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched is it then so terrible a poison oh no in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies what then is it a skilful preparation of my friends the worthy abbé adelmonte who taught me the use of it oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable antispasmodic perfect madame as you have seen replied the count and i frequently make use of itwith all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence	260.8387
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme	138.7609
renée regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover	331.2487
they entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder	302.7978
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable	84.0878
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably	425.8949
my friend said he here is a proof of it m albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	211.5916
take her six bottles of different winecyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters get them at borels and be sure you say they are for me at what oclock sir do you breakfast m what time is it now a quarter to ten very well at half past ten	309.1954
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve oclock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the _pharaon_ and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion	221.5276
de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police exactly sir one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing	122.3015
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane	280.3362
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majestys voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel	141.2341
the next morning when kitty presented herself at dartagnans she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death	270.9431
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne	285.3518
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m	84.8286
except your signature and your partners m	4834.3936
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	155.3287
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the bankers family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars	156.8874
well yes pretty well replied dartagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere yes that is inevitable said porthos	269.8381
hey said the cardinal opening the door	8.6705
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm	179.7287
ah _pardieu_ is that you said porthos to dartagnan	55.2553
leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment do you know the mediterranean i have sailed over it since my childhood you know the best harbors there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage to dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us if he says true said the captain doubtingly	265.6524
davrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door	131.7994
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m	136.6246
she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus she made him a sign to dismount and come to her	82.3741
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen	184.0633
explain yourself more clearly i beg sir oh make yourself easyi am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean	342.8149
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils	303.9746
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered my poor girl you know him already i know him yes it was he who saved the life of your stepmother and her son the count of monte cristo the same ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine the friend of madame de villefort it cannot be surely valentine you are mistaken no indeed i am not for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited	102.2755
m maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtiers eyes seemed to sayquicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentines	279.8272
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry	137.5406
morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere	168.5811
do you know her milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid	132.5007
for a long time a gun had been the young mans greatest ambition	193.5994
caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse	285.9267
is it not a joke said danglars	52.3524
it was a quarter past midday	45661.4023
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoledyou the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously	430.3544
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him	91.5619
lord de winter was not at home and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening	86.8267
from two oclock till five franz and albert followed in the _fête_ exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight	414.3828
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything	150.6456
may i at least return asked morrel	201.4721
at this moment a horse neighed	88853.0469
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more	643.6527
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master	300.1095
open the door cried the host open it instantly sir monk no reply	616.1359
indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates me oh dont be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind	286.4626
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape dartagnan appeared to authorize the issue	253.1434
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m	193.0500
my head feels actually cold said porthos	39.9164
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him	153.5391
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy	362.9171
danglars not at all let us recall the exact facts	204.7442
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil	621.6522

athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached	236.9031
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination what is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand	91.4849

and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred no my dear vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them m gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome franz and albert bowed	166.9366
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other sidewhat do you see	255.3675
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and dartagnan turned to him	102.2725
for added he the future cannot fail to mend i inevitably look for better times	2252.6196

i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m	94.3840
bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and curiosity	2213.3457
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	126.8371
meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly alas resistance was far from my thoughts	261.0637

yes sir replied julie with hesitation what is your pleasure	211.0458
with regard to dartagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet	153.7840
the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid curiosity	133.6233
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the dukes tone toward hernow that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine have you enemies then asked richelieu	170.0931
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him	128.2506
we will wait for these gentlemen so please you i have plenty of time and it will be more correct	93.1609
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined	568.0565
follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance	273.5481
yes replied the man but at what a price listen friend said monte cristo	117.8698
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume	278.8094
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemys numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army	115.8003
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars	342.6990
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	277.9760
i like men of head and heart	211.1276
remember raoul this if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great	1156.1196
then i must go to the rue st honoré in order to purchase some rouge for madame de chevreuse	141.1835
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him	77.3070
winters regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp	435.3907
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception	144.7456
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated	224.7087
come this way gentlemen come m	253.0192
with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths	509.9557
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the fortyeight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape	160.0243
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pashas misfortunes who then urged you to write	194.9422
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis	193.7792
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain	101.6872
the white flag _morbleu_ we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasures sake	206.1190
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm	401.6114
draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands	231.3475
but dartagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos	404.0485
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune	76.4434
i consent on condition that la ramee tries them with me	299.2618
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there oh cried the duchess i cannot make war alone but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favoriteon the honor of a duchess i will avenge myself madame replied athos do not injure the vicomte de bragelonnedo not ruin his prospects	235.8094
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned	343.2516
on the st morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things	239.2445
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth	236.5917
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in	49.8413
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you ali bowed in token of strict obedience	214.6577
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey	101.4561
at each crosspath was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased	800.5293
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you but no said valentineno i tell you it is all past and it was nothing	99.6629
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven oclock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission	145.1773
drink a glass of port said aramis it will refresh you yes let us drink said athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with dartagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country	164.4408

very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud willingly said aramis	135.1812
sir said he to the priest i shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment	130.9361
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat oh this is what i feared said morrel	129.9222
de tréville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court	109.8068
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance	196.1351
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else	51.6439
you are abused sir but that is not the question	44.0218
will there be any mass asked one of the attendants	136.2312
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arminarm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death	405.1411
i will say then _monsieur_ quite short you may even say _my lord_ replied athos who stickled for propriety	1623.5450
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it	445.1217
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majestys service in whatever way you may see fit to use me the abbé dherblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii of whom i have spoken to you madame then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service	153.4040
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurators wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water but that must be a princess at leastthat lady with her negro boy and her maid my god madame you are deceived said porthos she is simply a duchess and that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman mme	171.2637
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor davrigny	230.2037
but i am not yet ready to receive it very well	92.0013
he had passed the night standing and without sleep	388.0849
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in	121.0772
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city	150.1696
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him	420.1284
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing	148.7181
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano	214.3621
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen	105.4999
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman	184.7565
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game	283.4490
dartagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy	120.6709
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other	317.8259
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crownswhich however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his _protégé_ monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville	139.8381
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer	168.7190
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the united states	882.9406
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest	271.1021
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of you are right aramis let us travel on to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible	120.7114
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarins niece	588.3156
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions	499.6013
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countesss suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason	367.3259
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting	121.7671
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée dantin no the others are on the mantlepiece of your excellencys bedroom good what oclock is it four oclock monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerfs and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way	150.5158
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin thats all very well replied dartagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh	149.9622
they drew near to the sloop	19853.1543
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni	121.1367
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel down with mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten	430.5687
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saintméran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentines mother	434.1835
and pray what do you call such an action but who said it was buried alive why bury it there if it were dead	346.4968
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately	358.3574
de tréville generally held so sacred became in an instant the annex of the antechamber	205.5838
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders	134.3673
you whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by henrietta whatever news you bring speak out sire cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle ah exclaimed the king to fight no sire but to buy your majesty what did you say i said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army for unpaid wages yes i know it	213.4349
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	141.0794
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length	64.7127
he approached the wall and tried to climb it but the wall had been recently pointed and dartagnan could get no hold	219.8702
as to dartagnan he did not budge from his apartment	264.5139
remained alone and turning his eyes on his halfopened horace muttered _justum et tenacem propositi virum_ m	6661.3228
do you wish to see the powderroom no when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by them never fear theres ten oclock striking at greenwich groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich	370.2237
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not yes and it was they who told you something which made you angry	133.2930
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling	22.4449
can i be of service to your majesty said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity	92.2091
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercers wife he did not forget his friends	169.4129
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on	59.8326
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards	120.8725
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with châteaurenaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation	89.9820
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition	171.4580
dartagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul	274.8832
dantès hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together	206.9538
forward cried dartagnan and spur for your dear lives they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward scotland	222.8673
i am a sailor not a second was to be lost	90.0822
an instant after porthos and aramis reentered the surgeon and m	134.2393
at nine oclock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse	222.2396
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it but you will not make me your confidant maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret	89.1052
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven oclock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you	655.7007
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment	415.8521
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars	248.7161
absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between edmond and mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone m yes but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and ones name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that muttered fernand	284.2905
in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinals will	79.4154
what did your excellency say inquired the other	109.7035
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	260.4503
you are insane monsieur monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting and dartagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to dartagnan to serve him as a safeguard	114.2305
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell	113.9802
m and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him her looks her eyes her smile were all for morrel	225.7145
ah thats it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony we are going to fetch our brevets said dartagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them and where are we going asked porthos	160.4454
if it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good pieces manage the matter as well as you can my good man it does not concern me the more so as i have not a livre left come said dartagnan let us inquire further	143.7077
in a moment they were at the canebière	632.6243
benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains	988.2343
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his lifethat of standing behind a gilded carriage	170.2926
it is war said the prince	126.0507
dartagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses	2946.7148
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddlebags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes	179.6896
then with a sigh poor haydée murmured he	252.6718
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was over can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	170.1477
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea	58.7596
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind	402.4746
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him	38.0440
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham	502.3432
truly she might have thought of you at home i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her touching sympathy so you hate each other said the count	91.6929
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	221.8580
the women had already fled taking refuge in vitry only a few men remained	528.1851
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work	213.5232
you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here	87.2594
de tréville alone remaining with the wounded	58.9448
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment	77.1221
die cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk	514.2692
what a confounded country this england is this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal what do you think dartagnan asked athos	93.4338
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations	229.5604
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said dartagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied dartagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead did you not say she was dead three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved	159.4003
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat	198.3576
the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth	979.4498
no madame they struck me always struck me m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush	279.0887
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries	1362.6803
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled has he eaten anything lately asked madame de villefort eluding her husbands question	232.4684
we have made a wagera wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause	174.7267
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way	349.2536
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing	953.6514
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession	317.0296
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because i am only twenty the young woman looked at him furtively	130.4717
de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor	277.1554
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blockedreverend sir i dont knowbelieve mei take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forcedit is tolerably evident caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape	534.1577
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards	303.2178
by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant dantès saw a fishingboat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves	379.1558
athos examined it and became very pale	157.4817
she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pontneuf	235.0775
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer	265.5000
laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a run	315.5818
no pardon my frankness too my lord i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence you make me young and happy again by it	135.2087

he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife	103.2769

ah by heaven it is god himself who sent us here yes said porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him no replied dartagnan no noise	114.8581

the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney	1074.2369
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you dartagnan became more and more astonished	214.6510
the queen rest assured we shall not see her and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal immediately	42.2440

there were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated	487.7975
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped	112.3381
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end	190.0276
_ecco_ said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him	128.8410
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental dartagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance	480.6411
but what has happened then since last evening count the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi i have seen a ghost and that ghost told me morrel that i had lived long enough maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other	240.3931

i wish to consult you on this passage _molli fugiens anhelitu_ you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf	1257.4622
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rosecolored satin	294.6611
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced	122.9937
i find england a charming country and i staybut on one condition only what is it that i am not forced to learn english well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears usi believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again so be it said dartagnan but ii confess i have a contrary conviction our good dartagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye but in the meantime saves the country added athos	317.6700
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent	399.4501
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sublieutenant stood before her	141.0026

not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great streetdoor which alone afforded the means of egress	157.8222
what an idea i who am going to give you another piece of good advice what is it to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger	86.4211

dartagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face	39.0707
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the diningroom or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn	255.0146
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him	123.6612
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter	322.8157
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests	235.8287
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel	58.4010
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness	1595.2754
on his part the king returned to his apartment	86.1982
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden	209.0128
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict	657.2612

do not seek to know how i discovered it i know itthat is sufficient	295.1185
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussels threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag	675.0544
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franchecomte	1000.6354
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow	192.0485
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse	720.6908
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake	131.4090
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation	568.9092
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the actthen one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh	436.3859
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king	98.2823
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee	170.9799
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends	390.1221
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there	237.7577
but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women	125.1983
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him	150.4966

the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his ridingwhip he opened it immediately	229.6814
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously	172.1718
well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and tonight they have sold you for two hundred thousand poundsthat is to say for half what is owing them impossible cried the king the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain lord leven are you certain of it sir i heard it with my own ears the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands	191.6458
no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the word and who thus designated it the king himself the king i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics	186.5038
well here i am be satisfied	245.8011
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you	85.1582
i have no enmity against m	195.1733
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately	310.8387

smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and customhouse officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	235.0114

as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier	82.0104
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners sir replied dartagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks	413.5744

the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others	229.5744
haydée had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier	337.7446
in the antechamber upon long circular benches reposed the elect that is to say those who were called	356.1281
dartagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket	134.8970
monsieur dartagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach m	225.0257
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her sons ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss	219.9575
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry	170.9435
well asked anne of austria when dartagnan reappeared what does it mean it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left dartagnan saw from the expression of the queens face that she was about to issue some violent command	97.3591
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	2221.3462

de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man	86.1232
now then she said what next madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony	98.6297
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword	256.3335
ah you lose ground you are turning	87.6385
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage	136.5697
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m	279.3248
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic	157.0088
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_ and he was recognized	168.0213
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days	694.9109
the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked bertuccio	168.3582
monsieur mordaunt tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from aramis so there is said dartagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying dartagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge	153.7021
in one hour after the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with letters	868.4921
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan	170.9577
i tell you so by the faith of de tréville how so you will be assassinated and i shall die in the performance of my duty but your mission will not be accomplished that is true replied dartagnan	65.2533

the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either farias or dantès cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain	443.6740
and i know i shall drown before reaching it continued blaisois	1178.0358
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news	36.1399
franz dépinay yes franz astonished advanced a step	1037.8141
you see said lord de winter presenting dartagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman	133.4818
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army	355.4073
they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious	683.3926
do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us	204.3305
grief has consumed her said villefortyes grief doctor after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement	265.7285
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine oclock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis	102.4363
noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to dieit is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward	274.1358
caderousse quickly performed the strangers bidding and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off the name of edmonds betrothed was mercédès to be sure	266.7287
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy and died that must have cut short the projects of escape for the dead man yes replied m	259.7050
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friendspoor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind	324.1886
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	53.5806
that was what he could not know	28.0814
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing	202.1788
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow be it so said beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately	153.0626
you were in the south of france i think yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france a carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pontdebeauvoisin and from pontdebeauvoisin to paris m indeed	276.7197
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kings authority	64.1621
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of dartagnan cruelly mystified him	141.5411
at your service sir said planchet overwhelmed with joy if i were still capable of serving you perhaps so replied dartagnan	176.0520
shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess	114.5706
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions	1474.2126
one drop will restore life as you have seen five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor	250.5278
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars	148.1193
nonsense impossible said châteaurenaud only ten days after the flight of her daughter and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband debray colored slightly and followed with his eyes the direction of beauchamps glance	189.6971
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves	1294.8370
what an idea where is the letter you speak of	41.4887
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her	186.2188
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way	256.4353
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps	97.7706
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion	355.4676
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy	425.1001
d february this is capital said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we cannotwe must push on they rode forward and reached abbeville	471.8758
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated	266.4375
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life	184.2740
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor	199.9721
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound has he been wounded then oh good lord what have i said you said that porthos had received a sword cut yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so and why so zounds monsieur because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back	169.4032
i told you so athos said dartagnan shrugging his shoulders	20.0037
i want to know what crime i have committedto be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector	163.8785
another had done all this why then was it impossible to dantès	140.3834
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their salutation	328.9487
i shall follow the counts directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out	147.4729
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar sausages athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person	230.1731
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan	163.3474
without that what would become of me it was one oclock in the morning	56.1830
let us rather kill them yes kill them cried dartagnan i see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening	191.4133
no replied athos with a singular smile	246.5610
dartagnan ran out and returned directly after	1720.4205
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them and you were wrong madame	124.5616
each was anxious to gain admission before the other	247.9137
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover	597.8217
dartagnan who was by nature very curiousas people generally are who possess the genius of intriguedid all he could to make out who athos porthos and aramis really were for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family nameathos in particular who a league away savored of nobility	570.5104
this evening your destiny begins to change amen exclaimed dartagnan stopping the carriage	243.3499
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol	63.3778
but dartagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it	84.8631
the four old friends prepare to meet again	118.3426
the abovementioned purchase was made on his highnesss account whose mandate i had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs	160.6649
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn yes monseigneur	129.5325
a bad joke of the husbands substituted the other but the husband has been punished since and i have obtained full satisfaction planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds	370.1606
you are included in the conscription fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms	473.1170

will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client	134.9003
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench he cried	147.8469
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities	1968.5227
yes sire in solitary confinement in a dungeon like the lowest criminal the devil murmured the king what must be done sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal	143.4830
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	261.6886
_ma foi_ i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellowcreatures	354.9017
the sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy font	178.4795
the masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors	149.0079
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady	754.6777
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment	195.6984
both entered and found themselves in darkness but mme	218.4954
he glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement	1540.1849
what must come is written monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening quite the contrary planchet the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy then that is monsieurs determination undeniably my friend	275.0208

and why did you refuse my son inquired the old man	44.7333
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil to my offer of liberty he replied that it was nothing but a snare and that before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions	100.7356
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dantès knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor	189.6054
for his death the death of your prince yes how so because he has made his will in my favor indeed on my honor for how much for five hundred thousand only that	110.3137
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugénie what does that signify so long as they favor your suit but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary	114.0328
athos was the last to enter	388.3579
is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago certainly not longer well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week	227.9095
except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career gérard de villefort was as happy as a man could be	155.2810
at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insectactors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string m and are you going there i am what telegraph do you intend visiting	435.2855
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared	115.9713
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs	76.0964
shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensuedthe silence of death which was allpervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès	341.6294
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another	483.7511
they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty what do you fear vasiliki said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud	212.5688

now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry	557.3841
i cannot consent that this woman should die thus milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope	199.6562
de tréville had the right of entry at all times	268.6385
villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kings attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said châteaurenaud dr davrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it	358.8550
are you not he asked the priest who here in the château dif is generally thought to beill mad you mean dont you i did not like to say so answered dantès smiling	177.2306
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerfs adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known	316.9229
glad he cried i should be more than glad happybeyond measure well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health dartagnan almost leaped with joy	252.1125
no said she withdrawing it gentlyno my friend touch me not	1029.6930
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but youll die of hunger said the patron	262.4414
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own	254.2567
no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected	1439.9039
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him	192.7316
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon	299.9319
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation	215.4959
then dartagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knowsdartagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant	216.3851
danglars dined here yes with count cavalcanti the marquis his father madame danglars m	309.3774
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard	351.6164
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and dartagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written	111.6510
he pointed his finger to the lighted window	174.7888
come in gentlemen come in called dartagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party	98.2807
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death edmond still heard the sound	203.3482
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne	914.1809
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back	150.4820
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are a fallen prince exclaimed mazarin piteously	274.5252
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourselfwhom he considered the first three personages in france dartagnan added m	286.9808
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man	146.3550
the footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand dantès guessed that the two gravediggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the handbier	426.6903
_pardieu_ resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman i have said what i have said and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied dartagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air	78.2094
but to return to our millions certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world	125.0464
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor	493.9049
he knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments but whence did these impediments arise	336.6942
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart	185.1441
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrinis hotel	324.6952
well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular see sir replied caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy woodhere on this shelf is my wifes testament open this book and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix	204.0520
he brought me up as if i had been his son and in he married	76.1935
go away now mouston so hes called mouston thought dartagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about	406.6391
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity and he remained again motionless and thoughtful	178.0285
the queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to valdegrace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her	227.5308
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil	139.7154
ah ah but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos	267.1256
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villeforts coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him	148.6903
you appear to be a brave young man besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen	92.2837
he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to comedeeds and power which none could thwart with impunity	637.6426
look at me well in your turn	82.1918
i should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice	277.2176
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told raoul bowed	98.8000
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper	191.0231
i wished to live said athos	20.0921
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the kings musketeers in these quarrels	232.9954
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it	239.7176
then steer for monte cristo the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island	116.1619
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet	149.9838
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream the jeweller smiled	160.1747
your fellowcountryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican	126.2072
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces	259.7356
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead	151.8014
dartagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage	105.6052
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end	309.4763
where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i dont know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby	130.3768
porthos looked at dartagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companions gascon sharpness continually supplied him	862.6650
have you proof of this i had it and you have lost it how stupid yes but by careful search it might be recovered really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me and the count humming an air from _lucia_ went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts	223.6570
what fault do you find with the fellow he is a glutton oh sir cried olivain reappearing at this accusation	401.8391
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old mans madness	134.6005
he is a man of from fifty to fiftytwo years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache	486.2305
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him	385.4928
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here	143.9399
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you knowa cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesnt sympathize with the desires of others	370.6356
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort	228.2163
there was no peculiar indication in any organan excitement of the nervous systemthat was it a case of cerebral congestionnothing more	1071.8301
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper yes sir for all ive had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it	215.6970
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew	57.9232
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step	276.6141
well you said porthos what then i cannot wait oh as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young mans eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself	155.3360

that cousin of aramis that marie michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend and the queenproud as she is in her double character as austrian and as spaniardcalled her her sister alas said madame de chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed and the queen had reason for her affection for marie was devoted to herdevoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother the king of spain which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime and therefore continued athos the cardinalthe true cardinal the other onedetermined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches	302.8256
i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate i did so for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger	82.6537
i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged ah so much the better exclaimed the king	254.7992
still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was well ah now i think of it the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the hall said beauchamp	63.7453
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair	84.1375
but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king the queen remained silent	106.3737
i am commandant of the port	1624.3287
why is that gendarme there asked andrea of himself	163.5838

egad yes but why dont you come there also athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here	149.6724

de la trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner	151.9846
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when dartagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing dartagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness	150.8306
de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history	190.4868
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance	255.7512
listen he said today is the th of september is it not yes today then at eleven oclock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay yes we know that well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house what will happen then why if today before eleven oclock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve oclock to declare himself a bankrupt oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man	117.8645
not before me behind me but with what asked the duke	65.3388
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves	136.0641
are we not two despairing creatures	2093.2437
thats what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio	198.6556
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you thats well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him	85.3663
in half an hour the young man bowed	38.5652
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the willothewisps that play about the marshes	493.3383
dartagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the chateau du vallon	261.2085
i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday did you fear that we should forget it you are very good madame but m	84.3882
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans	175.4868
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the disputea proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse	130.4604
several times lord de winter porthos or aramis tried to talk with the man in the red cloak but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response	148.2972
the day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise	841.7377
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of bloodit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart	295.4475
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette	274.1339
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection and how many hours of reflection do you ask twelve hours sir is it too long it is now noon at midnight i will be at your house if i should not be in wait for me good at midnight my lord at midnight my dear monsieur louvieres when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house	122.1330
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but wewe shall remain i have a presentiment that we shall yes replied dartagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battlestandard that famous napkin of the bastion st gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleursdelis embroidered be it so cried aramis	354.9491
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed	637.1566
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness	352.9968
we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four men yes but to yield said porthos	92.2569
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds	183.1465
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened	301.6758
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful	165.4452
our recruits from béarn are not generally very rich and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province	160.6726
short and stout who is it they all asked together in a low tone	191.8079
by my soul said aramis she is charming	269.1534
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend the fair indian approached scarron	248.4760
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of m	204.5304
the moment that dartagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity	136.2622
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done	115.6825
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice you are a born diplomat returned franz go and try meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire	368.4483
she should certainly return from her exileshe did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last	268.1239
after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet	252.8317
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated	223.4881
come come continued darminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast	418.5974
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse	559.0359
this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not nearly so well monsieur do you know who this great lady is no i have heard porthos speak of her thats all do you know who this pretended duchess is	99.3097

i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary there has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise	119.8839
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	472.3803
what is this said aramis on seeing them arrive	349.0037
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine paintingbrush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen	200.6001
devil take these civil wars one can no more now reckon on ones friends than on ones footmen said porthos	470.3052
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the _pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor	150.9884
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects	473.3914
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common wants	275.8354
in the meantime dartagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached st cloud but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named	186.3031
i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information what day do you fix asked the president	184.4523

her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came	365.1937
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairyscene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cristo	165.0980
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention	707.0349
did i tell you that i wouldnt serve any other	291.4235
except that which i ask of you dear love but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness i cannot wait till tomorrow silence i hear my brother	116.4985

all his funds amounted to or francs his bills receivable up to the th to or which making the best of everything gave him francs to meet debts amounting to francs	480.3384
most probably morrel and châteaurenaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in wellturned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in wellwritten pieces but it was not the case with debray	201.2507
_one_ said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death	256.4600
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château dif were interred in an ordinary burialground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman	192.3029
formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable	710.7196
through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressingroom the count could see into the street	69.6727
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formedit was none of these things that attracted the attentionit was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdainthese were what fixed the attention of all upon him	436.8006
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assemblyroom	156.9510

say there is no need why dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he should	249.4395
personally i do not know you this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through	229.6274
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully	212.9048

it would be no doubt _parbleu_ if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos	211.6169
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès you have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs i said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i cant keep on my legs	132.6924

the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering	58.2729

besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france	145.0782
her pose which i must admit was rather free wounded this officer	794.0488
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee	266.5748
i implored heaven that he might come	128.9314
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes	447.4621
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept	158.3846
what is he contriving asked aramis	34.7692
if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur yes seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tréville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn without doubt and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes you have already given me that reason and i find it excellent reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you about rent very kind and adding to this if there be need of it meaning to offer you fifty pistoles if against all probability you should be short at the present moment admirable you are rich then my dear monsieur bonacieux i am comfortably off monsieur thats all i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator jean moquet so that you understand monsieurbut cried the citizen	198.3399
the foundations ein or federal tax identification number is	559.7103
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	229.0325
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart	150.4207
oh i will be a match for you murmured milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monks frock by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite	254.0061

its nothing its nothing said milady	77.1149
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance	205.5594
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos	59.3268
villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleons return	336.4352
in fact of the twenty rosetrees which formed the _parterre_ not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	1285.0117
the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose	752.0134
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection	1082.0667
this was the room appropriated to the sailors	24.8261
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever	369.9145
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her	690.2544
thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying hes too ugly m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed	269.5994
we are not such devils as we appear to be	44.2378
holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet	326.1015

dartagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad	291.9270

then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required athos would no more give him his handathos would renounce him	195.4349
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone	121.0482

it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristos name announced	234.4646
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive you think then that i may rely on the counts promises certainly i do you are sure he will keep his word with me to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts	91.2485
then he is not dead m no you see plainly he is not dead	86.2772
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking	153.6152
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering	531.1452
but he will make it up in you i am sure	63.9240
dartagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent	435.7253
well my dear porthos said dartagnan thats the very thing it came into my head to do athos understood all now	120.0953

if he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost	462.3991
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon	287.5725
however he like cæsar borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard	155.9132
then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydée is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes because my lord said haydée eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to knowhow she had become the slave of the count	212.3209
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude	269.7802
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have donei inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	189.6952
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saintméran oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure	127.6345
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemys entire army	303.5169
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless	492.9858
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner	115.3705
at this moment a patrol passed by	113.1072
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner	71.5187
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso	210.4618

eh rascal said dartagnan do you not recognize his highness the princes carriage prince or not said the man open	157.1179
it is no use said the old man there is no wine what no wine said dantès turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards	140.7303
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him	147.2134
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo	59.4513
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens	220.7124
goodday to you have you slept well excellently athos but what are you looking for	309.2889
do you promise i swear to you i will it is well	19.0947
i should be too happy to be of any service to her	63.1884
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister	78.3366
fortunately as we have said edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women the wound soon closed	549.5628
she tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality	427.3840
then you shall not leave this place said he	58.6727
villefort also rang his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate	187.9616
it might be called a magnificent prison	1148.9822
he answered therefore i think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentlemanhe pointed to aramishad also something to tell me when i was in his convent	146.5752

although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the _thousand and one nights_	405.2921
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door	228.7197
de trévilles stablesone for himself dartagnan and one for planchetand bring them to athoss place	482.1681
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching	217.6516
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well	1794.6635
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together till tomorrow then said aramis for ironnerved as you are you must need repose the next morning when dartagnan entered aramiss chamber he found him at the window	187.0206
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée	165.8190
de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned	74.9905

madame de lannoy whom according to your majestys command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day thats it cried the king to him no doubt	143.5169

if his excellency will recollectif he will think ah true observed monte cristo i recollect now	170.5737
he had entered villeforts office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand	95.3446
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone	59.8970

morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all	100.8877

what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it	110.1760
i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal but woe to those who stood in my pathway m enough said mercédès enough edmond believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures	201.2052
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight oclock in the evening you are not here no moneyeven if it be but five minutes past eight then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	149.9006
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	182.1565
what interest have they in your death	231.6330

he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches	402.4994
who is in command here asked the cardinal	23.8488
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole	135.0730
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that dartagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queens letter and for which he had repaid m	132.0502
they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers brave young man murmured the king	122.2613
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost madwhat will not reality do but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you which asked the young man	196.9142

planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues	204.0320
mon dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog does he hate his majesty as much as he does us pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property true said aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him	183.4126
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us go away from here said dartagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood rascal eh monsieur said dartagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat do you hear well well rejoined the leader theres no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for	163.5142

well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth	250.0327
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once	215.0656
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine	284.8598
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries well well nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable poor count and is he aware of the danger he has been in i think not then it will be but charitable to inform him	149.3393

now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever	197.6309
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not certainly said morrel i am at your service count still what it is desirable i should know the real cause that is to say you would rather not no the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side enough said morrel who is your second witness i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel	134.1969

i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutteryes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to dartagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn	163.0062

ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moments silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation why in truth sir was monte cristos reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do	329.5667
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty	205.9988
i want to learn everything said the abbé	19.1183
it is six oclock said madame de villefort evidently agitated	93.0979
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court	178.8233
there is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas	274.6766
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel morrel	140.7594
good to eat he said and put it in his pocket	74.0134
morrel understood it he knew he must call assistance	420.6355
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly	156.2906
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord	137.3999
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you havent the heart to kill me no not if thou dost not oppose my flight but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place you are determined to leave the chateau by heaven and earth this night i am determined to be free and if i defend myself or call or cry out i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman at this moment the clock struck	101.4413
you are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered	96.9809
thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m	236.6657
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for but why did it not kill my father i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saintmérans deathbecause his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m	161.3977
well i will amuse you how by introducing to you a new acquaintance a man or a woman a man i know so many men already but you do not know this man where does he come fromthe end of the world farther still perhaps the deuce i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him oh no our breakfast comes from my fathers kitchen	170.6352
you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the château dif you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger can it be cried mercédès shuddering	103.9982
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud	593.2692
yes monsieur said dartagnan bowing we have had that honor	110.5490
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé	209.4335
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees	244.1688
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual	281.3812
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller	178.9445
is he a shepherd or a noblemanyoung or oldtall or short	2294.5876
i cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rivals attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernandhe was ghastly pale	285.6176
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened	258.4925
what dreadful sufferings said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother	552.9315
albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the counts kindness	511.6605
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable	220.2151
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to be	66.2285
dartagnan remember this my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine	119.3875
porthos opened his mouth to reply dartagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	249.9660
only take care that i am not seen through the wicket oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied milady	100.3895
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one its true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist	247.9921
god has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life	100.8819
i begin and without any rhetoric allow me porthos said aramis	497.1631
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window	248.7717
the devil cried the host at his wits end	972.9753
i am not obliged to read any breviary	2313.3022
but i repeat to you i am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen	106.4409
the company looked at each other in consternation	261.2063
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps	234.0846
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room	130.1692
franz dépinay an expression of intense joy illumined the old mans eyes	346.0179
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters	177.1213
once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest to horse said lord winter	162.6773
as dartagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m	146.5192
you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to remain on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go	106.5059
alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy	313.2603
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal	175.8368
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friendnot here at least	312.9091
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey	144.5569
bravo cried dartagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis	2657.3701
_my dear cousin_ ah ah said athos	6.7448
well then gowait for me there and i will soon join you you leave me then yes i also have a pious visit to pay morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city	111.6523
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven	104.6331
the english repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie were obliged to reembark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to paris by claude de st simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame	427.3412
i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end said the stranger	125.0508
at the sight of papers of all sortstitles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i foundnothing	511.4920
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	290.3952
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them	225.0142
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the halfkindness halfcruelty with which his host related the brief narrative	249.7229
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible then m	391.2688
in truth i was fated said she	49.6741
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless	211.5628
no but we are going to replied dartagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground	96.6279
lord de winter perceived nothing of this	23.8789
aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme	116.1868
goodbye said châteaurenaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right	169.8156
he felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did return	1597.0564
_diable_ he said after having swallowed the divine preserve	733.0527
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse	195.3787
i as a philosopher should like a little countryhouse a cottage down there under the trees without so many freestones over my poor body	489.0505
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded	100.8533
this promise completed poor kittys consolation	3964.0474
i dont like mazarin any better than you do	74.4808
here is monsieur comminges said dartagnan returning to the cardinal	29.6791
do you then love mercédès i adore her for long as long as i have known heralways and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition i did not think that was the way of your people what would you have me do said fernand	164.6543
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felons life might live as other men	197.2350
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young mans road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey	154.0689
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die	142.0002
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him	68.7648
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person and who is this third person monsieur le prince he has come then as they told me last evening and you have seen him he has just left me and will he aid this project the plan is his own and paris he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion the plan is not wanting in grandeur i see but one impediment what is it impossibility a senseless word	195.5102
you are the directors of all consciences	6987.0674
well here are francs on account the majors eyes sparkled brilliantly	3391.3894
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door	295.6134
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention	403.6479
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i dont believe in them the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemenan affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained how is that cried porthos and aramis in a breath	269.5006
what then how much do you require for my ransom merely the you have about you danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart	265.5985
is monsieur dartagnan there yes madame in your oratory	306.5693
order my lord he said i am ready to obey your eminence monsieur dartagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor	233.2104
charles perceived it and took his hand	24.5272
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later	242.5568
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	93.1745
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them	125.8272
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring the goldsmith knew the duke	216.0017
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl	10.9639
and then said madame de villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of god	264.1267
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time sit down said the old man	87.5123
de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentineor still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp	347.0460
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weatherbeaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within	498.4855
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance	650.2701
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated	1277.6171
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled	154.0818
now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink for twenty years i have tasted nothing but water the man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces	119.5908
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now wellnigh if not quite corrupt	282.0366
what do you want monsieur demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to dartagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures	133.2182
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done me no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england then you dont know me sir it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me none i swear to you there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured	111.0407
pray was not monsieur dartagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude toguitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak outi know nothing but what the public knows	300.9840
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from goodwill it was now the coadjutors turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres	272.2429
dartagnan alone had discovered nothinghe ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him	222.2707
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter xix	106.1962
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her king henry iv	336.9488
her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion	431.0685
betrayed yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always loved better than the english	156.4729
if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain	128.0609
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second	127.9417
five millionsa pretty sum eh peppino hushhere is our man the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads one was writing and the other praying when the door opened	350.4148
de tréville the guards to that of m	83.5957
here is a letter which must be taken to its address to its address my lord	122.5957
danglars and you caderousse and fernand said caderousse with a chuckle fernand too is invited my wifes brother is my brother said edmond and we mercédès and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word	143.2670
at the end of a quarter of an hour m	26.3722
this is the order he said	18.8571
do you know the decision we have come to mother have we come to any yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercédès sighed	117.8872
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through arras	226.6066
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him	94.3071
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers	235.1138
can it be bad news i fear it i will leave you with this stranger but as soon as he is gone if you will permit me i will return _permit_ you	80.2928
de saintméran madame de saintméran barrois all fall	4529.7402
and that is the only reply you make	307.4707
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening	114.8283
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali a horse for m	349.4077
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	207.2951
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman a gentleman exclaimed athos	74.5736
you think then said he that i am taken to the château dif to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m	126.9850
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired	204.7764
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twentyfive leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model	129.1461
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees	250.0724
de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschilds or lafittes and they will take it off your hands at once what though payable at rome certainly it will only cost you a discount of or francs the receiver started back	390.6944
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you the devil said dartagnan whom the positive tone of m	159.8977
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly well asked dartagnan	233.1776
noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the daggerm	574.2181
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room	126.9869
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me	78.3831
he again ran back to the château	52.1726
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m	58.0134
it was alas the ghost of former greatness	1136.6613
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has mans justice been deceived by those fatal words	734.3832
have they then offered a large one inquired cromwell	625.2603
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring	171.2575
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selims fiery lance	209.1116
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman	341.4375
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood	123.2959
at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings	209.2505
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck	573.4645
i am of a frankness of character quite french rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile	155.3639
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior	136.1100
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchengarden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and dartagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia	239.6889
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door	149.4886
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp châteaurenaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist observed debray	218.3122
and king charles x had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on formed a considerable body	250.4617
when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you	367.5025
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the th february and this is the rd of march no sire but i am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since i left my office go thither and if there be nonewell well continued louis xviii make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously	345.1601
dartagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m	57.1276
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saintméran coffins	191.4365
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending	307.9193
that great man who was so revered by dartagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back	600.4806
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief	360.4018
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared	475.5772
how can we be implicated in any way	79.7682
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of dartagnan	160.7378
therefore if you part with m	331.0852
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe	97.4574
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out	125.0385
dartagnan alone did not seem convinced	10914.0352
and why ah very well said dartagnan i see that you understand french	49.9941
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerfs i will await her return and beg her to come up here	120.8474
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away	85.3528
stop i want to remember his exact words	922.3069
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself	98.7541
what can i say more asked monte cristo	25.5803
you are somewhat _blasé_ i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others	280.4249
this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now representedbroken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughtsbut such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle	297.4655
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franzs curiosity	559.3509
where is the child villefort shrugged his shoulders	49.6809
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock	228.3780
this execution quieted the illdisposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hungerthis death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation	377.8801
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners	98.8729

and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you	128.5937

the elder prisoner pondered the matter	227.5251
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twentyfour hours dartagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility	152.6903

thats well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to porthos and aramis but you dartagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally	69.2705
come calm yourself and reckon them upm	8726.2744
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur dartagnan	50.0943
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel	116.5542
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen	276.4539
dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success	441.1772
that will serve us for a relay said athos	230.8438
bonacieux the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him	65.6313
dartagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by planchet at the same pace	165.4336

monsieur porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five nevertheless said dartagnan the people are bowing very low to this person as he spoke he rode toward the tall horseto the man of importance and his valets	269.1085

imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i dont know how long to the amount of or francs during the year	150.4101

it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least ah thats another thing said dartagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question	115.7849
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court	190.5304
the next two days passed in much the same way	142.1182
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majestys guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a wellfurnished purse in his pocket	112.8115
to cours la reine cried dartagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance	236.9129

mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions	79.1003

she held in her hand a fresh billet from milady	413.1879

the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene	383.3407
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind	187.5567
when i awoke a fresh meal was served	883.8088

he would have spoken but his voice failed him	180.6894
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small casket	60.6547

what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets	987.8818
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation	90.4235
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count	123.1644

oh i cannot behold this frightful spectacle said he	196.6474

it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler	105.1288

noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron dépinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel	185.2630

conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinkingsong	174.2713
you have done thisi hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees	41.2132
he became curious to solve the problem	604.3928
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money	367.6151
maximilian goes with _me_ said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brothers account once more farewell my dear sister emmanuel adieu morrel repeated	273.2196
ah my poor friends murmured dartagnan where are you	27.8683
during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife	189.5923
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again	29.7163
speak then i am all ears dartagnan related his adventure with mme	774.6623
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror	511.7999
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawingroom saw haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back	82.1647
de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king	123.8361
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world you live alone then i do you have no sisterno sonno father i have no one how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life it is not my fault madame	147.5225
you pretend not to knowbecause government was not rich enough ah pardon me said châteaurenaud i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i cannot understand them yet you will by and by said debray	118.7331
the house of thomson french had or francs to pay this month in france and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration	175.6634
all was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless	280.7777
come said andrea you are a man void of compassion ill have you turned out this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh	257.1909
de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them m at the moment when davrigny was returning to valentines room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m	251.1245
i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more	219.7774
the worthy merchant had been more fortunate	965.1725
welladay how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos this cannot be monsieur porthos observed planchet replying as it were to his masters thoughts	162.6710
diplomat or not i dont know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly	146.6462
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for dartagnan to follow him	111.4993
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view	374.3195
the counts tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere	329.6515
and has visited with me that is in	53.8926
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered	175.7623
good i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps	84.7496
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals	362.1831
he is at my house come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us	207.8706
and youfellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte dartagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop	183.1971
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was	103.0903
felton remained behind he held a book in his hand	60.9308
he was not deceived it was she whom he sought	107.6708
in which we hear tidings of aramis	39.6390
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared	94.8158
must i use any password to procure a horse only dismount another will be immediately saddled albert hesitated a moment	400.9391
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to parisso that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed	252.7808
should andrea marry according to his fathers views he will perhaps give him one two or three millions	150.5194
i have then about fifty pistoles	63.9663
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear	159.6999
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broadbrimmed hat	322.4377
morrel i didnt dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old mans being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you how singular murmured maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrarywhat strange feelings are aroused by politics hush cried valentine suddenly someone is coming maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it	204.2240
he was a dead man and on my honor if i had discovered that it was his son i should have regretted having killed him ah sir said raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellows life to thank you on my own account	100.1229
this with my spanish affairs made a pretty end to the month then you really lost by that affair in spain yes only francs out of my cash boxnothing more why how could you make such a mistakesuch an old stager oh it is all my wifes fault	298.0829
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him teteatete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade	83.5212
i have not and i cannot make three copies of that letter because it is sealed	147.1188
dont you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess	133.1829
hold sire said dartagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute	141.4269
the queen looked at him surprised	5873.9116
then remarking the strange expression of miladys countenance she said pardon me madame you know him by what title why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of friend you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress it is you who have been his mistress madame cried milady in her turn	105.4160
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit	228.4302
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered	180.7825
shall we return to the camp said porthos	153.5645
noirtiers grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m	55.7134
oh come come but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase	120.9718
but as you are the strongest after all continued dartagnan dont be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked dartagnan with an eloquent look	301.1746
when i like caderousse was thoughtful for a moment	68.3469
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there yes youre right replied the companion	236.2346
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving englandin case either of failure or of success	541.3441
there only then remained porthos and bicarat	153.3518
i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought dartagnan	112.6670
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of youof our friends and on my part said dartagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything to love you cry fie friends are shadows the world is a sepulcher alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh	134.0884
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language	435.1081
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something	86.5102
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step	114.7154
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly dartagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper	613.3272
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape patience said the abbé in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience caderousse looked at him with amazement	137.7133
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars	731.7329
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	276.1884
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door	72.5532
by whom by the gentleman who was here yesterday	83.4294
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m	148.4066
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy	396.8009
it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her stepmother and that she should be fetched	79.3342
haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier	380.3365
by that plain arrangement of the hair by that costume of extreme simplicity by the brow polished like marble and as hard and impenetrable she recognized one of those gloomy puritans she had so often met not only in the court of king james but in that of the king of france where in spite of the remembrance of the st bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge	211.6281
dartagnan followed him and mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans	195.4359
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears	724.2802
yes keep itkeep it monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect if you repent there is still time no said danglars no decidedly no keep my signatures	230.7588
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell	182.6210
thank you thank you murmured she	76.3811
leave me alone said aramis impatiently	2088.1533
but it has not been so with mei see and always have seen during the last sixteen years	342.2692
baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him	784.7047
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	213.6275
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterdays riot which today is already a rebellion tomorrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely	151.3868
what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor	119.1686
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step	94.2030
all eyes were turned towards this manfor to all except athos he was unknown	404.1520
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privationhe was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness	270.3885
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master	124.1062
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat	111.9855
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle	550.6243
i understand you fernand you would be revenged on him because i do not love you you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk	153.9857
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty anne hesitated	345.3452
noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again	342.5139
the battle of lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed they can gain battles yes the marechal de grammont is right this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them	180.4146
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m	120.8015
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps	496.4249
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle	114.4379
today is the th of august the st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrivesand it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give youtill then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other when he had concluded his speech beauchamp bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the pressroom	227.3018
if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement	166.3681
you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me	212.8481
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed	171.4730
everything was as athos had foreseen	759.9438
poor bruteaccustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia thats why you want to purchase my english horse said debray you think he will bear the cold better you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa you were very much frightened then asked beauchamp	198.3457
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged	126.6610
i dont know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was ratherrather strong in greek he spoke the romaic language did he i think so that settles it murmured franz	375.6268
the fool the ass the idiot how so if he loved her asked dartagnan	158.8814
the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful bernouin a cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm	421.1647
as dartagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer	107.0261
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm but what then they who love believe easily in love	613.2980
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile	319.0316
this is all very easy for you to say replied dartagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resourcesfor me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair	246.1704
the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason	135.9050
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs	559.3330
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms	137.9613
how is it that i have never met you at his house i am no acquaintance of m	75.7028
so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m	171.0984
youll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain come dear dartagnan look up a little courage it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merrygoround wheels and rewards us	294.1798
well where is he sir asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice	223.3334
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de contis lieutenant	113.7041
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and reentered the house	131.1932
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration	140.6583
dépinay no whence then will come the help we needfrom chance resumed morrel	1127.5017
i will call for them today no tomorrow i shall not have time today well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil may i depend on it certainly because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it now see here will that be all	146.0021
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisiansthat is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received	281.3405
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home	283.4947
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches	203.8355
as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor and i replied franz will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin	127.3426
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici never	290.1267
oh mon dieu he said raising his fine eyes to dartagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me he left four days ago said dartagnan	139.0485
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation	336.3643
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dantès entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative	1458.0328
m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse	153.4182
de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on paradehe stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday eveningdo you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers after a moments silence no sir we do not but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow	137.5974
in short she studied everything as a skillful comedian does to whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not accustomed	179.5471
it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map yes sir replied the count i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individualsa physiological study	294.3896
has the queen any further commands for me now asked dartagnan	87.6559
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you	68.5985
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne cried the former musketeer	324.3324
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke danjou his brother	167.0882
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished	224.2445
it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhône but the care according to the boys account that they took to avoid being seen	281.0747
i am no relation of yours you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man	75.4741
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling	489.3034
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from youyour misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you	223.5699
a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the newcomers contemplated him	135.5771
you think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said gondy	278.5119
in the name of heaven my lord cried mme	60.0769
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then the devil said porthos what can we say to mazarin leave that to mei have my plan	134.7670
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view	374.7090
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air	168.7255
well my dear father in the shipwreck of lifefor life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopesi cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	422.3771
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brotherinlaws gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance	474.2195
ah if mousqueton were here theres a fellow who will never desert me so long as you are rich ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us	223.6079
i was mistaken said the host hes not quite dumb	588.9665
debraydo i wish to know himdo i wish to know that he gives advicedo i wish to follow itdo i speculate	539.8268
de baradas by the comte de cramail and by the chevalier de souveray	539.7128
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time	141.7728
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor	87.8902
nothing but one word said dartagnan	9.5267
but to you dartagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend	185.2626
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myselfno indeed you have then a repugnance to your profession so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as i was by justice and law but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of gods creaturessince that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair	183.0303
in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine sand	368.6588
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven oclock we will then terminate this conversation	141.7809
i knight you monsieur le comte then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king	267.3759
dartagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god	170.4837
you will soon know but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent	210.2495
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefortone of the lowliest of the low then mazarin is still mazarin the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen married if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover you surprise me	256.8478
touching unanimity cried dartagnan which well becomes good citizens like us	1103.5291
but when the cardinal added that not only mme	191.0738
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again	185.5904
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward	465.1366
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention	154.6635
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace	161.5883
to the sloop said felton and row quickly the four men bent to their oars but the sea was too high to let them get much hold of it	208.4325
i have a letter to give you from the count from the count murmured the two young people	63.4876
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door	88.0484
yes you were thinking of it and with justice	130.4655
yes shall i call him yes valentine went to the door and called barrois	103.1192
is he not your friend replied the baron negligently	232.6476
de tréville attended the kings gaming table	10420.4941
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the doorkeepers voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	289.9763
the blow was sped by dartagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom	297.7804
she lived in the place royalethen the fashionable quarterat number and he undertook to call and take dartagnan with him in order to introduce him	263.9565
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account	130.7372

there was a moments silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul	254.0742

he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia	454.7065
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when dartagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand	160.6756
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them	278.3505

he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent	59.9863

when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle dartagnan said athos reproachfully	275.1458
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coachhouses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters	250.3658
de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire	139.8557
and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse	223.4831
de morcerf the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality	597.4044

i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling	137.3206
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades	186.3740
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell	178.7640
when dartagnan returned to the palais royal at five oclock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing	131.1040
do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them	192.6917
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish _genet_ and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon	474.6445

they must be enemies he is right said porthos battle	143.3925

debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband	98.0897
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_ who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own	291.6274

he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours	153.0039
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week asked the mercer piqued to the quick	121.0348
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself	122.0946
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living	190.7025
in a court of justice that is called an alibi dartagnan found his advice prudent	478.7668
it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day	575.6878
however that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him	210.8432

so they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was a la fronde bread a la fronde hats a la fronde to say nothing of gloves pockethandkerchiefs and fans but listen at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing a tempest from the fronde did blow today i think twill blow sieur mazarin away insolent wretch cried guitant	637.6359
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieillechapelle and la venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him	236.0331
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy	621.5276
why oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain with spain no answered dartagnan but paris what do you mean cried rochefort	147.7933
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	144.9931
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated	1219.9702
mr jackson said he go instantly to the lord chancellor and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders	125.7758
why yourself to be sure you give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of and who has filled your head with all this nonsense why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchamps journal and thirdly from my own imagination	277.5551
where are you taking me he asked	146.7850
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos	137.2319
there is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfathers room she rose	173.2436
you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me	588.1224
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirls reason which i consider quite beneath me	262.2149
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you pray dont mention such a thing said the count	79.0334
no it is not finished i feel it by what remains in my heart	110.6220
we therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul certainly sir replied the viscount	265.3263
bonacieux what is it it is the uniform of the cardinals guards	38.1596
for me said dartagnan seizing the letter	29.6467
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you but you guess it now do you notor rather you remember it	303.6119
well but cant you speak come monsieur porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton	305.1485
see look at fernand and follow his example he is wellbehaved m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes	304.4925
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the halfopen door and told his master that the horses were ready	211.9138
it is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased	176.9854
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme	67.8779
back already what can have happened then to bragelonne let him enter cried dartagnan let him come up but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it	124.0121
the following morning they arrived at châlons where the counts steamboat waited for them	370.5645
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	194.4882
you wish to make me believe something too dreadful	767.8814
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor	189.4519
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream	89.0528
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also	104.2868
wretched men their officers wish to see you sir i have no time to see them	31.1036
acknowledge it beauchamp your courage cannot be doubted not so murmured the journalist on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the words died on his lips	175.4825
i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton he will not escape the chastisement he deserves felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the puritans styled simply satan	235.7728
explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment	623.7339
m the same deadly silence succeeded these words	1046.9576
the injured man had recovered his senses	69.1321
what is the day of the month asked he of jacopo who sat down beside him	155.9200
ask dartagnan to london gentlemen said dartagnan	7.2515
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased god	458.6729
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	140.2612
i reasoned thusmoney time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend	382.2289
who said valentine was dead the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terrorstricken	122.1585

aramis returned home and athos and dartagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire	2590.8213
it was dark and silent as the tomb	128.9274
she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself you have been free to choose your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze	224.0297

morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank	1113.6663
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great haste	72.7035
it was simply yet richly furnished	2251.4438
during dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage	93.6489
pardon me i love him so much these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace	174.1692
thats a daring rascal whispered the count	10.6582
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening	161.9641
am i mistaken then said monte cristo	5.4893
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do	35.0393
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber aboveas he supposed the bedroom of athos	258.8423
george villiers duke of buckingham mme	4676.2578
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away that was true ah i see that nobleman was you it was his father hush do not speak so loud madame he is there he is there my son the son of marie michon but i must see him instantly take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother you have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy	121.3876
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god	217.6214
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud	531.5153
i suffered that is all yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	749.9775

she has never been so kind before	786.7335
i hoped to be able to rely upon that and i madame said dartagnan embarrassed you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way dartagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme	179.2272
this immediately recalled to dartagnans mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme	67.0146
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself	290.4916
the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in _limpartial_ who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name	231.8952
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws	387.1225
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetanos description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself	156.7871
some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close	275.4170
but the voyage was not ended	1523.4830
be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven oclock in the evening on the road to chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant no signature	130.6707
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule dartagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain lauxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy	294.6112
morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond i will let you know that directly i have seen m	77.4407
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fatewhich would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an endone of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young mans shoulder	173.8262
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husbands arm	559.2914

then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room	108.3988
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	222.1341
that is not probable it is possible said milady	44.1560
her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan	788.3137
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	176.3787
dessessart pointing to dartagnan and as to the four or five volunteers monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be wanting four men of good will who will risk being killed with me said dartagnan raising his sword	149.8321
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock	279.5733

she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile	258.3660
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent	296.9883
try aramis to keep near the king	36.8311
and by what gate did they go out by the saint maur gate if you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged tomorrow and if you catch up with them you wont come back to hang me murmured the sergeant	177.4670
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his sons warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the distance	496.5454
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged the king was invited to come and see the hanging	164.2228

at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment	1055.3729
the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice	228.1927
dartagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop	266.4676
dartagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice	44.6493
de tréville was at the moment in rather illhumor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving dartagnans response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his countrya double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to dartagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent	158.9639
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me	145.1613
order was reestablished in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another	312.9859
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurators wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory	144.4886
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple	183.5473
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance	320.8327
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard	99.5588
by eight oclock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos	41.4671

mousqueton sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth	33.2266
you will also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of this country he bowed	268.0778
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i cannot say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service	152.2102
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants	130.2681
can i be of any use to you chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow	156.1365
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds	269.9684
i have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were doomed the truth is im very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me said porthos	144.1786
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry out	157.4648
i will break every bone in your body cried the duke	66.7372
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders	550.4102
all falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face	211.5510
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by onehalf of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating	189.9179
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone	91.4941
upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop	241.4549
do you understand the meaning of my words	28.7654
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night	42.4496
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself	233.8492
madame said athos when must we set out you consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully	198.7498
now let us return to the first	30.7488
that is my answer the answer was terrible	502.4326
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was madsuch a conviction would be so terrible but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them	171.5406
noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kings attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed	89.9454
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each cornerthe signal agreed uponwaved it in the air and the man came up to him	277.2736
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion	314.2960
monsieur you appear to be in great haste no one can be more so monsieur i am sorry for that said dartagnan for as i am in great haste likewise i wish to beg you to render me a service what to let me sail first thats impossible said the gentleman i have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours and by tomorrow at midday i must be in london i have performed that same distance in forty hours and by ten oclock in the morning i must be in london very sorry monsieur but i was here first and will not sail second i am sorry too monsieur but i arrived second and must sail first the kings service said the gentleman	127.8001
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it	102.4623
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied dartagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn	143.0283
now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter you are right it was left on board then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio no and what did you do with this same letter while returning from portoferrajo to the vessel i carried it in my hand so that when you went on board the _pharaon_ everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand yes danglars as well as the rest danglars as well as others now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest	135.4564
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis	423.8048
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her	177.3067
the first who advances is a dead man cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back	148.9217
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the antechamber	33.6816
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfs narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	778.4467
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinals cap then he added so my friend its your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape thats my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it	101.4972
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was dartagnans mount	2379.4346
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers	180.3985
zounds want one cried the gascon	87.9824
lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her	97.3727
go monsieur duke and return often	47107.9336
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes	16719.1797
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to miladys chamber	216.6927
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine willingly said albert but let us walk	120.0239
let us start then we need no witnesses very true said monte cristo it is unnecessary we know each other so well on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other indeed said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness let us see	92.5087
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice	70.2588
dantès instantly turned to meet him	10.0054
well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in gods sight	303.9652
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	157.8262
let my lord at two oclock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts and then your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again i understand said the duke	129.1737
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal _proprio motu_	491.6569
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope hope repeated danglars	347.6295
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise	187.7488
read it obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him	151.5243
the queen had confidence in the courage of dartagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced	65.7551
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly	391.4274
a sort of smile played on his lips	32.3045
there are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow	390.4962
his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre	314.4624

edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray	459.4338
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham	227.3192
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces	206.6925
has your excellency anything to ask me said vampa with a smile	62.3609
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme	289.2277
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar	819.9945
it was in fact a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne	1399.8971
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart	68.6077
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos	83.3094
i really never heard a person speak as you do because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us why should they not	490.5878
there he found everything arranged in due orderthe accusation examination morrels petition m	3163.5713
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy	397.2293
molière had not written his scene in lavare then	3131.0024
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	136.3988
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness	5903.2598
beauchamps i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	71.0979
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself monsieur dartagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an _obolus_ for your life i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence	91.7879
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket you see then said dartagnan that i must have that letter	73.7700
these gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water theyve allowed him to walk over the border dartagnan began to smile	225.3040
let us see the dungeons let us first send for two soldiers said the governor	105.1894
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bankbills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a fathers mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	393.9964
a draught of wine dartagnan oh ill answer for you said the gascon filling porthoss glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion upon what asked porthos	214.7689
but what if i were mistaken a shudder passed over him	150.0647
the young girls lover was in cucumettos troop his name was carlini	1087.1313
lord how i have eaten m	239.8400
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his doublet	247.1544
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror	94.4443
a black point floated on the sea	25.9137
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which dartagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeers uniform	477.7993
the handsome madeleine announced to dartagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit	231.4999
i say _there_ for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there	381.9549
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him	445.5387
monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk muchmonsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar but where is athos now cried dartagnan	199.1461
and you killed her the monk exclaimed	714.2147
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips	134.0017
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée dantin to m	63.5401
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself	69.0651
it is no nonsense it is quite true	42.7935
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello	87.6942
i saw the soldiers shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dantès	158.4447
aramis whom we have sent for thats true said athos we must wait for aramis at that moment aramis entered	75.1048
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile	343.7564
no you are a physician well i tell you i will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner the bare idea would kill mewould drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my fingernails and if you were mistaken doctorif it were not my daughterif i should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my childholdif that should happen although i am a christian m	220.7718
albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care	290.4474
of danglars yes to be sure must i say baron danglars	253.7779
lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the dukes chamber	127.8444
go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you	100.3876
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart	135.3627
the two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst	165.5986
nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawingroom astonishment was at its height	149.2447
dartagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the night	197.0151
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue	456.7249
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos	107.4239
during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side	286.3913
i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days nor i said madame danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish which m	169.1306
i think only that i have known you not a whole year	105.5404
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness	197.1671
while he was doing this dartagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared	221.5274
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension	141.0893
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	256.4503
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her dartagnan would have returned home since he had so promised	114.4779
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier	120.9725
dont suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort	101.3619
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished	427.9732
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with wellfeigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed	173.6074
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	49.8421
let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other	90.6503
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea	114.1134
thats the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of mine	93.3752
for what reason is all this fume and fury asked athos	660.6827
no where i can confess but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul	99.5478
come there cannot be too many m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m	52.2696
the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will	960.1012

i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king yes madame but on the frontier he was met by lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings	358.2120
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving	334.8104
de villefort was as usual unmoved	12245.3076
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	544.8273
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress but then you would be close to the sea that is what i hoped and supposing you had succeeded i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near herethe isle de daume or the isle de tiboulenand then i should have been safe could you have swum so far heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost all yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me tell me at least who you are i ami am no you mistrust me then said dantès	220.5797
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich	982.8928
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the manycolored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles	460.1330
is it from mere humanity you bid me live	252.4308
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunesemmanuel herbaut monte cristo smiled imperceptibly	828.9177
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key	103.4569
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce dartagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos	115.1097
pardon meat least such i have heard is your custom nay madame	218.4192
now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate spot in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace it was because you loved me was it not count	133.4066
have i sir comprehended your instructions athos smiled	919.2064
i also have made my preparations this morning oh heavens yes said aramis	174.5196
andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the _cheval rouge_ but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues	237.6840
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure hell be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires	229.5696
what am i to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant	241.9051
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son	114.4782
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised dartagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	175.4448
the utility of stovepipes it was evident that without suspecting it and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection	437.9449
our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at tableat least i hope sotwo benefactors of humanity what shall we do said debray we have only one monthyon prize well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp that is the way the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma and where does he come from asked debray	250.3911
what is life to mevery little without you mother for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name	127.4282
in the meantime i remain here	162.7674
the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentines room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment	213.3072
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour to tell you that you are free your excellency my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleons maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life	138.5413
aha continued dartagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced	364.0929
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity	607.2776
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do	21.1884
it was therefore near seven oclock but edmonds anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head	193.6591
he took his army to the priests where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornets who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal dartagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companionsas the breakfast at the priests could only be counted as half a repastin return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him	358.5404
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall aramis seized his knife dartagnan arose	120.1505
i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saintméran has fallen a victim i did	126.5146
slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject	152.2175
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thingthen be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance	451.6153
do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier	201.1146
danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m	67.1339
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded	186.4648
touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn i shall die grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too	217.9280
is the spot far from here a hundred leagues it is not illplanned said the governor	217.5314
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business	283.3300
and he is very rich i am not so sure of that and yet you said he had money fifty thousand livresa mere trifle he is well educated hem said monte cristo in his turn	181.9774
madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawingroom a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it some grand personagea prince i believe they saidthe count of monte cristo i will come directly cried valentine aloud	276.5197
beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph	168.6633
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides	312.8705
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not m it does and is not above fifteen feet from it about that well then i will tell you what we must do	132.1129
and you really mean to say monsieur that my dear father is here yes sir and i can even add that i have only just left his company	73.9277
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied	96.1708
but this confession concerns me only	414.5545
now this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers restoring it to the title which belongs to it and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits we will publish the second immediately	248.9629
and what friends awaited him without	175.0699
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the fathers actions	381.9283
it contained my fortune bills upon spain asked the disturbed host	862.9065
oh meddle in nothing which concerns me	72.3431
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins	111.2980
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon	187.0297
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time	207.2577
those two words _your mass_ and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer i sir	116.7065
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye	155.0267
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twentyfive years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hairfalling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose	515.7729
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos	118.2568
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered dartagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen	79.2306
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports	244.0373
but no i should lose myself in the cardinals opinion	96.8932
ah thats the thing replied the gascon	17.4939
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor	153.3205
villefort placed the arm of madame de saintméran within his own and conducted her to his apartment	82.3681
and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you francs for the diamond i had given you and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both was that also poverty pardon reverend sir said caderousse you have saved my life once save me again that is but poor encouragement are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me i am alone said the abbé and i will again have pity on you and will let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the truth ah reverend sir cried caderousse clasping his hands and drawing nearer to monte cristo i may indeed say you are my deliverer you mean to say you have been freed from confinement yes that is true reverend sir who was your liberator an englishman what was his name lord wilmore i know him i shall know if you lie ah reverend sir i tell you the simple truth was this englishman protecting you no not me but a young corsican my companion what was this young corsicans name benedetto is that his christian name he had no other he was a foundling then this young man escaped with you he did in what way we were working at saintmandrier near toulon	165.4373
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with illconcealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse	205.7859
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent	802.9727
ah have you your sword athos cried dartagnan	88.4759
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors	540.5104
you ought i say then to husband the means you have however large the sum may be but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman	230.9842
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage	120.6736
de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother	174.3203
his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand	349.5927
the night monte cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous _suivezmoi_ then he rose and went out	373.4650
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house	239.7473
the park is twenty acrestwenty comprising kitchengardens and a common	2689.3843
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count	67.4700
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos said the procurators wife	184.3367
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents	314.2110
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered	88.2630
danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenantgeneral which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée dantin	221.1827
but grimauds ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses	298.8320
would you like to hear the story sir yes relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history	133.8960
we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars	283.4894
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sisterinlaw to protect and provide for	224.1083
listen said morcerfif mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement	370.2231
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel	229.9638
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying	118.9308
your majesty wishes then you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply	98.1256
do you know what torture is	6.7016
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you	62.8800
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard	163.2629
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified dartagnan and i no doubt with them for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice	183.4217
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt	109.0198
do these belong to the cardinal	315.4643
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it	169.5278
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her masters orders	521.8130
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured	2936.1086
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion	174.2349
oh very shortly madame said he but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day	67.6907
until tomorrow evening you are not at your own disposal let it be then the day after tomorrow said aramis	96.8223
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking	562.7227
you did well to defend the honor of a woman and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant but added he to change the conversation was this lady alone the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal	92.9211
as for me when i have no candle i cant take two steps without knocking against something thats because you havent served said mousqueton	430.1429
he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet	122.1700
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba	120.4240
dartagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	208.1784
had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement	567.0343
dartagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awestruck	152.8118
perform your duty in camp i will do mine elsewhere	254.8119
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful chapter liv	250.9280
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business	112.5316
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge then you disapprove of duelling	216.8211
four large vessels recently built had just been launched	247.2549
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced	731.6495
the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès mate on board the threemaster the _pharaon_ trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to morrel son of marseilles before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines oh no monsieur he is very young how old nineteen or twenty at the most at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was m	175.1326
he is here who miladys son athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence does grimaud know him then no but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him the headsman of bethune exclaimed de winter	140.2069
let us try him my friend said he slowly i wish as the son of an ancient friendfor i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly truei wish i say in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you to discover to you the secrets of our policy	191.9715
my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose	184.8065
de tréville looking earnestly at dartagnan	86.4810
the count of monte cristo she murmured	489.6063
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses	323.2783
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of youa remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn	103.8832
yes and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may maximilian understood him	144.0269
art thou a messenger from god art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or a demon callest thou thyself eloa or astarte do you not know me felton	937.8882
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexanders feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother	198.0639
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic	330.9630
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression	265.1790
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable	680.6576
you are a man of taste	2018.5295
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop	398.4915
de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely	194.8482
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others	62.4274
royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns	868.9117
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentryboxes	570.8524
davrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m	104.3401
tell them this athos resumed dartagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord athos repeated dartagnans words	428.3897
is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence	229.0914
dartagnan and porthos went on meantime to paris	605.8127
yes and thats all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail	276.3492
and you approve of what she saidthat is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your will yes and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently	162.9158
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason	301.1855
he no longer feared realities but phantoms	2679.2737
am i to put this construction on your visit yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny wait a momentno threats if you please m	376.9199
as was his custom dartagnan presented himself at miladys at about nine oclock	179.0914
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning	72.9244
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussels release	175.4964
to reach englandathos lowered his voiceall france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed	336.3990
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol	170.8551
hear me maximilian said his father	111.4332
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything degenerates i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis	289.6443
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the crossroads	344.4507
ah this is something new replied the king	21.7264
you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others	214.2360
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister	225.5012
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology gentlemen gentlemen said dartagnan do not let us lose our time in jesting	165.4579
they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the kings musketeersone of whom was woundedand a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinals guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory yes sire as complete as that of the bridge of ce four men one of them wounded and a youth say you one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself dartagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest friendsthe son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well	218.2992
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i	224.4918
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first	192.6021
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him	113.9163
how very singular cried monte cristo with wellfeigned astonishment	161.2371
who are you madame said the count to the veiled woman	72.1957
the people were shouting and running about with torches	1676.1111
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated châteaurenaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other	239.0035
of what nature why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination	132.3230
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest ah indeedmad repeated monte cristo and what was his mania he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firmament	128.7828
come to us this evening and tomorrow well return your visit capital this evening with you tomorrow at stuarts the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said dartagnan	264.8387
then another important thing raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses	156.1546
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room	208.5170
continue and say what we must do now monsieur laporte said dartagnan finish dressing his majesty we may go then asked the queen	151.1493
oh it is impossibleutterly impossible what i have said i have said answered caderousse	55.4798
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleonwell can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellowcreatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey	331.3136
they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans who according to his custom affected popularity	240.6345
davrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning	97.9482
no my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france what do you think of all this said athos in a low tone to dartagnan after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english	161.2363
well they fastened a thirtysixpound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea really exclaimed the englishman	82.2910
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic	165.7837
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements	448.3891
tomorrow morning dartagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him	132.3722
the watchword is king and ré saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendantfor that night he himself slept in the camp	151.6631
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	28.8343
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no faith said madame de chevreuse say on	93.9787
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied	134.6032
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere	299.2799
had that letter fallen into the hands of another you my dear father would probably ere this have been shot villeforts father laughed	264.5825
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel	309.8479
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hopeoh do not follow my example	339.6777
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a giltheaded screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons	165.5133
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	269.3613
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of lifeto the martial condition of the soldiercomprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess	253.1714
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow	165.4650
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow	164.9608
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience anne colored slightly	2243.2041
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids	275.0828
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brotherinlaw	169.7825
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror	343.1009
tis done they both exclaimed at once	123.1983
do you not see how she suffers haydée answered with a heartrending expression why should he understand this my sister	642.3830
he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister	155.5719
go make out my bill and notify my servant what monsieur will you leave us so soon you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse	120.0417
i buy those horses he said to the groom	101.2434
besides to do all this time is necessarymonths years and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her	285.9736
i dont need the quarter of such a sumi who am still only in the guardsand by selling my saddles i shall procure it	271.5613
i also was married at the deathbed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account still that idea of death madame said villefort	94.1228
you will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine	116.6863
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to dartagnan	119.0533
heigh sir said dartagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouseevading women how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven and very soon they left the inn	136.8720
very well cried dartagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner pooh a little sooner or a little later it isnt worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said dartagnan	302.7293
morrel had passed many an anxious hour	3043.6855
you are about my height pierre said he	692.1724
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existenceyou whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most gratefulat the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve	409.9732
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend dartagnan formed a part	296.3609
his eminence then orders me said the lady	72.9953
i wish my life to be free and open	109.3756
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard	92.2354
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room	154.5460
one of them was made of debray châteaurenaud and beauchamp	326.6793
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secretthe secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself	343.6226
anne of austria at the age of fortysix	431.9582
de châteaurenaud one of the best riders in france and m	334.2137
the minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing after him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be destroyed	212.0220
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them	128.4684
the tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop	126.5057
isnt mousqueton there but he wears my livery my livery will be known replied porthos	486.7413
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the yacht	288.1973
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony only that said mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for porthoss devotion without opening his purse only that	261.3800
the count does not know how should i know	53.2739
when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been	234.3354
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m	156.4890
through the grating however dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saintlaurent and the rue taramis to the quay	215.5500

at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder	106.0544
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready	254.0438

he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical	348.1276
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womans regrets	185.0390

it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmonds admiration of him but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there	158.4234

athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements	182.8786
this time he could not blame dantès	2680.9121

all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted dartagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint	146.4786

all three then cried alls over hush said dartagnan	443.6261
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra	503.9060

then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really isthat is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his graces lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written	138.6133

athos was meditating porthos was twisting his mustache aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet	280.3531
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow	44.8431
take care of your horses cried dartagnan to him	50.5643

aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal	288.3078
on his side however great franzs desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it	235.3110
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone yes said dartagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison him good god to imprison him monseigneur	135.6339
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	240.1389
has he built one here then no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise both the deuceand what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you franz looked at gaetano to see if possible what he thought of this proposal	188.8428
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent	94.2234
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness	112.8851
and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in do you know him i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken	74.5933
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for dartagnan and an ace for himself	346.2511
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmonds cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their ropeladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering	248.4386
yes i am the executioner of lille and this is my history all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention	241.6490
can we do anything for you asked athos	50.0797
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations	312.4796
only grazed a little replied dartagnan my fingers were caught between two stonesthat of the wall and that of my ringand the skin was broken that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully	312.4522

impossible it would be a dishonor to all the nobility fine sport by jove cried porthos with a laugh that shook the windows	308.4600
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you and on what will you sleep said dartagnan	137.7650
in the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed	394.1227
i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons	433.2382
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair	186.6523
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers	474.2321

the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high	280.4741
i wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation but you did not come	78.5004
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to dartagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak	109.6681
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known no for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they were	282.3508
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images	258.8497

oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my fathers mind is really impaired said villefort	229.0700
nobut perhaps you will permit me to call to mindstay the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts	68.0832
albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult	359.7298
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage	318.4908
a nice acquaintance my friend porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the women gentlemen gentlemen cried dartagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious	85.7047
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow	169.1854
the count seized it hastily his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph and he read thou shalt tear out the dragons teeth and shall trample the lions under foot saith the lord ah he exclaimed here is my answer	474.1699
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs but gentlemen i warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration people will come to the rescue ah my lord cried the gascon dont threaten tis a bad example	213.1684
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are today dartagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails	221.0975
she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hands	164.0350
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues	182.0332

ah my mother my poor mother said albert gazing through his tears at his mothers portrait if you know this how much must you suffer come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal	193.0867
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i cannot comprehend indeed yes well then tell him this rochefort	139.8617
the three presents of dartagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april the market town of meung in which the author of _romance of the rose_ was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it	150.5002
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary	130.4935
villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight	359.7473
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends	140.4814
oh you do not know what is seventeen months in prisonseventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambitionto a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instantwho sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited	283.1808
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty	228.2432
danglars i cannot help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile	179.4473
no more than a drop of water in the ocean remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the abbé	194.4454

the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message	119.4138
she sighed as she looked at him	8.3707
ah theres another brave and excellent young man do you know him asked the officer	46.1978
should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it at once into money i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my fathers chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents and i should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me	242.7816
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner	246.4288
they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards	126.7598

bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper retired	199.2628
more dead than alive he looked around him	36.6878
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officers eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarins purpose	209.1512
bonacieux the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of dartagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that mme	132.0731
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage	315.0372
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act	206.7347
m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusionthat the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life	370.0150
time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner	188.4418
theres not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel but asked the sailor where are your companions	118.5464
and then must not all be over	647.0596
one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might	147.5780
at the first word before i had even mentioned your fathers name ah said he	115.1932
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly	147.5491
poor child are all these crimes committed on his account ah then you at length understand heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him valentine you are an angel but why is my grandfather allowed to live it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon _aqua tofana_	236.6551
sdeath i would die willingly for the king but supposing i happened to be killed on account of mazarin as your nephew came near being today there could be nothing in paradise however well placed i might be there that could console me for it well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty	185.9321
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his fathers name before haydée	204.2620

franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment	154.2496
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting pistols then at eight oclock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being	203.3530
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lackeys porthoss plan appears to me to be impracticable said dartagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you	187.1662
you are now sanguinary but take care	299.2848
well everything was finished as you know	27.8600
well then you must be registered as charlotte backson milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror	499.0844
but why do you ask i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know	39.6980
groslow said aramis the devil who is this groslow asked porthos	136.8378

those wretches wanted to take away my sword deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde	611.1511
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to her	145.3327

rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner	332.1103
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off	202.5361
i am not mistaken dartagnan cried rochefort	292.6817
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed	140.0503
from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh	3730.2830

one day you will be able to understand how all this is well then to the king your nephew	80.5814

the famous secretaire is in the dressingroom is there a window in the dressingroom twoone here and one there andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom	209.9659
oh madame cried mazarin you have ruined us allthe king yourself and me at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges	321.6146
well i follow its course i track its passage i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes well oh speak speak doctor i shall have courage well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one	237.6536

his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twentyfive and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile	515.0361
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered	48.8064
but you dont know us when we cant have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host	386.2244
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause	1054.2100
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another	283.4654
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank	127.4016
yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you	85.8360
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth	581.5760
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body was that i saw that i heard	195.7107
ah cried blaisois he is lost grimauds a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton	1154.1714
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated	156.1624
now let us return to your particular world	617.1080
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries	146.4444
well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed	130.2354
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disordersthen certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body	253.5615
in what can i have offended heri who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave	277.1635
this evening then at nine oclock adieu till then notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the counts hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared	172.8958
the intrepid treasureseeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	305.8699
peste if he is giving away hats like that porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment tomorrow	427.2746
it is for me to give orders here and not you monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you i want none it was a temporary indisposition	204.2231
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked	143.0341
proceed was heard on all sides	585.4910
no no i go i depart i believe in you and i would have all the merit of my devotion even if that devotion were stupidity	190.2538
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help what is the matter with your highness asked la ramee	151.4781
it is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbé busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolenthat was all oh your excellency returned bertuccio in deep contempt	174.9875
which means that i have just been dupedsixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour dartagnan and athos laughed aloud	188.8755
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tonguetied	599.1498
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach	1040.1792
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward	109.9807
one opposite to me the other with his back to me good	195.1854
and after this reasoning she slept easily	2341.5129
silence and fatigue together overcame dartagnan and sleep overtook him also	337.3770
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges thats all but where to find this man i know not have you no information as to his abiding place none	261.8012
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in	312.3722
her maiden name was de servières and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars but i have already met m	123.8878
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter	522.0839
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me i	150.8261
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier	327.0249
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our moneya sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy	406.4727
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre	162.7457
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	51.4302
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair	30.5163
it was only a way of speaking	87.6476
but what brings you here his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you i only arrived yesterday and what have you been doing since yesterday i have not lost my time oh i dont doubt that do you know whom i have encountered here no guess how can i that young woman whom the queen took out of prison the mistress of that fellow dartagnan yes madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this woman does she know you no then she looks upon you as a stranger milady smiled	157.5262
we will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength up great god said mme	183.6976
but poor captain leclere what happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation	77.2661
i shall be about again in a few days why did you not have yourself conveyed to paris	81.7651
thank you dartagnan said comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your namethat i may mention it to the queen raoul was about to reply when dartagnan bent down to his ear	166.2857
mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor	84.0139
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations	503.2051
oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends	48.5671
your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and i advise you to tell the whole truth for your repentance alone can remove the anger of the cardinal why i am ready to tell everything cried bonacieux at least all that i know	134.1278
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you save my husband save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself	108.2321
but at the very moment when dartagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m	46.3400
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left	79.1664
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine	112.7343
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today but you have the first claim m	121.9172
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served	244.5625
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening	75.5189
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking	307.3628
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman however that may be dartagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	127.2349
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory	141.5621
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet continue said the queen	398.4679
is it not so father the old man made a sign in the affirmative	53.8866
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million the count took into his hands the papers which danglars had so proudly presented to him and read to the governor of the bank	136.3646
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened	132.7067
it concerns me much said dartagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since and since asked the swiss	153.6475
we have seen them at villeforts they proceeded then on their course	329.9080
embrace also our good and brave porthos	1038.4502
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell	189.0363
you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely the poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts	451.5154
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing	336.0974
these bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo la ramee la ramee came into the room	167.2388
shall i draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his	191.5753
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him	115.7600
you cannot imagine mother how beautiful i think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love	83.9999
he labored and toiled until he had amassed francs six years sufficed to achieve this object	362.9059
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens you shall have no weapon left in your power there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it	167.0562
the king has nothing like it no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin	79.5889
he did not look like an executioner and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way	125.8625
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood	2635.4585
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts	385.2166
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined	233.5056
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity	106.7753
your mother albert knows that poor house well	351.2142
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top	546.8726
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jews again what will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain	170.3027
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated	256.5574
since you demand my resignation i retire then said aramis in his neighbors ear the conferences are over	227.4630
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible	106.3971
the perspiration poured forth upon the young mans brow and he felt as if he should faint	65.9339
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face	149.2053
he had contemplated danger with a smile and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher pain thou art not an evil he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him	358.3815
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy yes replied aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess i once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us	133.3601
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain	300.3613
now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind	341.7014
monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story	158.2898
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead	215.1799
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment	46.2118
it was indeed planchet and grimaud	870.8014
have you then power against death	981.0236
we are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost mousqueton heaved a deep sigh	435.6295
i once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am i monte cristo approached her and silently took her hand	146.2338
yes but first give me this letter you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet stop a moment said the deputy as dantès took his hat and gloves	113.0904
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me so much the betterso much the better said caderousse	200.6442
what are you about said dartagnan	15.3554
by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare	217.5638
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully	116.0720
de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m	1249.9447
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis	183.6420
what i hate today i adore tomorrow and vice versa	11322.5635
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur	186.4388
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	469.1248
halloo la ramee some one la ramee ran in haste to obey the call	155.4605
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing	114.8907
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind	143.9514
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction	581.8160
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it	76.1208
dartagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet underground	418.5770
listen i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it the music of _william tell_ is so sweet chapter	398.0520
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length dartagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick	120.5210
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	105.6526
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos	398.4702
morbleu cried the latter i should say that i do pledge myself to it i had no hope of getting off so easily he gives you his word of honor said gondy	163.2131
i cannot be mistaken there are your horses the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the counts carriage my dappled grays demanded the baroness springing to the window	227.6545
what does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made	119.9689
charlotte backson comtesse de la fère milady de winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven	282.7376
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself	94.3755
but to return to what we were saying	102.3092
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos	54.5948
thats true said he quietly for my part i have never loved acknowledge then you stony heart said dartagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts tender hearts pierced hearts said athos	393.3827
oh yes perfectly safe and sound my good host and i wish to know what has become of our young man he is better said the host he fainted quite away indeed said the gentleman	113.9971
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the evening	34.7500
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit	24690.5254
all the world was ignorant of it	8.5845
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	177.8410
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him	82.3719
this cost me on your account and mine francs	247.5336
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuels hand significantly watch over him why so asked the young man surprised	216.5355
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark	214.7821
i will now go up into my apartment	163.6602
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinals hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin	151.4192
these protestations were nothing for mme	1016.5507
he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard nothing	74.3226
yes my lord well let us set out how many men does your eminence wish to escort you you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight as many as my lord wishes i will follow you	123.0435
it was the twilight of that mysterious country called death suddenly about nine oclock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying	152.7090
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression	355.8042
de saintmérans oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte dartois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence yes they were talking about it when we left paris said m	730.4337
he came toward teresa in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening	121.0441
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness	760.8492
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven	303.5242
can he be inconstant before being happy oh no he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart	142.3627
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites	2221.3462
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock	81.6070
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions well what next said dartagnan laughing in spite of himself	264.5226

give me your arm and let us go very well let us go said caderousse but i dont want your arm at all	55.3563
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted	93.8754

morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimneypiece but availing himself of the doctors order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat	162.5630

what was the matter with you baron dartagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal	62.1683
but alas if he was the friend of dartagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of dartagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer	92.2355
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber	157.5526

at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move	360.0799
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared	120.4150

he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone	344.6883
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful why the man must owe me a fearful grudge does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly not well then and so he is in paris yes and what effect does he produce why said albert he was talked about for a week then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle marss diamonds and so people talked of something else my good fellow said châteaurenaud the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	191.7224
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate	226.6633
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandits wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor	435.7422
i held the horses my hands were full your honor a shot was fired that moment mousqueton shrieked with pain	438.2163
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg sainthonoré	178.0864
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship	253.0140
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him oh count said de winter for whom do you take me for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way de winter shook him by the hand	85.5877

you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven	91.2489
at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoners brains with a pistolshot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account well albert inquired franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall quite so said albert if the way be picturesque the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared	212.5768
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	171.5724
de tréville who held out his hand to him dartagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude	101.4934
well let us sleep at noyon said raoul	249.5515
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned yes do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him no do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine yes then will she die too asked davrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier	246.8614
but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m	372.5439
a light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers	283.1212
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist	401.8870

i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend	373.8987
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of _giving_ myself at present i shall appear to sell myself that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies monseigneur well well said the cardinal i dont wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends	118.2885
it was a lovely starlight nightthey had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into lightwaves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous oceanwaves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes dowaves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp	1384.1718
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty here it is replied aramis	186.7882
yes his mother but does he know this secret then i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession unhappy man cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one i hope i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mothers as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges thus speaking he fell back exhausted	199.9063
be assured then of seeing me soon return capital cried athos you are the king of poets my dear aramis	245.8652
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort	192.4439
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed	215.8225
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos	348.1907
m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission	137.8031
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears	170.9922
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner	132.4374
you might have taken lord winterwho tis said was your uncleprisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisonerswe preferred taking them mordaunts very lips grew white with rage	583.8684

de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king	81.9716
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and wellstudied course oh yesyes i do sir it is the _pede claudo_ of the ancients	312.0623
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it	208.0886
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five oclock in the morning	145.1523
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained fortyeight hours without eating or drinking	292.0332
the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim take all needful precautions replied the inspector	299.0883
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude	358.6824
the sea continued to get calmer	11810079.0000
that will do said he leave the rest to me will the petition go soon today countersigned by you the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom	183.1821
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince	647.2648
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue	424.3055
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure	681.8010
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her dont try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis	226.8464
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not	32.3972
oh how feverish you are we must not send for a notary but for a doctor a doctor said she shrugging her shoulders i am not ill i am thirstythat is all m what are you drinking dear grandmamma the same as usual my dear my glass is there on the tablegive it to me valentine valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre	153.7257
the shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence	106.9001
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle there was no one like him for that and now replied dartagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us	184.1126
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her	156.8287
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamondhilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle	254.9481
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary	206.3662
no and yet they refused to buy it why said châteaurenaud	69.7686
one evening i was in a garden a clump of trees concealed me no one suspected i was there	189.6889
monsieur dartagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed dartagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle	111.4186
as for porthos on whom dartagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute	118.7972
at ten oclock the kings collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers	210.5427
there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration	3144.8550
several persons are invited and among others m	617.3956
i persons whom i do not like yes indeed	103.0365
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren	324.6378
i come from the cardinal said the officer	30.2033
then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it	334.3715
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are i rely on you valentine said morrel all you do will be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saintméran insist that m	187.6791
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle	272.2345
he preferred to use the sittingroom upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre	358.7963
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him	146.1681
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the popes butler	270.9361
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee	786.5764
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning	153.7532
you understand athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m	130.3148
he did not wear the uniform cloakwhich was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independencebut a ceruleanblue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun	831.2324
but tell me well what do you wish to know will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight seventeen replied albert	90.1573
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for levêque of latude from the bastille	257.4612
it is not fernand mondegos treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheardof miseries which were its consequences and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did alberts declaration	266.2572
the devil my dear aramis said dartagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them you are mistaken friend dartagnan said aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in onesyllable verse which i began yonder ah indeed said dartagnan	167.8117
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my suicide	347.6222
she is perhaps a prisoner she is perhaps dead yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted while i well nothing replied aramis nothing so you renounce the world then forever that is a settled thinga resolution registered forever you are my friend today tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow or rather even you will no longer exist	169.4691
the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti not so mademoiselle eugénie danglars	343.1714
you will restore them to her majesty and as a last memorialhe looked round for some valuable objectyou will add he still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade	273.3938
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag	351.4975
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied dartagnan	134.9608
beauty has always been and always will be allpowerful	876.0541
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is a forgery how can that be yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you but it is dartagnan that will come do not deceive yourself	106.6542
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent	193.4765
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse	616.2908
well but we should be taken out of prison madame bonacieux was released	215.4911
say rather crime replied the doctor	205.4340
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister	58.2137
indeed madame you believe me too credulous confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage i invent nothing madame i create nothing	345.9735
well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which i have put on some vineleaves to please you wicked one	405.4120
de monte cristo the count bowed	352.3015
and will you sign the contract i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me	101.1185
this evening the margin of possible delay expires what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them tonight pardieu we must go and look for them all right said athos	128.4379
the coast owing to the gascons stratagem was clear	1733.1560
i understand said monte cristo well acquainted with alis pantomime you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleepingchamber ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative	602.6509
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris pshaw pshaw i cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it	150.9180
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	468.3577
de villefort all i seek is happiness valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks	793.1838
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom	133.5906
certainly his panegyric has been uttered they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love	255.9350
go young men go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely	1575.9059
henceforth we have nothing to fear	539.2021
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you dartagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man oh thats very well young man continued m	205.3382
two aces the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment	105.5022
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow	51.1883
i have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself yes ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty i have been a captain in the queens guards for twenty years was the reply	114.9514
come let us speak of your little affairs	270.6720
yes and who is the man i do not know why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ballroom to find you oh said the countess to franz go with all speedpoor young man perhaps some accident has happened to him i will hasten replied franz	108.4631
danglars conceals at least half of his fortune and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said andrea with a look sparkling with joy	170.0142
felton cried she you are as great as judas maccabeus if you die i will die with you that is all i can say to you silence cried felton we are here in fact they touched the sloop	142.8604
the boat moved off toward the lefthand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the righthand bank where they fell on their knees	183.8662
villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is removed had m	336.9944
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out	197.0328
the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door	102.6626
all is ready for tomorrow evening	380.6235
at nine oclock madame la première présidente arrived	190533.4844
are you come to fetch me asked he	39.2289
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence	207.5966
marvelous that falls out oddly three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman	189.4251
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m	52.7998
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses	238.9704
de beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what i ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer	467.7038
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing ah said a gallant old general who in had sung _partant pour la syrie_we will not go alone to the garden then said mercédès i will lead the way turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercédès	249.4718
he repaired then instantly to the office of the _lieutenantcriminel_	202.1360
fortunately deceived by dartagnans trick they neglected to reload their guns	1217.9185
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy	174.1256
adieu we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness	122.8702
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future	137.4899
are you ready sir he said at last	82.6739
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity	218.7672
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us	917.1451
dartagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding	281.0472
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he cannot offer she offers to herself and although it is generally with her husbands money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him	236.5145
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier	62.7398
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of dartagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever	118.3932
yes admirable _prorsus admirabile_ continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers	209.2556
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor m i did and you followed the business of a tailor true i was a tailor till the trade fell off	126.4278
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis	517.8022
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me	85.8061
the devil thought porthos this is poor work	310.8096
no but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing	101.0069
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	71.9437
ever since valentines dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad	119.6098
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman	137.2372
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira	976.9907
what shall i say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battlefield that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier dherblay and of surrendering only to fifty men the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst dartagnan and porthos stepped backward	123.3341
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniardstwenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet	370.4229
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased	127.4906
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikelythat is a second restoration	355.6081
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everythingyou are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni	201.0925
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction he is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions	178.5659
ah the traitor and he disappeared	702.8241
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa	146.6954
this rabbit dead the abbé adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day	724.1259
you do not believe me m	243.2652
must i take anything with me money if you have any yes fortunately they have left me all i had so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel here said milady placing a bag full of louis in feltons hands	172.7899
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity	1862.9282
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques	115.2753
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence	180.1033
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house	101.0188
i cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis	152.9990
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity	242.0892
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed	141.2373
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom	241.3174
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button then i must give up the idea no we have them readymade	228.4516
would you have given up the letter aramis said dartagnan	83.7545
he was very taciturn this worthy signor	3235.8147
no be assured i am not mad	94.4607
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc	326.2530
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton	195.3236
constance madame bonacieux ah thats true said athos	15.8101
noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied davrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureurs study	363.4972
a gascon a match for cupid chapter xxxvi	21615.3750
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator	231.0285
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it	95.4105
adieu i entreat you doctor all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal	585.5192
two shots were fired at once one by dartagnan the other by the adversary of porthos	125.1839

because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbowso do you understand what i mean yes sir	132.7481

his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time	148.6729
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where dartagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be	258.7372

no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilians situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window	143.3594
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger	109.3811
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik that is just said richelieu	362.6537
i will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak i beg of you valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine	124.6008

go i will ask his servant bonacieux reentered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to dartagnans door and knocked	146.3892
what is this name of monte cristo inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title i believe mother it is merely a title	124.4505
morrel left on old dantès chimneypiece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt	363.9268
i have the purse still by mea large one made of red silk and asked the abbé is m	312.3665
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellousthat which we do not understand	135.3752
dartagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated	418.3873
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall	188.6761
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys	121.5827

patrick cried the duke opening the door of the chapel patrick his confidential valet appeared	251.8804
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i cannot say that i have seen anything extraordinary	74.6202
but what are you going to fight about athos asked aramis	103.1249
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del montecattini here is the priests certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment	286.3340
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others	373.5181
see i have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves	324.6027
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days	524.2759
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle	371.4723
what is become of them you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day	116.9332
oh you beautiful good little creature said milady	108.0654
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence	765.3434
your majestys mind may be quite at ease replied the officer i have my answer ready the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu	143.4140
we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay go go exclaimed dantès	285.9188
his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever his brow was more pale than it generally was his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him	252.4108
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friends chateau and there we have come to an understanding	105.1559
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale	100.8495
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg license when you share it without charge with others	103.1459
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house	165.3981
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure	205.5283
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the _pharaon_ but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the kings attorney m true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise	208.5504
for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during teatime _ma foi_ i should like to smoke monte cristo took the gong and struck it once	243.5793
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit	390.2438
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his whitebellied blackclawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him	348.5189
de morcerf as you saw and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together	153.7565
the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were seven	3699.0552
you have been here a very long time john said he	388.9966
de la trémouilles testimony and himself	351.6196

the generation who follow us are very precocious come beauchamp said châteaurenaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us	163.6339
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder	98.8454
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today dantès made no reply	372.7772
bonacieux who had sent for m	288.7270
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve	142.5945
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her	115.5250
the gascons are the scots of france dartagnan bowed to the duke and was retiring	127.2413
he must now get his bearings	21398.1504
doubtless although less evident monte cristos joy was not less intense	224.1148
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her off	157.3893
it is true i fought with tolerable success i dont speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others dartagnan pretended astonishment	469.8773
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music	697.4086
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	136.4045
i was most anxious to see you but it must have vexed m	125.6169
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread	330.7865
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the counts lips	319.2608
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf	201.1077
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase	288.4904
just so then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent	167.2898
the youth brought a small loaf	26552.5254
in a moment you didnt forget my purse no be easy good porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post	146.4232
how old is she inquired the vicomte de bragelonne	55.4054
de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor	2110.6099
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life	249.9678
well asked the duke when they were alone	77.5970
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later mazarin coughed a little	341.7543
oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder	234.3068
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber	287.0311
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justicethy words are words of gold chapter xx	707.4227
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table	57.8082

speak i am ready to obey no monsieur no i am not called louis the just without reason	214.0609
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one	152.1779
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog i like the means well enough said dartagnan but where and how to meet with her time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man	144.2654
this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them	123.4774
furthermore dartagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow	754.9444
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics well listen my dear aramis said dartagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor	293.1369
devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing i havent seen you with so cheerful a face these five years the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramees ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him	120.8592
porthos was in bed and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with mousqueton to keep his hand in while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell	627.8188
how if there is any left murmured he	477.0081
the thieves had already approached andrea some screaming _la savatela savate_ a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an ironheeled one	928.7635
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at estrée sometimes at jarrie the cardinals quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment	588.0125
de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him	117.8435
let us strive i beseech youlet us strive to be cheerful yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind	309.9654
thin and lanky the executioner said dartagnan and aramis at the same time	28.4219
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvreall which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham	132.9605
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos	215.1741
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt	246.7145
planchet had followed the road like athos he had discovered the stains of blood like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted	188.4784
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief	234.6557
the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner	181.0239

for you and your comrades this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm	350.9524
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day	177.3068
athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a foot	225.0069
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another	114.2077
the conversation took place in englisha language which dartagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage	227.3402
at this time athos came up to dartagnan	25.6910
were you not already rich enoughyou who possess nearly a million	1399.3364
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom _errare humanum est_ is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself why do you ask me thatwhat do you wish send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body and you will find traces of poison no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies what do you propose to me davrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my houseimpossible still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish itif you demand it why then it shall be done	200.8020
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty	222.7756
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal	137.1761
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassadors box which box do you mean asked the countess	156.7896
then gloom settled heavily upon him	38.0948
the four lackeys guarded the door and the window	19.2899
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber	134.8846
at ten oclock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten dartagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last but that was not all they must get to london	170.5154
for heavens sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshnessfor heavens sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch what am ithe law	500.7874
during this time in the kiosk at my fathers feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats	290.5732
as dartagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse	165.2607
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly	534.1816
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge	160.0875
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly	709.2169
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner	63.1421
they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak	160.1041
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwells cuirassiers	261.3347
and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will dothat will do monsieur bertuccio spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements	465.5629
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another	236.2717
come said dartagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where athos is no sir replied planchet	208.1590
dartagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	132.0232
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse	158.6056
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg work	136.6977
he was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm	359.5229
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband	169.7781
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak	138.1386
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe	226.4110
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazins house	187.8460
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye	324.5208
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him	110.9108
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guardi did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet	159.2213
she cried out but davrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left	185.2045
in ten minutes it would strike seven	4232.5996
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him	99.0285
i not only permit i desire let them come in the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince	151.5365
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	618.7881
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph	449.1288
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt	123.0796
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel	187.4533
what do you demand that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen	962.9489
de tréville and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me longer the four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes and seeing that m	63.3443
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me well well the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brothers servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop but dartagnan dartagnan if he comes shall we not know it how nothing easier	118.6844
in that case i should beat a retreat	616.1653
place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him no monseigneur no it is not he cried bonacieux no i was deceived	84.0050
come come my little fellow dont be angry	140.1412
ah said he involuntarily following noirtiers eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed	110.1196
d they went to rueil cried aramis	82.6526
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing	117.4149
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m	184.9102
dépinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband indeed i fear m valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmothers last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter i assure you in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please i have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it then said villefort nothing further is required	194.1289
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all	107.7065
yes madame replied the coadjutor i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced	155.5374
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin	419.5546
still marquise it has been so with other usurperscromwell for instance who was not half so bad as napoleon had his partisans and advocates do you know villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain	345.8592
never mind be silent i will write aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue denfer	209.2378
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters	191.4716
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta said the queen	85.9988
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither	102.1204
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air	139.4921
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia	210.9404
what the devil could that handkerchief signify placed where he was dartagnan could not perceive the face of aramis	187.3668
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	139.7010
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuilthe terror of all expert palates	635.5454
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows	249.1561
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal	263.6367
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	156.0293
thats well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment	166.3803
faith i dont very well know	206.2253
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter	377.2466
they halted for the king to dine	254.6706
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	247.5136
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand yes said dartagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you cant think that dartagnan dartagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous	167.1270
for me said dartagnan are you sure of that _pardieu_ monsieur i cant be more sure	94.5862
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow	580.9214
m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the gravediggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	127.6723
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck	229.8298
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise	266.2103
that shoots me said the swiss	818.9235
morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away but i have no more ships and therefore i do not want any sailors no more ships returned penelon well then youll build some well wait for you i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i cannot accept your kind offer no more money	260.2522
the plan adopted by dartagnan was soon perfected	2183.3918
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriagewindow the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo	234.8692
danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence what you count said madame danglars signing if you are take care for i shall never forgive you andrea pricked up his ears	104.0512
the count purchased an island in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you today has founded a commandery	358.5912
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned	126.7393
dartagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week	572.7982
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment	179.8748
and in what have i been so unfortunate as to displease your majesty asked m	132.4993
dartagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten	185.0455
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerfs brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call	283.8667
good thought dartagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable	154.6528
save me i am pursued said andrea clasping his hands	56.2604
a moment cried dartagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their halfdrawn swords	317.8191
my dear mother said he do you know if m	42.2687
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs	119.0354
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school	204.3727
he was dressed in violettinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color	271.6911
ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart hum said the major	85.5301
i am at home to nobody said milady observe to _nobody_ the servant went out	352.9416
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his masters wishes and had already gone to fetch one	136.6512
hardly had dartagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication	187.9343
the gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel	154.7385
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak	197.5620
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known	235.1450
i will no longer detain you m	36.2881
try porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows	142.1277
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long forgotten then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france	127.4931
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels	2419.4363
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him	223.2865
we will judge you in spite of your silence	47.4151
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence	371.0471
one moment yes answered the queen	25.9544
the guards were unable to help any oneeach one was occupied with his selfpreservation	753.9554
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him he is allpowerful even with the king he would crush you at a word	288.4567
yes these three _yeses_ had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation	541.6645
be prudent sensible i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice he kissed her hand tenderly	230.2139
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach	378.1878
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now no father stammered villefort at least i hope not and now my dear boy continued noirtier i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care oh rely on me said villefort	188.7318
de villefort are both coming to this dinner	146.8545
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered	57.2223
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service that may be true replied porthos but i am used to him and besides he wouldnt be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much oh blind selflove thought dartagnan	172.7222
you have continued your course of villany you have robbedyou have assassinated well i should say if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble	185.1056
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false angostura is it not inquired madame de villefort	305.4723
well asked he of the count what has then happened nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced	114.7288
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves	197.0228
be kind enough then to send me francs tomorrow	262.0881
we have no time to lose i will question and do you answer me noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer	74.8974
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them	388.1937
follow you cried bonacieux follow you at this hour where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance	104.0590
nothing at all thats a capital arrangement	2800.0598
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly	210.6910
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death	210.2850
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting	147.5799
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy	85.8006
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waitingmaid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment	159.9198
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife	247.1077
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her	149.0915
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory	1348.9147
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy tis his custom	490.4099
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it	116.9375
only one minute mr felton and you will have saved my honor to kill yourself cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground i have told my secret he knows all my god i am lost felton remained standing motionless and undecided	126.9853
i am neither an angel nor a demon i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all yes yes said felton i doubted but now i believe you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter you believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheriesto that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist i deliver you up to buckingham	157.6609
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us no _pardieu_ though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse	147.6830
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle bravo cried porthos	291.8835
live maximilian and i will be yours	134.6841
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years then no misfortune has happened to you and what misfortune could happen to me	79.4944
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south	509.1942
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended	91.8470
the jailer always brought dantès soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first	315.4646
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step	196.5592
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin	3131.7371
deuce take it cried dartagnan more moved than he had been for a long time dont despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one oh really cried raoul	117.3942
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors bah much monsieur mordaunt would care	158.1360
oh misery oh vanity you take it however yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle	223.7765
dartagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais what then the bodies were not plundered were they	414.2044
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	477.7934
with such a _vade mecum_ dartagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait	471.2521
tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for let us rather persevere in our researches they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted dartagnan to rueil	214.5426
yes but in order to avenge herself she must be free	204.1784
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos	75.9626
good heavens we are on the very eve of it	164.9523
he thought the carriage was about to stop there	66.0046
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief	183.4701
will you take me away with you	44.0067
grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a ferry	158.4886
dartagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	147.8648
oh this is too much cried milady	134.2972
one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis	562.9702
with your belt my lord replied la ramee	21.0689
what did you say sir asked the man	29.8311
at one end was the receipted bill for the francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazelnut with these words on a small slip of parchment _julies dowry_	587.2139
the expression of the counts face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation	163.6432
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission	333.6848
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice	506.8675
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count well i rely upon your promise	99.4831
de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume	233.4850
come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want	134.2384
did the people shout at all cromwell asked	274.6038
i went too but as i was older than fernand and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast	110.9637
suppose we warn the masters lets wait for grimaud but perhaps they have killed him grimaud would have cried out you know he is almost dumb we should have heard the blow then but if he doesnt return here he is at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them	160.5412

zounds what is yonder cried dartagnan	8.5600
it is important that he should receive it before eleven oclock	110.6464
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements	209.9250

but dont think yourselves in a better position than you are	84.4252
the count of monte cristo had just entered	157.4524
what is it you want said the inspector	33.8647
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word	263.0728
and so dantès after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven	390.4539
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around themthen at last the volcano was extinguishedthen all was dark and stillthe floating bark and heaving ocean	1650.9391
great god cried dartagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen	283.2794
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed	84.9728
god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed then you know that i did not leave him i heard your voice up to the last moment here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the queen then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the kings blood	88.8757
attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said dartagnan for myself i will reconnoitre the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard	326.9803
it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings	201.1961
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord that is true said his antagonists	336.8534
before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs go laporte said the queen	200.2138
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica	238.6080
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor	184.5695
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give you dartagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	127.1451
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughters hand	189.9538
suddenly dartagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before	210.4449
i sign my full name for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials the poor duke became perfectly giddy	197.1528
oh yes i know that said dartagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him	67.9194
i certainly never will get drunk again dartagnan it is too bad a habit dartagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me is it to your mind asked dartagnan	140.9924
he went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road but gondy reflected for a moment and then said let him continue his journey all is not then over asked rochefort	114.7767
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadnesswhy we cannot tell	481.4664
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses	244.5350
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern	124.9404
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted	312.5391
dépinay and his family besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two years old it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile	217.4608
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six oclock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening	151.6612
four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received	139.1212
how is that my friend why thus it is replied dantès	149.0100
thirtyfive or thirtysix mother so youngit is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection	182.1425
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious	337.2234
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound ah hell come round thought dartagnan thats not bad this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to dartagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics	140.4926
what troubles me is the idea of defeat	544.1463
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him	151.5686
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme	142.3363
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows	82.9971
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side whence can it arise then	214.6779
emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to fiveandtwenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rosetree raised her head	413.3666
go oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness	89.8584
one was a young man of three or fourandtwenty who was in love with m	132.0236
to be sure for monsieur de wardes now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur dartagnan go to bed mademoiselle said milady i dont like comments dartagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in	139.1720
as to that cried dartagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured how so i will go this very evening to tréville whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brotherinlaw monsieur dessessart but another thing what asked dartagnan seeing that mme	145.1568
you do not understand the points of english horses the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity	779.2878
what the devil captain one cannot win all ones battles the great pompey lost that of pharsalia and francis the first who was as i have heard say as good as other folks nevertheless lost the battle of pavia and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword said aramis for mine was broken at the first parry	227.1222
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch	193.1033
what say you i cannot believe such was the case	243.6778
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above	82.8272
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud dartagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar	496.1454
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the others condescension	658.0571
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsedbut there will be a conference tomorrow and we shall see the two friends saluted the duke	126.4665
alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort	189.6550
m you understand me said the count	8.8841
but i tell you that i am the mistress of the house gentlemen i tell you i am madame bonacieux i tell you i belong to the queen cried the unfortunate woman	46.3494
ah here is one of them i believe in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared	89.3701
let me know what crime i have committed	21.8144
it appeared to me such women as i never weep said milady	157.0810
dartagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the sheath	93.5783
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner	117.1994
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree	111.4805
morrel farewell do you leave me yes i have business in italy	50.4846
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven oclock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel	114.1851
pressing his lips close to the planks he exclaimed dont be alarmed valentineit is i again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so and why do you come so late today	229.7395
the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled	270.7082
what does this mean demanded he of the cardinal	58.0828
oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather inviting what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago	268.9997
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released	394.7800
oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out in what way why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them	116.2605
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body	219.2376
he told me your life was his and i have promised him that you shall live you have promised him that i shall live yes but sir you spoke of vigilance and protection	112.6072
the fifth sharer in edmonds bequest was his own father too true too true ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die i learned so much at marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end	171.1494
you smile yes why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	77.9610
i did my best to make them drunk	302.2714
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other	177.2799
the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert	515.9814
noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind you do not wish me to marry m	109.3002
the latter retained the counts hand between his	87.7531
they are quite new and have not yet been used	175.0435
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance	243.9859
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock	181.9920
do as i bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven oclockyou have heard what i said it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven oclock thought dartagnan thats a settled custom milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tenderly	300.5465
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton	69.1538
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa	704.3123
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there	114.2343
beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us thank you i have just returned from sea what	99.1152
come just acknowledge that i could eh this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand	205.9507
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say furtherthe art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land	320.3067
oh sir exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him it is his son dartagnans arm dropped to his side	111.8096
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness until that time continued the young girl in a calm and selfpossessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to conveywe will wait and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actionsno more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name morrel looked obedience to her commands	313.7372
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions	148.3951
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis	378.6151
his bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deedannihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again	368.7982
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry	300.3317
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me	79.8533
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him	427.4825
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman	228.1004
the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her fathers death	184.2124
adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer	31.4936
this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m	237.4688
one of the officers went to the place i directed	120.3571
you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you grimaud bowed	128.9467
at your service sir he continued	287.3625
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she i am sure of it nevertheless i confess i still doubt but the _fleurdelis_ on her shoulder she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence athos she is your wife i tell you repeated dartagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually it was dartagnan who now shook his head in his turn	140.3731
well he said to the lieutenant	832.8524
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant and here i am said the sergeant	121.0087
those idiots cried porthos they have not even pursued us	195.9018
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart tomorrow dartagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter you have eight days to returnin all sixteen days	119.5096
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him	100.0671
as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name	231.3491
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states	144.2093
in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee a sign from grimaud put him on the alert	121.9876
_ma foi_ yes like you i hesitated but the counts eloquence decides me let us go then said franz since you wish it but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso	116.7922
what is it asked the baroness	123.5561
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report	193.5279
the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point	165.3372
one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp	119.6553
they were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them	143.9967
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villeforts valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness	176.8316
this hole communicated with a kind of loftthe space between the floor of the kings room and the ceiling of the one below it	139.1642
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husbands inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door	214.7692
listen then ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them listen continued the abbé	178.6149
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality	116.0915
at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle	278.8824
another queen in want of help	968.3948
what the devil we are not children	910.4775
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the counts agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	275.4762
the several members of that group were much excited	416.2300
i confess it but pardon to every sin you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper	126.0253
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken	462.2197
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are	38.2291
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover	298.0625
comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du trahoir but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the marketplace with stones and halberds the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house	207.4311
such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament	361.7235
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number one	250.9100
something more terrible more fatal more alarming for usthe child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villeforts hands exclaimed my child was alive said she you buried my child alive	316.0337
why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlinis teeth clenched convulsively	316.4555
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	125.5275
happy rogue said caderousse you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed yes said andrea	76.3317
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house	207.9415
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject	361.2876
give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge	140.7599
no his horse of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite	376.9028
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench	166.5475
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it	147.6187
they have closed up the grating with a board that is well god has made them senseless said felton	213.1366
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m	39.1034

morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of themthey have no time	227.1478
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them	165.9020

eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her	137.1940
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from dartagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence	182.7467

monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne	416.7720
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons stop said the duke pistache jump for the queen and he raised his cane six inches higher	228.2674
rely on me dartagnan knew that although a gascon m	157.5580
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report	382.7533
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other	86.2500
is it by permission that he remains there asked gondy	411.7317
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing	455.6414
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of braccianos but also return to florence alone if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least	184.2481
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty	733.8148
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content	434.0554
it was on thursday the abbés reception day people went there in crowds	3260.7332
what beautiful furniture there must be in it have you ever seen the tuileries no well it surpasses that it must be worth ones while to stoop andrea when that good m	207.2336
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won	283.3743
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither	198.0034
my dear dartagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn my faith said dartagnan with great pleasure	112.9607
if i did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the counts manners i would have taken you to the chamber there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators i shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait ah here is my mother cried the viscount	133.7261
ah said dartagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds	206.1878
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen	100.3043
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discoveredthat is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses the baroness became enraged	377.8086
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips	210.9702
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language	410.2306
chat between brother and sister during the time which lord de winter took to shut the door close a shutter and draw a chair near to his sisterinlaws _fauteuil_ milady anxiously thoughtful plunged her glance into the depths of possibility and discovered all the plan of which she could not even obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen	184.9802
the guards under the command of m	19.3636
she is quite well replied danglars quickly she is at the piano with m	137.1488
and a little bit of a thief oh sir oh and more especially a notorious coward oh oh sir you really vilify me cried olivain	407.8351
leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied my dear albert said franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see _litalienne à alger_ agreed returned albert but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes	227.1638
theres one just arrived and she handed the letter to dartagnan	106.8282
so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly	607.6519
in france the first fear of the king of england charles i on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the rochellais he tried says richelieu in his _memoirs_ to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure	282.7227
is that monsieur said dartagnan to himself	53.2716
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	364.3873
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	151.6882
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired	402.7063
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air well then a happy and merry life to you	194.7764
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin i cried dartagnan not in the least you spoke of a mission did i	177.4164
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	71.0430
that same night the general was to go over to the english	92.2710
as our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the devils	152.0278
what have they done to you theydid you not see what they did no they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england	300.1862
what oclock is it the baron drew out his watch	136.0448
one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges	169.8151
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard	205.4304
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem	207.3923
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable	782.9637
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette madeleine was the daughter of m	612.0817
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully	141.8722
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table	96.5401
bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection	215.7906
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful is it still only an intention your eminence asked dartagnan	100.7959
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay	550.7076
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman	124.4597
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin athos shook his dead doubtfully	397.7280
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold	125.8013
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twentyfive steps	73.7712
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m	336.2263
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected oh indeedindeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercédès	390.0265
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out	157.6401
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career	262.4641
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planches antispasmodics and mint and hoffmans drops are among my favorite remedies	345.6163
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father	101.5034
do you intend opening the door said the baroness	34.4069
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france	198.9797
de châteaurenaud asked beauchamp how is morrel _ma foi_ i have called three times without once seeing him	181.2212
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out goodbye mercédèswe shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas	264.0430
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed	678.7046
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not	80.7265
monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here so there is no chance of my escaping you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently	78.8147
no i must leave you at ten oclock your engagement was for breakfast then said the count	81.4254
neffer neffer dartagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out	230.3111
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase	105.9159
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucienoh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodgers name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a doorkeeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife	193.8481
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil	136.3703
yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own well and what may you have to say against this name inquired albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess franz said no more	120.4931
no but my mother as a child saw her	115.6180
impossible madame impossible edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond why do you not call me mercédès mercédès repeated monte cristo mercédès well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly	123.5996
it is my happiness my treasure my hope	775.8549
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables comminges glanced at dartagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up	171.7588
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for dartagnan	180.2501
come along athos come along cried dartagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his	379.6937
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand	23.9662
whose is the sand upon which we were reclining	144.1493
good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting no said athos	267.0604
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg sainthonoré	154.7197
yes sir by whom inquired cromwell	549.4428
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots	532.1879
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès	257.7028
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers	168.3141
good lord said dartagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything	227.1513
but will that not excite suspicion sir asked the queen	92.4374
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities	193.4210
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter	67.1684
he then looked at the objects near him	2295.7017
i have taken from you one _carte blanche_ to give you another	326.1042
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle	73.7704
approach then said the messenger or i will come nearer to you if you prefer iti will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while i examine itbe it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim	225.9529
for him those ten minutes were very long	180.5797
i shall get nothing from these fools he muttered and i am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward	176.0798
de villefort giving the key to davrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work	223.8627
the presidents sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the generals and had no guard	210.6722
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises	163.7311
if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow said emmanuel it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment do you not form a very rash judgment emmanuel said julie	278.7971
woe to them if it be so and he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the seine	244.3676
as dartagnan had foreseen athos was not within	90.7076
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black	116.1798
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone	143.3862
but this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps death heheincur danger of death no be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere long	626.1888
madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers julie still lay with her head on his shoulder emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrels family and the sailors at the door	99.1025
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering	657.5386
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented	110.3614
anne of austria at the age of fortysix	431.9582
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure	57.6767
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet we went out	181.2765
for my part monsieur i am catholicmy father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a huguenot and what was the end of this worthy man asked dartagnan	251.1983
do you think it is worth while said villefort	241.9566
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos	181.9913
he called for dartagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him dartagnan not being on service	167.8245
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said dartagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m	119.5045
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again	278.2911
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	331.3242
we shall arrive at eight oclock	2.9038
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains	2829.4048
besides it has perhaps been her majestys calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly	829.7367
debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any	56.2642
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him	63.8893
the history of athoss imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong	124.0865
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me the executioner of lille the executioner of lille cried milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid falling	175.6645
the king and his escort were no longer there	164.6932
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her	106.9040
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege	202.9629
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance	181.2443
ods bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up dartagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little and why dartagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis	109.2423
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat	193.4919
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for today she has need of the same courage and the same devotion what exclaimed dartagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or positiondoes she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it	307.9428
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did	76.8388
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	197.0714
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around	86.2984
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took	149.4742
his devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile	253.2751
when all had gone out and the door was closed m	103.3293
have you gone mad my dear friend what is the matter returned dartagnan we are saved i dont see that at all answered porthos	57.7322
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand	118.7736
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done	175.0781
bonacieux therefore ask my own secrets and i will reveal them to you but those of othersthat is quite another thing very well said dartagnan i shall discover them as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become mine beware of what you do cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make dartagnan start in spite of himself	121.5344
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited	214.3693
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between us ingrate that you are ah i advise you to complain said porthos	241.3543
ah believe me edmond as i told you i too have suffered much i repeat it is melancholy to pass ones life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet over	169.3375
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to and instead of gaining francs he would have lost or and what has caused the sudden fall from to asked monte cristo	135.3201
it is in london they must be found what are your eminences orders not a word of what has passed	126.9363
guiche knew everybodymadame de neuillan mademoiselle daubigne mademoiselle de scudery mademoiselle paulet madame de chevreuse	373.8996
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship	270.3981
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	628.0371
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but flygoi give you back your promise it is well said dantès	256.6328
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come	110.5590
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise what a strange man you are what next	242.7932
their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive they were despised when dead yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said monte cristo but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything	188.7162
suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy	250.3005
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably	421.2973
they can move their arms they can and that is much	181.5725
we can talk of it afterward then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed	146.5989
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love	1282.2762
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful	388.6540
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself	137.7412
i have an idea which i will explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation	144.7679
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell	134.9791
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them	1075.4547
in addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal there might be reckoned in paris at that time more than two hundred smaller but still noteworthy levees	182.2821
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set fire to the villa sanfelice to procure a weddingdress for my betrothed an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased m well my dear albert said franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen luigi vampa i say he is a myth replied albert and never had an existence and what may a myth be inquired pastrini	388.9423
my dear friend general cromwell has sent monsieur mordaunt to fetch me	125.0414
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan _thank you be easy_	1200.5347
yes i will accompany you but did you not read that i must be alone said julie	70.6264
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death put him to death franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window	158.5251
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gazethere even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m	237.9238
de rothschild and you have seen her her m the beautiful greek of yesterday no we heard i think the sound of her _guzla_ but she remained perfectly invisible when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains where was this window with white hangings asked the countess	166.2759
you were walking one evening in m	70.9155
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time	174.3814
dartagnan and which she had given her son secretly	511.2059
coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it	296.9247
dartagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	168.4157
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered tomorrow we shall know if you are good in action and i said the marshal what am i to do wait here to receive the troops	96.2281
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror	381.4436
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look	164.6591
just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel why really the thing seems to me simple enough	250.0946
oh yes yes this instant i entreat you in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	135.4452
then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord	130.9829
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department	509.2549
of what country a frenchman your name edmond dantès your profession a sailor how long have you been here since the th of february your crime i am innocent but of what are you accused of having conspired to aid the emperors return what for the emperors returnthe emperor is no longer on the throne then he abdicated at fontainebleau in and was sent to the island of elba	190.9722
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes	1412.5480
gentlemen said dartagnan you shall have your turn	58.7566
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham london the letter shall be given to himself generous girl cried anne of austria	135.8347
lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo	171.5073
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man	40.0672

ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind dartagnan in generosity i would give as much as a hundred pistoles the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates	223.2992

lord de winter exclaimed the count	13.7603
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration_utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_ dartagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m	584.0736
pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight no said albert the engagement is broken off well said beauchamp	200.6914
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	193.7783
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half	55.5332
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	198.2505
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin	176.9979
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles	1061.6685
de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw franz and m	105.5106
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride	174.9595
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way	227.8610
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders	84.0263
dartagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had notwhatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subjectbeen able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence	587.2802
now since dartagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way	140.1459
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity	105.9956
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost	59.6885
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp	208.8307
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck	166.0841
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	498.1543
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance	166.5165
suddenly dartagnan touched something warm which moved	186.7532
look at monsieur du vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage	219.3856
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion	526.6570
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science	304.6427
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it	295.0491
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la ferei can see nothing remarkable about it my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens	167.6810
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it	348.1935
dartagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army	95.8169
sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winters men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winters voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	215.3496
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterdays debauch	151.3492
the fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos	222.0044
he hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one the sword pierced his heart	269.2211
i remained in the room and waited oh heaven m when daylight dawned i went down again	422.0322
pass on your way then it is the best thing to do this raillery exasperated jussac	244.8514
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor	310.7955
devil take the vain fellow said dartagnan	20.3499
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances	301.8665
all at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice	187.7106
do you wish to speak to us asked morrel	62.6520
davrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m	179.3818
however scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is scarcely had the emperor reentered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readershe found on the table there louis xviiis halffilled snuffboxscarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad	527.7086
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor come instantly pray come madame madame cried valentine calling her stepmother and running upstairs to meet her come quick quickand bring your bottle of smellingsalts with you what is the matter said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone	236.9663
still he had not even uttered a sigh	201.8960
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	107.2679
i thought i had quite said groslow	232.0632
besides you must have seen that the person to whom i spoke was a woman that is true but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that since she lodges with him that does not concern me but who is she oh that is not my secret my dear madame bonacieux you are charming but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women do i lose by that no you are on the contrary adorable give me your arm then most willingly	100.3778
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for dartagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin	330.1261
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saintmartin and to be going towards the madeleine	120.4646
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interferencei should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brothers pay alone kept her	222.1517
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m	257.1937
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead	123.9650
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded madeleines brother entered dartagnans service	616.7167
i am inclined to think so anddoyoulikehim why he pleases me in spite of franz dépinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world the countess shuddered	147.1620
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked gondy	107.1030
what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar	209.7877
dartagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments	239.8667
why really i know no one said the major	32.8166
on the morrow he received the last touches of mousquetons brush for an hour and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune	149.2394
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him	58.2372
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybodys professions of friendship	488.7407
mercédès extended her hand to the count	32.6167
uncertainty is still hope then in a low voice morrel addedthis delay is not natural	319.6867
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion	399.6536
can you enlighten me on that point i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse	62.0454
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become	115.2892
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you	123.7136
i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey ordersi have taken an oath to obey and i do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent that most sacred in the world said athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty	186.0954
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to dartagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion	102.2108
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath	286.4983
but is this all that is known they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him on his track said villefort	89.9263
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	167.6381
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster	512.1409
what asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of pistache	160.5065
from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary	310.8539
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal	421.9435
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldricin ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous	298.0807
this time said athos first breaking the silence dartagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once the devil you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter	140.9072
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	255.7487
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat	67.6761
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed	43.3350
staystayhow strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper	126.1701
i am not a priest you are not a priest cried the executioner	46.3506
oh i am dying oh save me a pen a pen said the doctor	139.1555
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room	97.8156
that is good to see said aramis	38.7985
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword	209.7021
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean dartagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on	477.7383
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead	115.9374
i have always observed that they bandage peoples eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the _huguenots_ and really i have nothing to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the _arabian nights_ m alas i may say with lucullus if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit i would have prepared for it	217.5927
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambitionfernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested	381.4949

imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenants ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith	600.3509
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all	127.7435
come said he to the abbé i am anxious to see your treasures the abbé smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès	256.6576
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	1193.0383
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney	159.1004
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the hearts pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed	235.9507
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage	50.6373
the fair worshipper touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the church	114.6284
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo and who is beppo oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holinesss castle indeed you are a provident person i see why you see no one knows what may happen	137.0829
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne	282.4779
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving dartagnan learned that he exercised from six oclock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine oclock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern	203.6555
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria	219.8549
necessity has no law besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least	361.2388
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercédès the old man sank into a chair	122.7125
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful	523.4811
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope then he began to doubt his own innocence which justified in some measure the governors belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man	360.5897
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall	311.0293
rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people	170.3229
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances	383.3853
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips	515.4987
de tréville and ran quickly up the stairs	73.8878
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague ont how fast you go one may soon see that youre a soldier	220.9948
dartagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them	403.8101
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at tréport i felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of me possibly said monte cristo i have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire i was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge m indeed pray tell me how it happened willingly	330.5669
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman womanwhy do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why dont you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moments pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse	124.6329
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel inquired the man with a strong italian accent	139.5376
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked dartagnan	119.0932
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him	461.6694
who sent you come come you are going on quickly m	115.4268
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background	375.8493
ah yes you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each	1166.7511
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation	284.5155
i am sure he will look like the great mogul they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses	250.9138
you must make some reformation in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh	88.6757
dartagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in dartagnans proposal pooh who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you i am lieutenant in his majestys musketeers said dartagnan and consequently your superior in everything only as the question now is not of rank but of quartersyou know the customcome and seek for yours the first to return will recover his chamber dartagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand	166.4234
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco had done over the moor who would have killed him	209.5450
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious	320.1758
the prisoner did not wish to lose time and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed	129.3157
he has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen	117.2477
fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the quay	126.6146
i learn all in the silence of my apartmentsfor instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote m then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedingshe is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done	143.6202
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period	456.8019
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat	682.9880
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers	111.0871

contact the foundation as set forth in section below	193.0984
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos	112.6958
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale	109.6085
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by dartagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them	142.6402
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take i have his letters said she	231.0085
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance	118.8355
this is the case said dartagnan this is your brother madeleine you dont know him perhaps but i know him he has arrived from amsterdam	135.8514
the hands were white but without delicacy the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality	479.2819
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i cannot remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that planetree	99.6261
you who have chateau meadows mountains woodsyou who have forty thousand francs a yearyouarenothappy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine	376.1168
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris	157.0708
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme	176.7085
he seems besotted said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee	226.0683
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison	419.2762
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever	342.0643
let us separate and let us seek the mercers wifethat is the key of the intrigue a woman of such inferior condition can you believe so said porthos protruding his lips with contempt	189.9020
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan	2698.7375
it was not uncommon for richelieu and louis xiii	391.4647
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias	309.3599
bythebye continued dartagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and dartagnan went out followed by bernouin	185.6526
poor fellow poor fellow murmured caderousse	103.0897
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man	166.0857
now go down said the abbé folding his arms	179.9220
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar	124.5044
de villefort get into the same mourningcoach and thought this meeting forboded evil	4420.7637
when one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos	74.9810
we must understand each other said the duke	32.7585
and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece	427.1025
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	216.1325
i thought we agreed for the price i asked that is replied the jeweller i offered francs forty thousand cried la carconte we will not part with it for that sum	134.1903
a great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him	221.1489
de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience	1303.0929
she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them madame said villefort believe me a fortune of francs is not so easily renounced she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent never mind replied villefort i say that this marriage _shall_ be consummated notwithstanding your fathers wishes to the contrary said madame de villefort selecting a new point of attack	182.1117
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited dartagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place	164.6534
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am	255.7499
did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said	80.6623
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart	155.7126
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know	199.6948
it was very hard the horse said morcerf laughing	204.5367
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here ah what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian	140.9757
you had begun to pervert my poor felton	332.8543
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction	163.6301
besides the parisian world is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few days	50.5305
as she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage	241.7168
what makes you believe this why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me	212.4325
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow	98.3924
ah la ramee if you would but accept my offers i would make your fortune how	189.0269
then there was the ring with the lions head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand	135.0218
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villeforts dressingroomi saw i tell you silently enter a white figure valentine screamed	322.2714
stop you are in a shocking hurry to be offyou forget one of my guests	663.7916
however in an hour i shall know all	49.0900
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me i wish to speak with this gentleman m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned	92.5668
take some more of these cigars m	5638.6055
the woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered handkerchief who told you there was a woman here replied aramis becoming as pale as death	111.9855
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to dartagnan	249.1425
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced	45.8443
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary	77.9646
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings	119.2509
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon and what did monsieur dartagnan reply monsieur dartagnan promised me his assistance but i soon found out that he was betraying me you impose upon justice	154.8454
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions	368.8480
i will profit by the advice and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me nothingthe cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory mannerexcept to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions	327.1230
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up	486.9516
ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded oh things take their course without our assistance	196.2687
zounds i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court	166.3758
what do you meanthe album i want the album how dare you tear out the drawings oh it amuses me gogo at once i wont go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way	246.5044

we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers	168.9297
immediately replied dartagnan we have not a minute to lose hello grimaud planchet mousqueton bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hôtel each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey	244.6020
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formeda little fairylike figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue	841.9279
no well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful	248.5340
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	174.0102
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance you have truly monsieur said dartagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you please	109.9918
this was to go himself to m	79.4901
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m	266.3133
dartagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army	316.3576
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to enter	336.8947
he was about to marry a young and charming woman whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the king and besides her personal attractions which were very great mademoiselle de saintmérans family possessed considerable political influence which they would of course exert in his favor	301.9016
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay	178.3781
at this demand dartagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moments audience of m	220.4698
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain	230.8014
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel châteaurenaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m	245.1087
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ballroom that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m	171.1647
one said the gravediggers two three and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle	223.6609
the woman is an agent of the cardinal he has agents then throughout the world cried dartagnan	118.6496
you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about dartagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it	229.9336
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland	310.9313
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly	146.8493
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twentythree years of age said athos in a low tone	158.4448
flee alone flee alone and leave you here	172.1353
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion	155.4752
yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he rings milady sprang out of bed	302.4526
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheardof that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs	220.4792
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mailcoach	289.0994
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign where is the treaty here it is anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that dartagnan presented to her	127.5275
this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss	289.8967
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness	129.1691
having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery	347.2780
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercédès with his eyes glowing and his hands clenchedsay mercédès he said once for all is this your final determination i love edmond dantès the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband and you will always love him as long as i live fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils saidbut if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too if he has forgotten you mercédès called a joyous voice from withoutmercédès ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him	175.5904
then said she he has well played his part who has he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal it was then a part he was playing yes my child that man then was not that man said milady lowering her voice is my brother your brother cried mme	131.1548
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town	115.3153
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay	175.4508
no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of anyones	336.1461
now my wife came home four days ago monsieur	217.3473
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii	297.2931
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head	61.6487
de morcerf is it that excellent m	1815.6781
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood	211.2164
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinals	378.9088
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the kings room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of dartagnan and porthos	214.4710
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it	361.5371
my words have not convinced you	22.8434
i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also how could i pronounce that word	240.9698
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone	250.2112
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	161.1137
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate	93.8647
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul	150.6132
in the place of the palais royal dartagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens	351.5605
the young man appeared on the threshold of the ministers closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter	65.7607
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six oclock in the morning	37.2844
at length they arrived at the cemetery	85.1683
see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them	178.6283
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church	223.2401
you will enter by the rue neuve sainte catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary	483.6441
oho whats that the lightning answered the captain our felucca so far so good laughed athos	412.7858
disguised it was very boldly written if disguised stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation	199.8610
anne of austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself but this was not what louis xiii	251.3168
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light	94.4892
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thoughtin what way was the escape to be effected	608.6547
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that dartagnan heard her in the antechamber	101.6498
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern	657.3818
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted	175.3501
ich bin ein deutscher replied the prisoner	27.5959
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety	1011.5837

it is miserabledo you seealways to wait till the end of the month oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting	202.0447
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing	402.3929
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground	368.3750
oh i am dying he again fainted	1553.7118
come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed	148.0231
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco knownfrom the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakiawas exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouthpieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers	903.1750
life itself may be resolved into three words _erat est fuit_ which means said dartagnan who began to suspect the truth	485.8003
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take	122.3706
yes must i leave alone no whom am i to take with me	166.5228
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances	110.5704
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle	336.5167
it is really wonderful said the count above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight it is indeed said danglars	100.0378
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals	300.4985
i therefore may hesitate between you	17.0869
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you	109.9336
he had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts still by degrees nature or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry	733.1163
oh the scotch he exclaimed the scotch i called my faithful to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford the scotch my brothers but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated todaythis morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose to do what	310.5627
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him	164.3082
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents	568.4003
dépinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m	183.6397
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin	303.3563
let us go then said athos	14.8239
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my fathers brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse	98.9804
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house	246.9845
if i had but the time to train pupils but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moments repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england ah _à propos_ of the cardinal monsieur de tréville i am vexed with you this was the chance at which m	176.7135
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	275.2140
he returned to france with the epaulet of sublieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in during the spanish warthat is to say at the time when danglars made his early speculations	143.5069
well then we will put simply _my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared_ my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary	363.5164
the mother and daughter passed the night together	184.3677
ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize halloo halloo friends to horse to horse several horsemen ran quickly to him	550.1729
it was evening i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced	271.6424
nay dear mother say the accused person	14941.8506
do you know where i shall find him near blois	168.4277
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur dartagnan say a great deal about them you know monsieur dartagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes	118.5275
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	250.5286
my dear dantès said he swear to perform what i am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance i swear captain replied i	71.5011
yes but your father died in your arms happy respected rich and full of years his father died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards his tomb had disappeared and no one could say there sleeps the father you so well loved oh exclaimed morrel	389.8283
is he not peculiar he is more than that replied châteaurenaud he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life	89.1032
what are his means of existence	4370.6689
if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand so you know beforehand you must perish said dartagnan	104.9125
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andreas situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and deathdeath without mercy or delay	939.9127
adieu thus tis quite decided said dartagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i repeat i am made up of contradictions	141.7893
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation	146.1092
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness but your eminence replied the prince	108.1018
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends	327.6573
morrel smiled and shook his head	3.8502
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased	757.0547
the major will bring his son with him this evening the _contino_ as we say in italy he confides him to my care	235.5990
the king threw himself into an armchair	111.4544
now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet	145.3117
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before	161.7575
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was dartagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	167.7129
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentlemanthat of the army	124.7362
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere	429.9378
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor	170.5853
they descended into the plain by the ladder	140.7877
oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone	351.8879
where am i and why am i here	131.1158
cocles went first and the stranger followed him	106.3994
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what dartagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons dartagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom	236.9525
i know not where i have left my hat and in all probability i should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all i wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back yes madame but i only came back on one conditionthat i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people the will exclaimed the queen frowning	133.2787
my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire	179.3411
be easy i am a gentleman	338.0907
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a statecouncillor then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly	142.6843
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go the count rang and a footman appeared	192.8121
no it has been stolen from you stolen	941.3983
dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him	505.4435
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed	213.9881
the _facchino_ follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting	8894.3975
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded	4374.4761
you have not forgotten st gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto	237.2792
but do you know where no in the kings room the kings room cried athos	127.3443
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundations website and official page at section	338.2850
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared	125.1736
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible	248.1985
every article of dresshat coat gloves and bootswas from the first makers	602.2180
dartagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase	243.5779
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family	50.4853
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction	376.9082
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits	178.5264
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity	229.4337
has the sun done anything for me	43.8238
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu	136.1596
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause	280.1076
only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle	166.8559
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same	177.0467
oh no exclaimed edmond that will not be	26.7761
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony	189.8352
then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face	303.0276
at a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free ah by jove my lord said dartagnan you have well said but these are only words	120.5388
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said dartagnan	134.3262
yes sir replied the young man naively i felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in spanish from the enemys ranks i closed my eyes and thought of you in honest truth raoul said athos pressing his hand	165.9966
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far	189.6583
courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the queen to her and to you cried dartagnan	69.7901
the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance	69.5448
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur dartagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted	165.1607
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur	134.5101
danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so by what right sir by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more danglars bit his lips	168.2083
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry	615.8516
i wager anything said albert interrupting her that i know what you were about to say well what is it if i guess rightly will you confess it yes on your honor on my honor you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expected not at all	72.0472
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge	763.4466
this is the fourth which you have let fall and i have picked up for in three years madame i have only seen you four timesthe first which i have described to you the second at the mansion of madame de chevreuse the third in the gardens of amiens duke said the queen blushing never speak of that evening oh let us speak of it on the contrary let us speak of it that is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life you remember what a beautiful night it was	96.7788
perhaps you would prefer being alone no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the operaballs	147.4532
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions	192.4255
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can	115.5165
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results	276.6195
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf	214.9563
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy	341.8485
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie said he	185.8255
faith yes it is so long ago answered porthos	616.2773
i shall meet with a victim	1320.3558
the king signed the order for release and tréville carried it away without delay	724.8627
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	491.3182
love me then haydée who knows	198.1291
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected	358.1734
he saw a corpse at his feet	45.3324
you understandno more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	81.0886
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered	154.7187
am i to say what you told me asked valentine	51.1919
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture really this is frightful stop a minute you dont know all yet	268.8360
franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it	62.4086
franz dépinay a delightful travelling companion with whom i made the tour of italy	116.9023
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortuneat least so it is saidand i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeatit is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions	429.7804
the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent	247.7192
dartagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake	267.4414
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said dartagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aidedecamp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle	230.3584
fortunately she is far off said porthos for i confess she would worry me if she were here she worries me in england as well as in france said athos	154.4568
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was guarded	71.0699
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly	9826.6650
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette	1058.9575
dartagnan followed the _soubrette_ with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where dartagnan had disappeared	154.4162
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a lookingglass	381.8230
it is he who in an encounter with your eminences guards decided the victory in favor of the kings musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable dartagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal	145.8480
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal	124.0603
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun	249.0586
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair	124.5215
then you were going to rueil yes i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence you must still deliver it said athos	98.5392
the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m	155.9354
davrigny and villefort laid him on a couch	135.9383
but _mio caro_ did not reply	640.1194
and now go mordaunt before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir a favor from me mordaunt bowed	120.6645
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _pharaon_ and look carefully to the unloading of her freight	153.5467
quick quick tell me what i must do this time are there any fresh instructions	177.4575
in all wellorganized brains the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning	599.7629
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port	221.2601
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely a short carbine and a pair of doublebarrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a singlebarrelled one	383.7227
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand	101.1392
my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct	167.7145
i shall use it again upon occasion and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day dartagnan directed his course toward m	227.7843
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing	453.3134
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself	126.2650
i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself you could do no such thing fernand you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i cannot give you more well i will do better mercédès	162.9617
there is but one favor i would entreat of you speak guard carefully the secret of your birth	464.2509
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix	240.2966
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects	134.7958
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that dartagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois	138.9837
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight	43.0629
milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more	1400.8820
ah why were you not there gentlemen	681.7890
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet	211.9343
if he tells the baron said she i am lostfor the baron who knows very well that i shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more beautiful	164.5362
and i am madame héloïse de villefort the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time	52.5274
a knot of rosecolored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground	103.9588
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	172.9484
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself perhaps you never before noticed him what a questionso truly french do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love true replied franz	218.2423
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save	268.4257
oh mademoiselle mademoiselle cried franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person	329.7408
but my dear count has m	564.9938
what the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of death	677.7654
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you you will bring him then	43.6274
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmores opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annuma precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine	462.4441
dartagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind	126.0207
but ibut i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross leap coward cried raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him courage sir said he courage we are coming to your aid olivain advanced retired then made his horse rearturned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as raoul had done only repeating i am a dead man we are lost in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more	307.0272
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview	328.0436
no no be easy on that score	737.2803
sir said the cardinal you have heard me	39.3060
porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurators wife under the table as it came in search of his	89.0758
i am replied dantès in bad italian a maltese sailor	1596.2737
she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion	81.6112
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company cant do without me there my leave is at an end do you return to paris asked athos quickly	206.3712
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the kings name that they would stop as the king was hungry	83.9903
the next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at st valery	102.0297
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation	221.3652
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at work yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening i hope so monsieur well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said dartagnan and nodding to planchet he went out	151.1249
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services	232.9521
noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him	141.4936
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room	103.7616
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day	94.6604
she extended her hands to him with a smile	42.3927
this child lives and someone knows it livessomeone is in possession of our secret and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret just god avenging god murmured madame danglars	175.6387
at the queens last word dartagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery	197.4593

_la jeune amélie_ had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible	371.6934
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder	298.8049
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours	238.7925
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies	324.6090
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect	293.5105
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow	144.4160
well said the queen it has been refused the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt	113.6535
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen	212.3816
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	376.4695
i would rather have had a hat said dartagnan	81.0880

i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope	197.4208
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the lawthese advocates to promote your majestys welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	209.6891
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him	71.1760
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	153.8101
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers	183.8232
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts	239.8179
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarinimpossible an italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves	302.1307
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantlepieces with flowers	1831.8978
my god he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually ali looked at his master for further instructions	392.7625
from that glass door the palefaced man went to the counts bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard	316.5287
caligula or nero those treasureseekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for	261.3916
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore	91.6177
i should be glad however to receive your excellencys commands concerning the dinner really my dear m	151.4260
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queens apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty	183.5266
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of anotherconfide my shame to you a man and i a woman	220.8738
gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit	187.6777
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme	271.7887
approach gentlemen said albert i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it strange as it may appear to you proceed sir said the count	47.7554
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp	411.5378
andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess	69.8409
we must then as it appears to me travel in company	233.8694
he opened the door quickly and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild	228.4282
religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions	1258.4801
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza	297.1063
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day	184.7252
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end	164.5654
de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving hereyou did see him i think yes well well m	668.8887
then he drew from his waistcoatpocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand	281.6101
do you still wish to dispose of all yes but they will contest the will after your death no my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i cannot plead against the poor the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph	183.6466
if you know monsieur de tréville you must have visited him often said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end	144.6826
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	61.4368
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the _lorgnette_ and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human	205.5798
yes a chef doeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos	2994.1523
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child	44.1463
you meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist politics	13850.2881
it appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy what do you mean sir i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion	140.9850
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy	124.8181
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph project gutenberg is a registered trademark	74.0577
indeed why you knew it porthos said aramis	107.1340
porthos said dartagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me oh good heaven said planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen i will tell you all about it replied mousqueton	104.1596
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said dartagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick dartagnan	80.9490
this lady is infamous my lord milady de winter is an angel you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you bah are you mad to talk to me thus said buckingham	109.3902
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor	426.2622
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair m who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young mans ears	130.5750
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself yes sir then you have seen him certainly i have where	58.8941
it closed after him with a spring	66.1367
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbitsfor the abbé adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guineapigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit	300.4485
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb	208.5503
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort	22.5641
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion	213.8005
dartagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times	427.4356
he began gathering the grapeleaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener	130.1296
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris	117.3190
de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity oh yes said châteaurenaud	954.1763
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the baroness	126.1238
it has arrived at the hôtel des princes rue de richelieu	165.2364
one may be very comfortable in a convent and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated i promise you on my part good cried athos good yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly	156.4721
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of dartagnan who however placed himself between him and them	163.3747
and the disappearance of his money how am i to justify it if i am here you are right we must go out go out	88.1499
in particular there is one yonder of a gascon look	454.1577
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk	160.6392
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner	201.4535
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him	101.2690
but continued dartagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window	103.9319
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard dartagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal	189.5972
yes go go said she to her brother the effects _are_ drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them silence was reestablished	365.1381
though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country brutal politics i must confess said maximilian but dont attach any serious importance dear to what your father said	594.1655
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontainesaintgeorges and stopped at no where lord wilmore lived	203.9358
they are two hotheadsthe one a gascon the other from picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately	605.9951
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and i are under such important obligations chapter v	273.6945
it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces	507.1885
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the barons house there has been a misunderstanding what with the baroness no with the baron has he perceived anything ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness	143.4231
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell	122.8956
does your excellency wish me to accompany him no the coachman ali and baptistin will go the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars	104.1626
morrel he said who was he the owner of the _pharaon_ and patron of dantès and what part did he play in this sad drama inquired the abbé	165.4240
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	446.2184
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him yes yes cried both young men	79.9802
and remember my life depends on your answer	96.1689
to saint peters first and then to the colosseum returned albert	155.8333
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast	142.3353
they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions	768.4979
yes he has entered it is for you or me my god how agitated you seem yes i admit it	120.3579
what more do you want i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person absolutely then as i said before sirvery well i am ready to marry m	164.8633
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy	151.1285
the chateau he said to himself what chateau	1772.4554
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son	161.5057
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers	481.3560
the island of tiboulen dantès although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower	222.7381
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquiredehmy friend aramis paused	183.3269
if the abbé busoni should by any accident return think of me in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in a few days true but that makes no difference	260.0930
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of buckingham gave dartagnan a chamber adjoining his own	175.7262
de monte cristo you must demand an explanation yes and we are going to his house reflect morcerf one moment before you go on what shall i reflect on the importance of the step you are taking is it more serious than going to m	130.7682
he pressed the counts hand and left	69.9648
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged	234.5076
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination a problem my dear count for everyonefor my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear	449.4841
think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace	239.1829
_a propos_ add one thing what i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden	586.9804
the lackey bowed and let them pass	109.2194
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dantès do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned	189.9572
the shade of richelieu was mazarin	1298.1562
he is pursued but where is he	23.8471
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to dartagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secretsonly she believed she could say she was not dead	272.4255
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary yes so it is between perfectly upright people one word more said monte cristo	324.0116
it was a tolerably fine winters day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison	316.8058
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists	829.7945
rather place faith in what i tell you	28.1980
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades	107.9895
in the first place light me a torch ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment	130.0382
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel it is his voice said julie	92.7130
you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door go sir said the queen i will follow you dartagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box	58.3576
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo	105.7647
franz and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him on whom thenon me on you	458.4357
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber	180.6642
a circle was formed around them	132.4854
morrel obeyed guided by valentine he had learned how to understand the old man quickly	84.1580
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts	1250.8063
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself demolished	640.3532
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude	197.1370
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite	211.8793
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room	1924.7310
m are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile	717.7158
ere long marseilles presented herself to viewmarseilles white fervid full of life and energymarseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterraneanmarseilles old yet always young	693.9487
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host goodnight and mounted the stairs	251.9508
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then i felt that i was lost felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body	335.0956
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and saidupon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner	188.2133
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price	229.7272
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwells	644.1255
you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the counts hands pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that life is endurable to sufferers	192.2601
i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed	122.9290
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	565.1960
i have the honor to be with respect etc marechal de grammont at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i	168.7918
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress	104.0090
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words	221.2350
read me her letter oh my lord said laporte	62.6649
as to dartagnan he sprang toward jussac himself	1461.2811
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said	162.2816
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening	74.4539
where are you going oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me	241.2478
but you my dear dartagnan what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said dartagnan	122.5785
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it the marquis of saintméran returned the count	84.5138
morrel had better godo you not think so grandpapa yes signed the old man	223.5997
you and how by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring	631.8851
upon this promise dartagnan withdrew and the next day he began service	215.1762
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket	492.6928
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone	158.0972
no matter he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him	52.1443
no no like shakespeares polonius he died for another	159.2706
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain	165.0367
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses	106.5622
ali bring me some water the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting	307.4119
thank you la ramee said the prisoner	35.7451
mazarin started turned toward the comte de la fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen	113.5746
friends said athos do you regret you have not shed our blood no replied dartagnan i regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other	277.4138
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman	170.9324
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to dartagnans deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville	125.2087
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her	171.8514
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck	189.2659
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twentyone	468.0974
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughters room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child	238.7632
i receive him among the number of my friends	73.8680
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder	80.2060
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot	127.1893
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spini feel very keenly fernand that this is charity and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles what do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper and where can i look for these better than in you fernand answered mercédès shaking her head a woman becomes a bad manager and who shall say she will remain an honest woman when she loves another man better than her husband	242.4512
you seek me sir said he	19.1416
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics	158.8443
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself exactly therefore i think of sending him away from here you will be wise to do so no doubt of it but it will break his heart	143.4343
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit	80.1510
sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you speak out my friend i am afraid to do so	79.0868
igad underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask are you one of the fronde they unsheathe and thats all that is said	292.2295
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other i dont say exactly answered the gascon confused	101.0517
the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head	271.3769
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count	71.9950
there was no more to be had in saint germain	174.9669

her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond chapter	475.3569
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept dartagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love	669.7820

for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers	449.6193
eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away	186.1649

knock said the count and announce me bertuccio knocked the door opened and the concierge appeared	140.2919
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned	682.7061
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord	176.0612
we must proceed in an orderly manner hush said grimaud he is coming out	317.0371
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered	137.5760
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilians room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still	195.4954
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force	95.4276
kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should i do so why you said answered mademoiselle danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals m bah said cavalcanti crossing his arms one has friends the brigadier advanced to him sword in hand	153.3103
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice	439.1805

cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure	183.3167
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman	338.6325
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche	98.8026
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and dartagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche	119.0244
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve you serve the cardinal yes madame and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart	106.6010
come back sirs back the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistolshot and cries for help were heard	195.3841
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if i satisfy some i shall displease others	472.5119
devil take it he muttered to himself dont let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them well then said athos what are your schemes	141.0031
however there are plenty in the world but you dont look in the right direction for them my lord indeed explain to me	100.6652
davrigny cried villefort or rather i will go for him myself he flew from the apartment and morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door	64.2975
if you be a priest i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man if you be not it is a different matter and i warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that i shall chastise you for your insolence the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult	122.6189
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine	350.5540
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us all replied mordaunt	103.7499
it will be even more difficult to descend dartagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him	195.0704
the jailer brought him his breakfast	1805.7764
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean	124.8325
all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur dartagnan is doubtless true said the queen but i have confidence in you alone	78.5095
now sir i am listeninggo on i will come at once to the point	57.9544
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st peters	2132.8950
de la trémouilles people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them	105.5738
the arts change about and make a tour of the world things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow themthat is all but there is always the same result	246.1626
i am a priest resumed aramis	41.7637
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but dartagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kittys apartment	264.4427
you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave paris bringing them with you to cours la reine	130.8055
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal	104.2927
dartagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour	191.1444
he had his foot upon it that is all and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation	130.7890
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur dartagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen	66.5821
not at all why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there beforemaking in all about two hundred francswhy i should certainly be arrested at the barriers	394.1223
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes	170.0592
is that your opinion dherblay yes said aramis we have promised then continued athos we have another reason it is thislisten in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry	139.6605
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secretservice money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob	200.3703
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of crossexamination which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin	257.4722

and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos	94.1517
moreover dartagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character	182.4545

he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed	520.6715
it had been dartagnans practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles	252.4884

well dantès you do not thank me this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only	66.3230
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the nexta sublime spot a restingplace full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking	244.7522
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by wellarched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sexher nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno	585.1686

the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself	466.1953

this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power he hated and adored her at the same time	186.7872

unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twentyfive pistoles for which he had given his word	166.6317
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her power one thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athosthe best friend of dartagnan	182.3876

besides you owe me some thanks	2070.1699
yes well as for me i prefer hannibal and why pray master la ramee asked the duke	210.6137
